MESSAGE OF THE SECRETARY
The 2018-2040 Philippine Energy Plan (PEP)
is the second energy plan in support of the 
government’s AmBisyon Natin 2040 platform. The 
Plan seeks to uplift the well-being of all Filipinos by 
securing access to reliable and affordable energy 
services and technologies. It also looks at 
enforceable policies and feasible programs to 
support the government’s goal of achieving 
inclusive growth for all.
Energy and power have become an indispensable 
need in our modern world. Advances in 
technological innovations have made demand for 
energy more compelling. And to meet that basic 
need, the DOE is tasked to deliver its mandate of 
ensuring that energy is readily available to make lives comfortable and our businesses
competitive. However, the complex energy challenges facing us today require long-term 
strategies, strong collaboration, and firm decision-making to achieve realistic and long-term 
solutions to the increasing energy demands of the country.
Thus, this PEP outlines the energy priorities that are innovative, sustainable, and clean. 
Through this Plan, we hope to advance initiatives on the smart use of renewable energy, 
natural gas and other emerging technologies, as well as the promotion and deployment of 
alternative fuels and technologies. 
Moreover, we look forward to an energy efficient economy with the signing of Republic Act
11285 or the National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act of 2019. This policy will make 
energy efficiency and conservation a national way of life for all stakeholders. 
In all these undertakings, we seek to promote the sustainable production and consumption 
of energy resources to achieve the country’s overall economic development goals, reduce 
poverty, strengthen competitiveness and reduce environmental costs. 
But above everything else, this Plan seeks to enhance our stakeholders’ greater 
understanding of the DOE’s key policies, programs, and developments with the goal of 
engaging them in building a stronger energy system for the country.
 
With these initiatives in place, a brighter energy future awaits us all!TABLE OF CONTENTS

Figure 106. Way ForwardSecretary Alfonso G. Cusi, during the turnover ceremony as the new Chief of the Department of 
Energy (DOE) in July 2016, highlighted the Department’s mission of improving the lives of Filipinos. 
To achieve this call, the DOE Secretary directed the energy sector to concentrate on specific areas 
that promote a “consumer first” perspective, provide a level playing field for all stakeholders, and 
bring about change, which should start at the very core of government service.
President Rodrigo R. Duterte signed Executive Order (EO) 5 in October 2016 adopting a 25-year 
long-term vision known as the AmBisyon Natin 2040, which sees the Philippines as a “prosperous,
predominantly middle-class society by 2040.” The EO required all plans of the government 
agencies, offices and instrumentalities, including government-owned or -controlled corporations 
(GOCC) and LGUs shall be consistent with the said vision. 
The government’s long-term vision packaged under the AmBisyon Natin 2040 expects that by 
2040, Filipinos will have a strongly rooted, comfortable and secure life. To realize this vision, the 
DOE responded with the formulation of the Philippine Energy Plan (PEP) 2018-2040 that embodies
a clear set of objectives, namely:
a) Increase the production of clean and indigenous sources of energy to meet the growing 
economic development of the country;
b) Decrease the wasteful utilization of energy through the use of energy efficiency tools and 
strategies; and
c) Ensure the balance between the provision of reliable and reasonably priced energy 
services, support for economic growth, and protection of the environment.
And just like AmBisyon Natin 2040, the PEP lays down the foundation to ensure that Filipinos gain 
from the deliverables set forth in the energy roadmaps by 2040, specifically covering the following 
areas:
I. Ensuring Energy Services 24/7;
II. Creating Wealth for Filipinos;
III. Consumer Empowerment; and,
IV. Philippine Agenda with the International Community.The PEP likewise embodies the policies and laws that support the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goal (SDG) of affordable and clean energy, such as the Renewable Energy Act, 
Energy Efficiency Act, and the policy on Resiliency of Energy System and Infrastructure. These are 
integrated in the energy demand and supply scenarios of the PEP as briefly explained in the 
succeeding discussions below on energy outlook and presented in Chapter II of this plan. 
The SDG 7 on energy intends to 
correct the imbalances through 
access to affordable, reliable, and 
modern energy services by 2030. 
Energy is at the core of the SDGs being 
the “Golden Thread”1that connects 
and supports the others goals like 
addressing poverty and ending 
hunger, economic growth, 
infrastructure and industrialization, 
reduce inequality, inclusive and 
resilient cities, and climate change. 
Energy is critical as there is no 
development without fueling the 
engine of growth, which is access to 
sustainable energy. 
I. ENSURING ENERGY SERVICES 24/7
A. 2018 ENERGY SITUATIONER
1. LONG-TERM ENERGY STRATEGIC DIRECTION
In support of the AmBisyon Natin 
2040 and in pursuit of responsive 
delivery of public service, the DOE 
has been guided by the eight (8) 
Energy Sector Strategic Directions, 
which are envisioned to be 
implemented progressively during 
the planning period. These
strategies encompass the 
government’s call towards inclusive 
growth, high trust society and a globally competitive knowledge economy.
In the medium-term, the DOE focuses on the Nine-Point Energy Agenda with priorities on 
consumer-first policies, reliability of energy supply and affordability. And central to the energy 
agenda are:
1 As mentioned by Former Secretary-General of United Nations
Ban Ki-moon▪ Access to Basic 
Electricity for All 
Filipinos by 2022. 
Achieve a 100.0 
percent electrification 
level by 2022 based on 
2015 Census, 
especially in 
Mindanao and off-grid 
areas, by improving 
electricity supplies 
and upgrading the 
transmission and 
distribution network.
▪ Adopting a Technology Neutral Approach for an Optimal Energy Mix. A priority toward a 
reliable, sustainable and affordable energy mix to meet the domestic energy requirements. 
▪ Improving the Supply of Power that is Reliable to Meet Demand Needs by 2040. Ensure that 
committed power generation projects are operational as needed to include the adoption of a 
25.0 percent reserve capacity requirement for system reliability.
i
▪ Developing Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) needs for the future in anticipation of the Malampaya 
Field’s depletion. Accelerate the implementation of LNG projects for natural gas supply security 
once the Malampaya gas resource is exhausted in 2024. 
▪ Facilitating the Completion of Transmission Projects by 2022. Fast-track the completion of the 
Mindanao-Visayas Interconnection Project by 2021 and other potential small island 
interconnections, such as Mindoro-Batangas, Semirara-Occidental Mindoro, and Sulu-Basilan 
(please see Annex 28).
▪ Pro-Consumer Distribution Framework for Affordability, Choice and Transparency. Policy 
implementation of the Retail Competition and Open Access (RCOA) and the Green Energy 
Option (GEOP) provides the consumers with power to choose their energy sources. 
▪ Streamlining Domestic Policy to Cut Red Tape. The promulgation of the Energy Virtual One Stop 
Shop (EVOSS) under Republic Act (RA) 11234 or EVOSS Act of 2019 and the EO 30 signed by 
President Duterte in June 2017 streamlined the process and harmonized the regulatory 
frameworks of the government agencies (including local government units/LGUs) in the 
issuance of permits/licenses for energy projects. These policies support the Ease of Doing 
Business and the Efficient Government Service Delivery Act of 2018 (RA 11032), which aims to 
simplify current systems and procedures of government services. The recently issued 
Administrative Order (AO) 23 on 27 February 2020 by the President intends to eradicate 
overregulation and improve the government system in delivering services to the people.
From these platforms, development and completion of energy projects will then be speed up 
and integrated in the energy systems as scheduled, thus providing continuous, stable and 
reliable energy supply. ▪ Deliver on PSALM privatization. In compliance with the Electric Power Industry Act (EPIRA), 
the privatization of the remaining PSALM assets will have to be accelerated to meet its 
mandated goals prior to the end of its corporate life in 2026.
▪ Promoting Efficient Use of Power among Consumers through an Information, Education and 
Communication (IEC) campaign. Continue to promote efficient use of electricity among 
consumers through the implementation of the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act (EE&C) 
or RA 11285 signed on 12 April 2019. The Act establishes a framework for introducing and 
institutionalizing fundamental policies on energy efficiency and conservation, promotion of 
efficient and judicious utilization of energy, and increased use of energy-efficiency technologies 
that will result in reduced dependence on imported fuel.
A sectoral roadmap has been crafted for each energy subsector containing long-term objectives, 
deliverables and targets consistent with the Strategic Directions and the Nine-Point Agenda as 
mentioned above. The following are some of the deliverables and targets over the planning 
period: 
▪ Ensure Quality, Reliable, Affordable and Secure Supply, Expanding Electricity Access, and 
Ensuring a Transparent and Fair Playing Field in the Power Industry. Focusing on full 
restructuring and reforms in the power sector, the roadmaps (power industry subsectors) 
highlight the sector’s priorities for more efficient delivery of electricity services from 
generation, transmission and distribution networks, down to the end-users, and ensuring that 
all have equitable access to electricity. 
▪ Improve Policies in the Downstream Oil Industry for Continuous Supply of High Quality and Right 
Quantity of Petroleum Products. The continuous development and updating of fuel quality 
standards and code of safety practices, as well as amending or revising the governing policies 
to address the industry challenges form part of the sector’s roadmap. The DOE’s advocacy in 
the sector is the establishment of a strategic oil stockpiling program to minimize the impact on 
the economy of rising oil prices in the world market. 
▪ Establish a World-Class, Investment Driven and Efficient Natural Gas Industry. An urgent 
deliverable of the sector’s roadmap is the formulation of policies and legislative framework to 
support the development of the downstream natural gas industry and expand its market reach. 
The DOE envisions the Philippines to be a liquefied natural gas (LNG) trading and trans-shipment 
hub in the Asia-Pacific Region. 
▪ Secure and Stable Energy Supply through a Technology- Responsive Energy Sector. The 
Alternative Fuels and Energy Technology (AFET) roadmap targets the identification of AFET for 
implementation, as well as the preparation of regulatory and infrastructure requirements for 
mainstreaming in the transportation sector. Priority technologies for promotion are electric 
vehicles (EVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), liquefied petroleum gas vehicles (Auto LPG), and 
compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles. 
▪ Pursue Significant Initiatives after the passage of the EE&C Act. After enactment into law, 
priority initiatives of the roadmap focus on the integration and mainstreaming of EE&C at the 
LGU level as a continuing program. The LGUs will have to develop and implement the Local 
Energy Efficiency and Conservation Plan (LEECP) to be incorporated in the local development 
plan. Likewise, EE&C will be included in the learning and education system. With the strategies 
identified in the roadmap, the overall objective is to reduce energy intensity of the country. 2. ENERGY DEVELOPMENT OVER THE YEARS
The Philippines is only blessed with modest amount of indigenous energy resources, specifically 
fossil fuels, thus importing fuel has been an option to augment energy supply for domestic 
requirement. If the rate of economic development is faster than the development of indigenous 
energy, heavy reliance on imported energy persists. However, there are energy resources that 
remain untapped, and harnessing these improves the energy sufficiency level of the country.
Previous administrations attempted to achieve the ideal scenario of having enough indigenous 
fuels for domestic consumption. During President Ferdinand Marcos regime, where the major 
focus was infrastructure development, the energy agenda enticed the administration to set its 
priorities on indigenous energy development. It was in this era that geothermal energy started to 
be developed, upstream coal exploration was bannered, and energy diversification, through the 
non-conventional resources, was introduced. 
The Bataan Nuclear Power Plant (BNPP) was constructed during Marcos period. Initial discussions 
on nuclear energy development were tabled at the time of President Ramon Magsaysay, but later 
facilitated and expedited by President Marcos. However, President Corazon Aquino, decided to 
mothball the BNPP2 due to alleged safety and social issues. 
Succeeding administrations in the recent decades recognized self-sufficiency and energy 
independence as major elements of energy security. Such led to a paradigm shift from being 
heavily dependent on the use of conventional energy to greater integration of renewable 
resources and alternative fuels. To complement the competitive use of different fuels and 
subsequently reduce wasteful energy consumption, the EE&C Act was finally enacted under 
President Duterte after being shelved for more than a decade before the legislative and executive 
bodies finally recognized its importance.
3. TOTAL FINAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION
The country’s Total Final Energy Consumption (TFEC) in 2018 increased by 1.3 percent from 
previous year’s level of 33.9 million tons of oil equivalent (MTOE) to 34.3 MTOE. The transport, 
household and service sectors registered an increase in their energy uses, while the industry and 
agriculture sectors recorded a decline during the same period.
By Sector
The transport sector remained the most energy-intensive sector, accounting for more than a third 
(35.7 percent) of the TFEC. Its aggregate energy demand reached 12.2 MTOE, 3.5 percent higher 
than its 2017 level due to increased utilization of gasoline and diesel for road transport, as well as 
aviation turbo for domestic air transport. 
Household energy consumption was 27.5 percent of the demand mix, as it posted an increase of 
2.6 percent in 2018, reaching 9.4 MTOE during the period. The industry’s energy consumption 
dropped by 5.1 percent, from 7.9 MTOE in 2017 to 7.5 MTOE in 2018, translated to a 21.9 percent 
share of the TFEC. The decreased was attributed to the slowdown in production output from the 
2 To date
the BNPP has not been operatedindustrial sector, particularly in energy-intensive manufacturing subsectors, such as non-metallic 
(including cement) minerals, chemical products and basic metal industries.
The service sector’s energy consumption rose by 6.0 percent or 4.7 MTOE from the 2017 level of 
4.4 MTOE, equivalent to a 13.6 percent share of the TFEC. This was largely driven by the resilient 
performance of the services sector, particularly hotels and restaurants. The production cuts in the 
agriculture sector caused its energy use to fall by as much as 14.8 percentin 2018, recorded at 439.6 
thousand tons of oil equivalent (kTOE), about 1.0 percent of the TFEC. 
By Fuel
Oil products accounted for almost half of the TFEC, with consumption increased by 3.4 percent 
from last year’s level to 16.9 MTOE in 2018. Notwithstanding the fluctuations in domestic pump 
prices during most parts of 2018, coupled with the implementation of the excise tax provision 
under the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) Act, consumption of gasoline and 
diesel used primarily for road transport went up by 3.0 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively. The 
combined share of these fuels was nearly 80.0 percent of the total petroleum consumption. 
The consumption of biomass3for end-use applications contributed a 21.3 percent to the TFEC 2018, 
albeit a measly 0.5 percent growth during the period. Of the 7.3 MTOE of biomass consumed in 
2018, households accounted for the bulk at 78.8 percent, while the remaining share was utilized by 
the service and manufacturing sectors, particularly for sugar and food processing. 
Electricity was 20.7 percent of the TFEC with its consumption up by 6.2 percent, reaching 7.1 MTOE
in 2018 from its year-ago level of 6.7 MTOE. Both the industrial and household sectors registered 
close to one-third share of the total electricity consumption, while 29.1 percent was used by the 
commercial sector.
Coal consumption for end-use applications registered a decline of 19.8 percent from the 2017 level 
of 3.0 MTOE to 2.4 MTOE in 2018 due to merging of two (2) local cement producers and the surged 
in imported cement that contributed to the reduction in local cement production during the year. 
Meanwhile, despite meager share of 0.2 percent of the TFEC, natural gas for end-use applications 
rose by 13.1 percent in 2018 caused by high off-take of the Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation 
(PSPC).
Biofuels utilization of coco methyl ester (CME) and ethanol went up by 2.9 percent with combined 
levels reaching 524.0 kTOE in 2018 as a result of compliance to biofuel blend rate as mandated 
under the Biofuels Law of 2006 or RA 9367.
4. POWER GENERATION
Power generation output posted an increase of 5.7 percent from the 2017 level to 99.8 terawatthour (TWh)in 2018. Coal provided about half of the country’s power generation requirement, while 
natural gas contributed 21.4 percent and geothermal with 10.5 percent share of the total power 
generation. The combined renewable share of total power generation was down to 23.4 percent 
in 2018 from 25.4 percent a year ago. 
Total fuel inputs for power generation went up to 29.7 MTOE in 2018, a 5.5 percent increase from 
previous year’s level. Fossil fuels accounted for 60.0 percent as coal increased its share of the 
total power generation to cover for the reduced hydropower output. Consequently, the 
3
Includes charcoalfuelwoodrice hullbagasseagriculture and animal wastecombined input of renewable energy to power generation only grew by 0.6 percent. The increase 
in natural gas generation required 3.3 MTOE of fuel input, while oil with a decrease of 16.2 percent 
in its power generation, resulted in a 24.6 percent reduction in fuel input. 
5. TOTAL PRIMARY ENERGY SUPPLY 
The country’s total primary energy supply (TPES) reached 59.7 MTOE in 2018, a growth of 2.9 
percent from its 2017 level of 58.0 MTOE. The self-sufficiency level, expressed as the ratio of total 
indigenous energy to total primary supply, was registered at 50.2 percent in 2018, lower by 0.7 
percentage points from 50.9 percent in 2017. Net energy imports posted a 4.6 percent hike from 
28.4 MTOE in 2017 to 29.7 MTOE in 2018 due to sluggish growth in aggregate indigenous energy 
production of 1.4 percent growth from contraction in oil, coal and hydro production.
Oil has been the major source of energy supply, which accounted for about a third (33.5 percent) 
of the TPES, followed by coal with 27.4 percent and geothermal with 15.o percent shareof the TPES. 
Natural gas supply exhibited the fastest growth at 11.6 percent, while coal supply rose by 5.7 
percent from increased importation. 
The aggregate supply of renewable energy went up by 0.6 percent to 19.7 MTOE, 34.1 percent of 
the TPES, with notable contributions from wind and solar, biofuels and geothermal.
6. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION
Total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from energy-related activities increased by 4.1 percent, or 
123.3 million tons of CO2 equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2018 from 118.5 MtCO2e the previous year. All 
sectors contributed to the rise in GHG, specifically from power generation and transport. The 
power generation contributed more than half (51.7 percent) of the total GHG emissions in 2018, 
while the transport sector 27.9 percent. The considerable growth in GHG emissions is mainly due 
to utilization of coal for power generation and oil in the transport sector.
7. ENERGY, ECONOMY AND ENVIRONMENT INDICATORS
Economy-wide energy intensity declined by 3.4 percent, which registered at 6.4 tons of oil 
equivalent per million pesos of real GDP (TOE/MPhP) in 2018, from improvement of energy 
efficiency efforts across all economic sectors.
The energy-to-GDP elasticity was reported at 0.4, while oil supply to GDP elasticity recorded at 0.1
in 2018. These values indicate that the overall volume of energy, as well as that of oil, utilized as 
fuel remained steady despite increased economic output. Meanwhile, electricity had higher 
elasticity at 0.9, indicating more electricity was utilized with respect to economic output.
Energy per capita level went up by 1.0 percent to 0.56 TOE/person in 2018, from last year’s 0.55 
TOE/person. Electricity per capita posted a 4.1 percent growth from the previous year’s level to 
reach 936 kWh/person, while oil per capita stood at 1.46 barrel/person. Improved energy and 
electricity per capita levels in 2018 reflected increased access to energy services from extensive 
efforts of the government and stakeholders in the energy sector.
Total GHG emissions for every PhP 100,000 of the economic output (measured in terms of real 
GDP) stood at 1.34 tons of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e), 2.0 percent lower than the previous year’s level 
of 1.37 tCO2e.8. LEAST COST TO CONSUMERS
Assessment of basic energy services
Gasoline, diesel and electricity were the most utilized fuels in 2018, representing shares of 13.2 
percent, 26.0 percent and 19.9 percent, respectively, of the TFEC. In June 2018, domestic pump 
prices of gasoline and diesel went up by as much as PhP 11.92/liter and PhP 14.91/liter, respectively, 
due to the imposition of first tranche of additional excise taxes mandated under the TRAIN Law. 
Similarly, electricity prices registered average increments of PhP0.92/kWh for residential, PhP
0.89/kWh for commercial and PhP1.03/kWh for industrial customers. Despite price hikes, 
consumption levels of these fuels also increased in 2018 from its year-ago levels reflecting the price 
inelasticity attribute of basic energy services. 
On the average, the cost components of the pump prices of gasoline and diesel show that fuel 
costs (imports and biofuel costs) account for the bulk share at around 50-60 percent of the 
prevailing domestic pump prices. For electricity prices, generation charge gets the biggest chunk 
from 50.0 to more than 60.0 percent of each customer type classification rate. 
Policy towards Unbundling
Electricity rates are already unbundled as mandated under Section 36 of the EPIRA. It paved the 
way for transparency in the cost components for each customer classification, thus allowing 
consumers the freedom to make informed decisions towards the least-cost consumption of 
electricity. 
Despite the oil industry being deregulated (much similar to the current structure of the power 
industry), pump prices have remained unbundled. The DOE sees the need to unbundle pump prices 
for greater transparency and avoid anti-competitive behavior among the players.
Job Creation in the Power Sector
The power sector provided the economy with a total of 5,050 additional jobs in 2018, out of which, 
910 jobs were for operations and maintenance of power plants and 4,139 jobs during construction 
period. Coal-fired power plants were the most labor-intensive, followed by geothermal and 
hydropower. 
B. ENERGY SUPPLY AND DEMAND OUTLOOK 2018-2040
The Energy Outlook presents two scenarios – the Reference Scenario (REF) or the Business-asUsual (BAU) and the Clean Energy Scenario (CES) as an alternative. The Outlook likewise 
incorporates the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation’s (APEC) aspirational target to reduce 
aggregate energy intensity by 25.0 percent in 2030 to 45.0 percent in 2035 (2005 as the base year 
period), and the ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation (APAEC) 2016-2025 target reduction 
in energy intensity of 20.0 percent in 2020 and 30.0 percent by 2025 with a revised target of 32.0-
35.0 percent under the APAEC Phase II 2021-2025. For the assumptions used in the scenarios, please 
refer to Chapter II of the PEP. 1. REFERENCE SCENARIO (REF) VS. CLEAN ENERGY SCENARIO (CES)
Total Final Energy Consumption
The CES results in a slower growth of the TFEC at 4.4 percent a year requiring 87.7 MTOE in 2040,
which is 9.3 percent lower than the REF. The transport sector contributes the largest share in 
energy demand reduction with 63.7 percent of the 9.0 MTOE decrease in the CES. 
The decline in the transport energy demand significantly pushes down the oil consumption, which 
reaches 43.9 MTOE in the CES by 2040 vis-à-vis 51.5 MTOE under the REF. The factors attributed to 
such is the fuel diversification, improvement of vehicle efficiency standards in the transport sector, 
as well as the expected energy savings from the consumption of petroleum products under the 
CES. This also leads to a drop in oil share to 50.0 percent under the CES from 53.2 percent in the 
REF. 
As electricity displaces some amount of oil consumption in the transport sector under the CES, its 
share expands to 32.3 percent of the TFEC from 30.5 percent in the REF. However, the aggregate 
level is 4.0 percent lower than in the REF due to electricity savings from other end-use sectors. The 
increasing penetration of EVs and the transport modal shift through full operation of the expanded 
and modernized railway systems contribute to the drop in oil consumption in the CES. 
Power Sector
Total Electricity Consumption
Under the REF, total electricity consumption increases by four-fold from 2018 level of 82,602 
gigawatt-hour (GWh) to 343,516 GWh in 2040 under the REF. The target electricity savings in the 
CES reduces consumption by 4.0 percent equivalent to 329,786 GWh. 
With higher EV penetration and the expanded mass and light railway system, electricicty 
consumption of the transport sector increases by two times the level in the REF. The transport 
sector share of the total electricity consumption improves from 0.1 percent in 2018 to about 9.0 
percent in 2040. Bulk of electricity demand comes from the industry and residential sectors over 
the planning period. 
Peak Demand and Capacity Requirements
Under the CES, the projected peak demand stands at 57,303 megawatts (MW), a 4.5 percent lower 
than the REF with 60,034 MW. To meet the peak demand, the CES requires more total installed 
power generating capacity of 93,482 MW, or an additional dependable capacity of 75,325 MW by 
2040 to satisfy a lower peak demand, as compared with 90,584 MW installed capacity to provide 
a dependable capacity of 71,817 MW under the REF. The high requirement for additional capacity 
in the CES is attributed to having more renewables in the system, specifically solar and wind that 
are considered variable capacity. Aside from renewables, the CES takes up additional capacities 
from natural gas and other low carbon and highly efficient technologies.
The Luzon grid’s peak demand rises to 39,987 MW by 2040, four (4) times higher than the 2018 
level. The demand growth necessitates a total additional capacity of 45,740 MW by end of the 
planning period comprising 15,220 MW of baseload capacity, 8,400 MW of intermediate capacity, 
18,500 of variable capacity, 3,200 MW of flexible capacity, and 420 MW of peaking capacity. The Visayas grid's peak demand increases by more than four-fold from its 2018 level, which stands 
at 9,774 MW in 2040. This requires 8,564 MW of additional capacity – 5,000 MW of baseload 
capacity, 700 MW of intermediate capacity, 1,324 MW of variable capacity, 1,340 MW of flexible 
capacity, and 200 MW of peaking capacity.
In Mindanao grid, its peak demand expands by about five (5) times, reaching 10,273 MW in 2040. 
A total 13,041 MW is needed by the end of 2040 to meet the demand growth, broken down as 6,553 
MW of baseload capacity, 200 MW of intermediate capacity, 5148 MW of variable capacity, 1,100 
MW of flexible capacity, and 40 MW of peaking capacity.
Gross Power Generation and Fuel Inputs
Total gross generation increases by 6.5 percent a year, from 99.8 TWh in 2018 to 394.5 TWh in 2040
in the REF. Coal contributes more than half of the total power generation requirement, while
renewables provide an aggregate average share of 27.5 percent and natural gas with 13.7 percent. 
Total fuel input requirement for power generation rises by 5.3 percent over the planning period, 
which stands at 93.5 MTOE in 2040 from 29.7 MTOE in 2018. Fossil fuel accounts for nearly threefourth of the fuel input mix by end of the planning period due to increased share of coal. 
In the CES, generation outputregisters a slower growth rate at 6.3 percent annually reaching 378.8 
TWh in 2040. In this scenario, generation changes significantly as the share of coal drops to 33.4 
percent with greater contributions from renewables, natural gas and other clean energy
technologies. Gross generation from clean energy sources expands by almost six-fold, from 44.7 
TWh in 2017 to 251.2 TWh in 2040. Aggregate share of clean energy improves to 66.3 percent of 
the total generation by 2040. 
With the entry of more efficient coal technologies in the CES, its share of the fuel input mix 
decelerates to 38.8 percent as compared with 61.9 percent under the REF. 
Total Primary Energy Supply 
The TPES under the REF escalates at an average rate of 4.6 percent a year reaching 160.7 MTOE in 
2040 from 59.7 MTOE in 2018. Coal and oil remain as the dominate fuel in the supply mix with more 
than a quarter share of the TPES for each fuel. Aggregate contribution from renewables stands at 
27.2 percent, while natural gas accounts for remaining 4.4 percent average share over the planning 
period. 
In the CES, the TPES only grows at 4.1 percent a year equivalent to 145.7 MTOE, which is 9.3 percent 
lower than the REF. Combined share of coal and oil reduce by 4.4 percentage points (64.1 percent 
in the CES and 68.5 percent in the REF), on average. The decrease is due to expanding use of 
alternatives in transport, greater use of renewables and highly efficient technologies.
Renewables aggregate supply rises to 44.3 MTOE, and diffusion of other technologies in the CES 
contributes 1.6 MTOE to the TPES by 2040. The country’s energy self-sufficiency level in the CES 
improves to 64.1 percent in 2040 as compared with 58.0 percent under the REF.Scenario Implications
Energy Intensity Reduction 
Energy intensity level declines by 48.1 percent in the REF, translated to 3.3 TOE/MPhP in 2040 from 
6.4 TOE/MPhP in 2018. Larger reduction in energy intensity is achieved in the CES with 53.0 percent 
drop from 2018 level (3.0 TOE/MPhP). In terms of APEC and ASEAN targets on energy intensity 
reduction, both scenarios satisfy such with the following reduction levels based on 2005:
▪ 2020 - 32.0 percent (REF) and 34.0 percent (CES)
▪ 2025 - 38.0 percent (REF) and 41.0 percent (CES)
▪ 2030 - 46.0 percent (REF) and 50.0 percent (CES)
▪ 2035 - 56.0 percent (REF) and 58.0 percent (CES)
▪ 2040 - 61.0 percent (REF) and 64.0 percent (CES)
Renewable Energy Share 
The target increase in renewable capacity of at least 20,000 MW based on 2010 level in the REF
expands the share of RE to almost 50.0 percent of the total capacity mix in 2040. However, this 
falls short to the aspirational target of 35.0 percent share under the Renewable Portfolio Standards 
(RPS) for on-grid. In the REF, the aggregate share of renewables only reaches 33.0 percent of the 
total generation mix in 2040. 
The said target is achieved in the CES with 37.3 percent contribution to the power generation mix 
with corresponding 54.0 percent share of the capacity mix. 
Investment
The required build cost for the additional generating capacity under the REF amounts to USD 104.7 
billion of investment. With more capacity requirements in the CES, investment jumps to USD 124.0 
billion, up by 18.4 percent from the REF or an average of around USD 6.2 billion investment per 
year. More than 60.0 percent of the CES investment is allocated for the 44,761 MW of new 
renewable capacity from 2020-2040. System Cost is not estimated as part of the investment, which covers the costs on reliability and 
transmission line reinforcement, among others. This cost shall be included in the next PEP update 
together with the cost estimates on other mitigation actions and adaption strategies to come up 
with the total investment cost for the energy sector’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)
Greenhouse Gas Emission
Total GHG emission from fossil fuels (oil, coal and natural gas) increases at 6.0 percent per year 
under the REF, from 123.3 MtCO2e in 2018 to 444.5 MtCO2e in 2040. Coal accounts for half (56.9 
percent) of the total GHG emission, while oil provides a share of 39.1 percent, and natural gas with 
a 4.0 percent. Under the CES, GHG emission falls by 26.0 percent from the REF level, registering 
329.1 MtCO2e in 2040. This results from cleaner and more efficient fuels for transport, increased 
share of renewables, along with highly-efficient coal and natural gas technologies. 
II. CREATING WEALTH FOR THE FILIPINO
In compliance with the AmBisyon Natin 2040, the PEP 2018-2040 has been formulated to support 
the government’s goal of promoting inclusive growth, one in which the benefits of economic 
expansion trickles down to more Filipinos, especially those in the marginalized sector. And what 
better way is there to promote inclusive growth than through the generation of investments and 
employment opportunities for all. 
The energy sector plays an important role not only in providing uninterrupted 24/7 energy supply,
but in creating a conducive environment for long-term investments and quality jobs for Filipinos. 
As the Philippine economy reels from the crippling effect of the health pandemic, the DOE is 
forward planning by synergizing economic recovery plans with sustainable energy goals.
With the diversity of the country’s energy mix, the DOE works towards a much stronger 
environment for business investments and employment generation in terms of new, clean and 
efficient energy technologies, as well as from conventional energy sources. Realizing said 
aspiration is made possible through an innovative partnership between the government and the 
private sectors.
Summarized below are the major contributions of various energy sectors to help the country 
realize AmBisyon Natin 2040 through valuable investments and employment opportunities.
A. CLEAN ENERGY FUELS AND TECHNOLOGIES
1. RENEWABLE ENERGY
The signs of climate change remain and continue to be alarming. Thus, the DOE emphasizes its 
commitment to further accelerate RE positioning in the energy mix. As the country’s transition 
toward clean energy fuels and technologies, the sector is packed with opportunities to create 
“green energy investments and jobs.” As of end-2018, a total of 277 Renewable Energy Service 
Contracts (RESCs) were awarded with potential capacity of more than 15,109 MW. This requires an 
estimated investment of about PhP 2,062 billion, potentially creating about 10,616 green jobs 
during the planning horizon. Major contributors to the investments are from hydropower (PhP
2,040 billion), geothermal (PhP 16.7 billion), and solar (PhP5.2 billion). The geothermal energy 
sector generates the most employment opportunities at 7,000 jobs for its pre-development stage.The Competitive Renewable Energy Zones (CREZ) is another investment-generating program that 
intends to upgrade and expand transmission facilities for the optimal use of the indigenous 
renewable resources of the country. The research study conducted by the DOE and the United 
States–National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), with funding support from the United 
States Agency for International Development (USAID), shows that there are identified 25 
candidate RE zones (REZ) estimated to have gross capacity of 807 GW of RE technologies.
2. ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CONSERVATION
With the EE&C Roadmap pointing to its target of annual reduction in energy intensity and 
consumption, priority initiatives and strategies were identified for the planning horizon. These 
programs include appropriate mechanisms on energy efficiency and resilience of the power
distribution systems and facilities, implementation of the Philippine Energy Labeling Program 
(PELP), mainstreaming of EE&C at the LGU level, and Demand Side Management, among others. 
Further, the enactment of the EE&C Act, together with the approval of its Implementing Rules and 
Regulations (IRR), provides the appropriate catalyst to make EE&C a Way of Life in the Philippines
In addition to reducing energy use, EE&C measures can generate investments and create jobs that 
will foster economic growth. It may either come from the design, installation and maintenance of 
efficient energy technologies (e.g. such as the hiring of Energy Service Companies or ESCOs), from 
the manufacture and distribution of energy efficient products, as well as from the training and 
certification of energy conservation officers and managers. Currently, the country now has 23 
active ESCOs, which provide energy efficiency upgrades for various facilities/infrastructures. 
In particular, the implementation of the EE&C Act requires the hiring of Certified Energy 
Conservation Officers (CECO) for Type 1 Designated Establishments, Certified Energy Managers 
(CEM) for Type 2 Designated Establishments and Energy Auditors. Both the CECO and CEM may 
either be chosen from within the organization or through external recruitment. The certification 
system of the CECO and CEM, to be implemented by the DOE-accredited institutions necessitates 
the services of technical training specialists to conduct the training modules. 
With all policies and strategies now in place on EE&C, it may not take long for it to be considered 
as an energy resource that is equally important as other existing supply resources.
3. ALTERNATIVE FUELS AND TECHNOLOGIES
The AFETs play a critical role in the country’s quest for a low emission target especially for the 
transport sector. In fact, the use of AFETs is a critical strategy identified in the country’s NDC to 
the Paris Agreement.
As opportunities flourish in this sector, the Alternative Fuels and Technologies Roadmap was 
crafted to ensure a secured and stable supply of energy through a technology-responsive energy 
sector. The said roadmap prioritizes the use of EVs, HEVs, auto-LPG vehicles and CNG-fed vehicles. 
Other initiatives involve the development of solar-powered motorized boats, government vehicle 
re-fleeting using “Next Generation Vehicles,” prototyping of Original Engine Manufacture for AutoLPG jeepneys and the mainstreaming of Alternative Fuels Vehicle in the transport sector.
With its broad portfolio for potential innovations in the transport sector, the AFETs sector can 
generate investments and employment opportunities to boost the growth of the Philippine 
economy. It is also the sector with the biggest opportunity for research and development.The DOE’s Market Transformation through Introduction of Energy Efficient Electric Vehicles (E-Trike) 
Project was able to gain the support of 14 investors engaged in the business of electric vehicle
manufacturing, assemblers and importers with a corresponding investment of PhP562 Million 
(USD 11.3 Million @ forex rate of US=PhP49.55) and generating about 1,050 direct jobs from EV 
companies to support the creation of an electric vehicle industry in the country.
Policies providing incentives to interested investors in the AFET sector are now in place to include 
the following:
▪ EO 226 or the “Omnibus Investments Code of 1987” offers Income Tax Holiday of six years 
to a maximum of eight years for new registered pioneering firms that will engage in the 
business of EVs, Alternative Fuels Vehicles, charging stations and environment/climate 
change-related projects as well as Duty Free importation of capital equipment, spare parts 
and supplies; 
▪ EO 488 (s. 2006) modifies the rates of import duty on components, parts and accessories for 
the assembly of hybrid, electric, flexible fuel and CNG motor vehicles to zero rate, thereby 
allowing electric vehicle manufacturers to import components at a more affordable price; 
and,
▪ TRAIN Act provides tax incentives for pure EVs and hybrid vehicles
B. CONVENTIONAL ENERGY
1. OIL AND GAS
The DOE is steering its efforts towards the development of an optimal energy mix to meet its 
agenda on energy security. Specifically, the optimal energy mix requires the use of all available 
energy resources to meet the country’s energy requirements.
The Upstream Oil and Gas Roadmap is bent on increasing local petroleum reserves to 57.1 MMB of 
oil and 5.87 TCF of gas, as well as production of 114.4 MMB of oil and 4.0 TCF of gas by 2040. The 
Malampaya Deep Water Gas-to- Power Project is still the biggest source of natural gas in the 
country. It was developed and currently operated by Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. (SPEX) with 
joint venture partners, Chevron Malampaya LLC and the Philippine National Oil CompanyExploration Corporation (PNOC-EC). It is also one of the largest and significant endeavors in the 
Philippine energy sector. For the period January 2002 to June 2018, royalties collected from the 
project reached PhP 263 billi0n.
The DOE continues to offer oil and gas prospects through the Philippine Conventional Energy 
Contracting Program (PCECP). This program has two modes of awarding Service Contracts –
through the nomination process and application in pre-determined areas (PDA). As a result, the 
country may look forward to USD48.6 million once the two service contracts (SCs) recommended 
for approval under PCECP are signed by the President. Likewise, potential investment of USD 43.7 
million may come from the approval of applications received under Nominated Areas 1 and 5, and 
PDAs 6 and 7.
2. COAL
Coal remains as a reliable and affordable source of energy, producing electricity that can power up 
manufacturing and industrial plants and even residential homes.The Upstream Coal Roadmap expects that by 2040, local coal reserves reaches 766 MMMT, while 
local coal production is estimated at 282 MMMT. The projected coal production alone entails about 
PhP 609.3 billion. To achieve these targets and attract investor interest, the DOE continues to 
conduct Information, Education and Communication (IEC) campaigns and promotional activities 
Currently, there are two coal projects certified as Energy Projects of National Significance (EPNS) 
(per EO 30) which can potentially generate investments of about PhP 143 million. 
The PNOC-EC, the energy exploration arm of the government, operates Coal Operating Contract 
(COC) 41 located in Zamboanga Sibugay, which may generate PhP 4.0 billion worth of investments, 
as well as create 1,000 opportunities for employment.
C. DOWNSTREAM OIL INDUSTRY
Investment opportunities in the downstream oil industry come from business prospects on fuel 
bulk and retail marketing, LPG refilling and marketing, petroleum transport, terminalling and 
bunkering. In 2018, there are 325 industry participants with total accumulated investments of 
PhP180.8 Billion (since 1998).
In 2019, various industry players invested an additional of PhP 8,374.1 million estimated to have 
employed 753 people. Moreover, the first half of 2020 brought in PhP 1,673 million of investments 
and providing jobs to about 224 people. These were achieved through activities, such as the 
construction of new import terminal, depots and distribution/hauling of petroleum products.
On the retail marketing business,the country now has 9,381 industry players in the liquid petroleum 
product (LPP) and 297 refilling plants for the LPG industry. For 2019 alone, construction of new 
facilities employed 460 individuals contributing to the economic and social development in the 
areas where the facilities operate.
For the first quarter of 2020, two additional LPP and LPG facilities were constructed with an 
investment cost of more than PhP 50 million and provide employment to 15 individuals. 
D. DOWNSTREAM NATURAL GAS
The country is transitioning to cleaner energy sources such as natural gas. This resource is also 
efficient in producing energy to meet the country’s energy needs. The DOE crafted the Natural 
Gas Roadmap with the intent of establishing a world-class, investment-driven and efficient natural 
gas industry to make it the preferred fuel for end-use subsectors. Also, the DOE envisions the 
country as an LNG hub, which can distribute LNG not only across the country, but for export to 
other countries as well. 
On the development of LNG terminals, the DOE has approved the permits of four LNG 
Regasification Terminal Projects targeted for operation from 2022 to 2025. These projects require 
investments of PhP 64,632 million and create employment for more than 4,000 people during the 
construction stage and 325 during operation stage of the project (with preference for local experts 
in the sector). More investments are expected for other necessary natural gas infrastructure like 
satellite terminals, transmission and distribution pipelines, and refueling stations when demand 
for natural gas ramps up in the near future. E. POWER DEVELOPMENT SECTOR
Private financing and private sector participation are key drivers to push forward developments in 
the power sector. The restructuring of the power sector called for by the EPIRA has the sole intent 
of realizing a competitive and market-driven electricity sector. To support the EPIRA, Power Sector 
Roadmaps (one each per subsector) have been developed covering the business of power 
generation, transmission, distribution, missionary electrification, total electrification program, and
the reforms in the power market.
Implementation of these roadmaps is highly dependent on secured investments. To build new 
power generation plants brings in investments of about USD 104.7 billion as required under the 
Reference Scenario. The Clean Energy Scenario, which involves higher share of renewables,
necessitates around USD 124.0 billion. 
To accommodate new power generation capacities, the transmission network needs a total 
investment amounting to USD 17.9 billion for the upgrading and expansion plan to include island 
interconnection projects. Meanwhile, the distribution development projects demand about USD 
16.4 billion of investments to increase network efficiency and improve performance of distribution 
utilities (DUs). Half of the amount is allotted for electrification projects, while 40.0 percent is 
earmarked for new substations and sub-transmission facilities, and the upgrading/rehabilitation of 
existing distribution system. The remaining investment is for non-network projects like property 
acquisition, equipment, vehicles and others. 
The potential employment opportunities associated with power generation projects is estimated 
to be around 515, 881 jobs under the Reference Scenario, and 626,073 jobs in the Clean Energy
Scenario.
III. CONSUMER EMPOWERMENT
As one of DOE’s strategic directions, 
strengthening consumer welfare and 
promotion underscores the important 
role of consumers in the energy value 
chain. It asserts that every Filipino is 
“first” when it comes to the delivery 
of energy goods and services. As a 
commitment, the DOE recognizes 
that consumer empowerment can be 
realized by having a transparent, 
competitive, and rules-based energy 
market. Mindful of energy’s critical 
role as a basic need of consumers, the 
DOE engages in the formulation of 
policies and programs aimed at 
empowering and promoting 
consumer welfare.A. RENEWABLE ENERGY SECTOR
The government’s cognizance of the country as being affluent with indigenous renewable 
resources prompted actions for the aggressive push of their development and utilization. These 
actions support the energy sector’s agenda of attaining supply security in the long-term. 
Moreover, the passage of the Renewable Energy Act of 2008 (RA 9513), including the formulation 
of corresponding policy mechanisms, encouraged greater competition and promoted consumer 
welfare.
The following RE policy mechanisms are seen to have an impact on consumers:
Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS). The policy requires electric power industry participants or 
load-serving entities to source or produce a specified portion of their electricity requirements from 
eligible renewable resources. The DOE issued two Department Circulars (DC) related to the RPS -
DC 2018-08-0024 (RPS for Off-grid Areas, promulgated on 14 September 2018) and DC 2017-12-0015 (RPS 
for On-grid Areas promulgated on 30 December 2017). 
Green Energy Option Program (GEOP). The GEOP provides end-users or consumers with the option 
of choosing RE resources as their source of energy. This is clearly defined in DC 2018-07-0019 issued 
on 7 August 2018, which set the rules and procedures for proper guidance of end-users, RE 
suppliers and network service providers (NSP). 
Green Energy Auction Program (GEAP). As one of the recent policy issuances through DC 2020-07-
0017 signed on 14 July 2020, GEAP sets the framework for which the DOE shall facilitate the 
procurement of supply from renewable projects by the mandated participants. Under the RPS ongrid rules, such procurement shall be through a competitive process for compliance of the 
mandated participants with the RPS and as applicable for their long-term power supply 
requirements.
Net Metering. A consumer-based RE incentive scheme wherein the electric power generated by 
an end-user from an eligible on-site renewable generating facility and delivered to the local 
distribution grid may be used to offset electricity provided by the DUs to the end-user during the 
applicable period. The program’s purpose is to encourage end-users to participate in RE generation 
for own use.4
Serving as legal basis for its implementation is the Energy Regulatory Commission’s (ERC) 
Resolution No. 9, Series of 2013 – A Resolution Adopting the Rules Enabling the Net-Metering 
Program for Renewable Energy – approved on 27 May 2013 and became effective on 24 July 2013.
Net metering is an enabler for a consumer to freely exercise the choice of having renewable-based 
electricity generation for own-use.
A Shift on RE Perspective
The National Renewable Energy Program (NREP) 2020-2040 is set to adopt a paradigm shift on 
renewables. It categorizes the RE systems into three (3) main baskets and moves to a consumercentered use from the then grid-centered approach.
Consumer + RE Systems. This basket encourages renewable development as consumers will use it 
in agriculture, fisheries, health, and education. This also looks at the integration of battery and 
4 Section 7 of DC 2009-05-0008other energy storage systems, as well as the use of information and communications technology 
(ICT).
Consumer + RE Systems + DU. The objective is to promote investments in the Net Metering 
Program, demand-side participation schemes and distributed energy systems through innovative, 
technical, and commercial approaches. 
Consumer + RE Systems + DU + System and Market Operations. The basket aims to facilitate and 
improve compliance to the RPS, GEAP, RE Rules, GEOP and smart grid policy, among the other 
systems and policies.
B. POWER SECTOR
Uniform Bill Format (DC 2018-09-0026). Electricity is one of the fuels that consumers have an 
interface with. The usage of such is reflected in the electricity bill, a document providing 
information on the monthly electricity consumption including the corresponding fee to be settled. 
The unbundling of electricity rates under Section 36 of the EPIRA provides for greater transparency 
and enabled consumers to be more aware of how much they are paying, specifically the fees that 
go to the DUs and fees considered as “pass through” charges collected by DUs for the government 
and power generating firms.
The DOE’s promulgation of DC 2018-09-0026 titled “Adopting Framework for Uniform Monthly 
Electricity Bill Format” on 14 September 2018 furthers the promotion of consumer welfare as they 
are affected by rates and services of the DUs and electricity supply providers. The policy covers all 
entities issuing electricity bills and includes private-investor owned utilities (PIOUs), electric 
cooperatives (ECs), local government owned utilities (LGOU), entities authorized to operate within 
Economic Zones, and other entities authorized by law to distribute and/or supply electricity to endusers, such as Qualified Third Parties (QTPs) and retail electricity suppliers (RES). These entities are
directed to use a uniform bill format that reflects all corresponding charges to end-users.
The Murang Kuryente Act of 2019 or RA 11371. The President’s signing of the Murang Kuryente Act 
on 8 August 2019 denotes the provision of an additional relief to Filipino consumers. The 
corresponding IRR was subsequently approved on 25 March 2020.
The law allows for the use of Government share from the Malampaya Natural Gas Project5 as 
payment for the stranded contract cost (SCC)6 and stranded debts (SD)7 of the National Power 
Corporation (NPC). Prior to implementation, the SCC, and SD of NPC formed part of the universal 
charge (UC)8that is passed on to consumers.
For every consumer paying the passed-on charges, the ERC-approved rates for the UC-SCC and UCSD as of December 2019 were at PhP 0.1938/kWh and PhP 0.0265/kWh, respectively. With the law 
taking effect, only the UC for Missionary Electrification (ME) at PhP 0.1561/kWh and Environment and 
Watershed Rehabilitation and Management (EWRM) at PhP 0.0025/kWh are being collected from 
5
 Service Contract (SC) No. 38 operating in offshore Palawan
6 Refers to the excess of the contracted cost of electricity under eligible Independent Power Producer contracts over the actual selling price of the 
contracted energy output of such contracts in the market.
7 Refers to any unpaid financial obligations of the NPC which have not been liquidated by the proceeds from the sales and privatization of NPC assets.
8 Refers to a non-bypassable charge which shall be passed on and collected from all end-users monthly by the DU. As stated in Section 34 of RA 9136, it is 
imposed on electricity consumers for the purposes of missionary electrification, payment of SCC and SD, environmental charge for watershed 
rehabilitation and management, equalization of taxes and royalties applied to indigenous RE sources of energy vis-à-vis imported energy fuels and a 
charge to account for all forms of cross-subsidiesIt is collected monthly by NGCP and the DU based on the approval of ERCconsumers. The total ERC-approved UC rates collected in every consumer amount to PhP
0.3789/kWh.9
Suspension of the Collection of UC-Environmental Charge (EC). The temporary suspension of the 
collection of the UC-EC (PhP 0.0025/kWh) is an added benefit that consumers get to enjoy. The 
ERC in its advisory last 22 May 2020 stated the suspension of UC-EC’s collection until further notice.10 
This move comes in an opportune time as the Filipino people are currently facing an ongoing 
pandemic brought about by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Suspending the collection is 
one of the initiatives in the energy sector that aims to ease the burden shouldered by consumers. 
Apart from this, the energy sector called for the deferment of payments of electricity bills (covered 
during the imposition of community quarantine in the country).
Competitive Selection Process (CSP). The engagement of the DUs in providing the least-cost 
electricity supply significantly impacts every consumer. In 2015, the DOE issued DC 2015-06-0008
“Mandating All Utilities to Undergo Competitive Selection Process in Securing Power Supply 
Agreements (PSA).” This required all the DUs to conduct a CSP through a Third Party in the 
procurement of PSAs for their captive market.
A need was pinpointed for a more specific CSP Policy covering all the DUs in order to have a clear, 
transparent and fair supply procurement process that promotes competition and greater private 
sector participation in the provision of least-cost, reliable and adequate supply of electricity. Given 
this thrust, the DC 2018-02-0003 on “Adopting and Prescribing for the Competitive Selection Process 
in the Procurement by the Distribution Utilities of Power Supply Agreement for the Captive Market”
was issued on 1 February 2018. The policy covers the power supply contracting of all the DUs 
serving both grid and off-grid areas in the country. It also specifies the establishment of a ThirdParty Bids and Awards Committee (TPBAC) to spearhead and manage the CSP. In addition, a Joint 
TPBAC may also be established in the case of aggregated DUs. The DUs also have the option of 
engaging a Third-Party Auctioneer in lieu of the TPBAC or Joint TPBAC to conduct and manage their
CSP. It should be noted that selection process of the TPBAC or Joint TPBAC captive customer 
representatives must be submitted to the DOE for approval. 
Retail Competition and Open Access (RCOA). Compliance to the conditions set in EPIRA instigated 
the move for RCOA. It is a policy that empowers consumers to choose their electricity supplier 
thereby aiding in the reduction of electricity costs and expanding transparency in the electricity 
industry.
Its introduction on 26 June 2013 allowed electricity end-users of 1.0 MW and above to choose their 
electricity suppliers. The end-users or customers are categorized as contestable customers and are 
permitted to source their supply from RES. It also allows the use of transmission and distribution 
systems and the associated facilities subject to the payment of distribution wheeling charges duly 
approved by the ERC. There was voluntary participation at first, but by December 2016 it eventually 
transitioned to mandatory participation for customers with 1.0 MW of demand and above.
Participation of customers reverted to voluntary after the Supreme Court (SC) issued a Temporary 
Restraining Order (TRO) in February 2017. This also covered the lowering of the contestable 
customers’ threshold from 750 kW to 1 MW. In December 2018, the RCOA’s threshold was reduced 
to 500 kW to further its implementation. Further, the retail aggregation11 was intended to start 
last December 2018 subject to the issuance of relevant guidelines.

11 Allows customers in a contiguous area whose aggregate demand is not less than 500 kW to source their electricity supply requirement on a group basis 
from a licensed supplierC. DOWNSTREAM OIL INDUSTRY
Petroleum products (e.g. gasoline, diesel, kerosene, LPG, etc.) are energy fuels that affect 
everyday life of consumers as these are primarily used in the transport sector for mobility of 
people, goods, and services, as well as the residential sector
Fuel Cost Unbundling (DC 2019-05-0008). The DOE deems fuel cost unbundling as a measure to 
promote consumer welfare and increase transparency in the downstream oil industry. This view 
led to the issuance of DC 2019-05-0008 on the “Revised Guidelines for the Monitoring of Prices on the 
Sale of Petroleum Products by the Downstream Oil Industry in the Philippines,” which was signed by 
Secretary Cusi on 28 May 2019 and promulgated on 14 June 2019. The DC basically requires oil firms 
to submit reports on its disaggregated price components including details on profit margin.
The policy enforcement did not materialize as the oil firms filed a TRO. The DOE’s action was to 
refer the TRO to the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG).
Fuel Quantity and Facility and Process Standards Development. The DOE is unwavering in its efforts 
on developing and formulating standards on petroleum fuels and related products along with oil 
facilities. These standards adhere and comply with the Philippine National Standards (PNS)12 which 
are also in accordance with the Philippine Clean Air Act of 1999 (RA 8749). The Clean Air Act is an 
air quality management policy and program that aims to achieve and maintain a healthy air for 
every Filipino. The action to constantly develop fuel quality and infrastructure standards is a 
testament of ensuring consumer welfare by making available quality fuels including safe and clean 
technologies in the downstream oil market.
DOI Legislative Agenda. The DOE’s pending bills that will advance consumer welfare are Senate 
Bills Nos. 853 and 413. The former seeks to amend RA 8479 or the Downstream Oil Industry Act of 
1998 to ensure transparency in the pricing of petroleum products by oil industry players and 
determine computations or assumptions used in price adjustments to avoid unwarranted 
profiteering and safeguard consumers. The latter focuses on the monitoring and supervision of 
business operations of the LPG industry to ensure safety of the consuming public and protect 
consumer welfare.
D. ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CONSERVATION
Consumers or end-users have a responsibility when it comes to energy efficiency and conservation 
as highlighted in Section 8 of the EE&C Act. It states that “all energy end-users shall use every 
available energy resource efficiently and promote the development and utilization of new and 
alternative energy efficient technologies and systems including RE technologies and systems across 
sectors.”
The DOE is also mandated to develop the minimum energy performance (MEP) for the commercial, 
industrial and transport sectors in consultation with relevant stakeholders and guided by a costbenefit analysis, which will be done by DOE with the assistance of the National Economic and 
Development Authority (NEDA).
13
 The energy labeling for products will continue to be 
implemented and the DOE shall include all energy consuming products, devices, and equipment.14 
Currently, the household appliances covered by the program are window-type air-conditioning 
units, household refrigerators and lighting products (e.g. CFL, LFL, FCL and ballast). The labeling 
12 PNS are standards developed and promulgated by the Department of Trade and Industry – Bureau of Product Standards (DTI-BPS).
13 Section 14 of RA 11285
14 Section 15 of RA 11285program is currently characterized by the yellow label indicating the energy efficiency ratio (EER) 
and easily distinguished by the consumers when buying the specified household appliances. A new 
design for the energy labels is being proposed using “energy stars” as indicator of energy 
efficiency ratings.
E. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
The production and utilization of energy must be complemented with sustainable practices to 
minimize the impacts to the environment. A clean and healthy environment benefits all the 
populace. The DOE for its part is involved in ensuring that environmental standards are met with 
the operation of energy projects and facilities. This aligns to the sector’s strategic directions of 
promoting consumer welfare and having a low carbon future.
Stakeholders are embodied by the Multi-Partite Monitoring Team (MMT) of energy projects and 
facilities that are considered environmentally critical projects under the Philippine Environmental 
Impact Statement System (PEISS). The DOE conducts regular environmental compliance 
monitoring of energy projects and facilities to ensure social and environmental safeguards are in 
place and applied. This is carried out through the DOE’s representation in the MMT. The MMT has 
the objective of encouraging public and/or stakeholder’s participation and providing appropriate 
check and balance mechanisms in monitoring the development and implementation of projects.
F. ENERGY RESILIENCY
One of the energy sector’s identified priorities is having a system that is resilient from risks and 
vulnerabilities resulting from natural and human-induced disasters. The sector’s responsiveness 
alleviates integrity of energy infrastructures and facilities, which in turn aid in improvement in the 
delivery of services to the people or consumers.
Energy Resiliency Policy (DC 2018-01-0001). As a response to the promulgation of the Philippine 
Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010 (RA 10121), the DOE initiated the formulation 
of the Energy Resiliency Policy (ERP). The ERP serves as a guide of adopting measures that will 
enhance and ensure reliability and security of the energy system.
The DOE issued DC 2018-01-0001 on “Adoption of Energy Resiliency in the Planning and Programming 
of the Energy Sector to Mitigate Potential Impacts of Disasters” on 17 January 2018. The energy 
resiliency program’s guiding principles are: a) strengthen existing energy infrastructure; b) 
implement the build back better principle in terms of reconstruction and rehabilitations of 
damaged infrastructure; c) improve existing operational, maintenance and practices to ensure 
continuous operations and energy supply; and d) develop resiliency standards that will be used as 
basis in future construction of energy facilities.
The Task Force on Energy Resiliency (TFER) was also created through the DC and is headed by the 
DOE Undersecretary. The TFER is automatically activated if the country faces disasters. 
In 2019, the National Energy Contingency Plan (NECP) was updated with the DOE actively working 
with the Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation Inc. (PDRF). The NECP was formulated to 
address supply disruption in both oil and power. It is directed with the prioritization in the 
restoration of electricity service for installations vital to national security, allocation of petroleum 
products for critical and strategic activities and considerations of associated effects on domestic 
socio-political stability that shall be addressed immediately by concerned agencies.G. ROLE OF LGUs
The autonomy of LGUs and its role of delivering basic services is a result of the Local Government 
Code of 1991 (RA 7160). In energy development, the LGUs are partners as they have the reach to 
the locals, which are the beneficiaries of energy projects and services. In a move to hasten the 
process of energy project implementation at the local level, the DOE executed a Joint 
Memorandum Circular with the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), known as 
the LGU Energy Code. 
LGU Energy Code. The DOE and DILG’s Joint Memorandum Circular 2020-01 titled “Guidelines for 
LGUs to Facilitate the Implementation of Energy Projects” intends to attain the following: a) to 
establish, strengthen and integrate the national energy plans, programs, policies and mechanisms 
into the local development plans; b) harmonize and fast-track the implementation of EVOSS Act, 
EODB Act, EO 30 and AO 23 with the establishment of a unified and streamline permitting process; 
c) maximize benefits from energy projects to host communities; and d) implement other necessary 
energy programs and projects to spur the total development of the LGUs. 
Implementation will be through the local development committee (LDC), which needs to be 
activated by the LGUs. Correspondingly, there is a spatial aspect given that energy programs, 
policies and projects must be incorporated in the LGU’s spatial plan. In addition, consultations 
must be done by cities and municipalities with concerned stakeholders to identify upstream 
conventional and/or renewable energy resources present in their jurisdiction.
H. CONSUMER WELFARE
The DOE’s dedicated consumer welfare and promotion office (CWPO) is mandated to formulate 
and implement policies, plans and programs relative to consumer information, welfare promotion, 
empowerment, and protection.
Given that energy policies rightly put Filipino consumers first, it is imperative that consumer offices 
in the energy sector are synchronized. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) entered into by 
the DOE with the ERC on 16 October 2019 for collaborative undertakings between the DOE-CWPO 
and ERC’s Consumer Affairs Service (CAS). These include: a) data and information sharing; b) 
consumer behavior survey, studies and other researches; c) modernization and improvements; d) 
training and development; e) technological and best practices exchange; f) policy 
recommendations/formulation; g) monitoring and evaluation; and, h) harmonization of plans and 
programs. 
The EPIRA is also clear on the promotion of consumer interests as specified in Section 41. It states 
that the ERC shall handle consumer complaints and the adequate promotion of consumer interests.
The ERC has promulgated the Magna Carta for Residential Consumers as adopted in its Resolution 
on 9 June 2004.15 The basic rights of all consumers are defined in Article 4, while Article 5 specifies 
the basic obligations of the consumer. 
If a situation arises wherein the consumer has qualms on the DU’s bill or service, the consumer has 
every right to file a complaint with the DU (Article 13). The DU for its part must record and promptly 
investigate the complaint filed. Moreover, a written report on the actions taken by the DU will be 
furnished to the consumer within 15 days from the receipt of complaint. If there is still 
disagreement between the consumer and the DU, the former may file a complaint with the ERC. 
15 Amended in 2010 through ERC Resolution No
28 Series of 2010The consumer may file with the ERC provided that this has been consulted/discussed with the DU’s 
Consumer Welfare Desk (CWD) and no settlement was reached (Section 27). The ERC observes a 
procedure for the filing of consumer complaints and it is the CAS (including the Visayas and 
Mindanao field offices) that handles this.16 The ERC also has an online customer complaint 
procedure, which includes downloading and filling up of forms – consumer complaints and the 
verification and certification of non-forum shopping – and submitting these to the CAS.17
As a way forward, advancing consumer empowerment requires the DOE to look into the 
recommendations raised by energy stakeholders. Among them is the DOE’s active stance in all 
energy rate-making processes, institutionalizing consumer representation in the energy sector 
specifically on the agencies concerned, implementing price freeze that is synchronous with 
calamities/pandemic, and strengthening the DOE’s role in local price coordination councils.
IV. PHILIPPINE AGENDA WITH THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY
Strengthening our ties with other countries and international and regional groupings is an option 
to achieve the economic and energy goals. The country’s energy agenda as put forward in the 
international community can gain support through sharing of best practices, technical 
collaboration and joint undertaking, and pursuing priorities for inclusive growths and even funding 
assistance for programs and projects that need to be implemented for further improvement of the 
domestic energy landscape. 
The DOE has been active in multilateral, regional and bilateral energy cooperation where national 
interests can be set forth in the agreements and collective commitments to be reached in these 
fora. Five (5) fora are highly recognized and prioritized, namely: 
1. Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC);
2. Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN);
3. Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA);
4. United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and 
5. Free Trade Agreements (regional and bilateral) with various countries. 
These fora serve as platforms for significant discourses on collaborative efforts, policy issues and 
concerns that effect both regional and national growth. The Philippines, together with other 
economies or member states, was able to spearhead projects or co-sponsored projects or 
initiatives based on APAEC and the Energy Security Initiatives (ESI) under APEC-Energy Working 
Group’s short and long-term Plan. In October 2015, the Philippines hosting of the 12th APEC Energy 
Ministerial Meeting (EMM) held in Cebu led to the adoption of the forum’s theme “Towards an 
Energy Resilient APEC Community,” that discussed the importance of energy systems and 
infrastructure to withstand extreme natural and man-made disasters, recover and return to 
normalcy in a timely and efficient manner and to build back better. The 12th EMM resulted in the 
creation of the Energy Resiliency Task Force (ERTF), which the Philippines co-chairs with the United 
States. 
Exchanges of best practices, policies and programs, as well as researches and studies are the most 
tangible benefits of the regional and international cooperation including addressing emerging 
issues at the regional and international levels. For decades now, these fora have been part of 
16 Source: https://www.erc.gov.ph/ContentPage/111
17 Source: https://www
ercgovph/ContentPage/307strategic directions of various countries globally with the end-goal of achieving greater energy 
security and sustainability.
The DOE has been continuously collaborating with development partners like the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP), World Bank, European Union (EU), Global Environment Facility 
(GEF) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). As manifestations of 
success, the following are the key accomplishments: 
Access to Sustainable Energy Programme (ASEP). The ASEP project of EU completed a feasibility 
study (FS) on rural electrification, and installed 10,000 units Solar Homes System (SHS) and 
contracted seven (7) projects in various stages of capacity building, procurement and 
arrangements with counterpart institutions and the LGUs. It also supported the formulation of 
the IRR for the EE&C Act. 
Development for Renewable Energy Applications Mainstreaming and Market Sustainability 
(DREAMS). The DREAMS project under UNDP and GEF supported the development and passage 
of six (6) renewable policies and guidelines and established the Philippine Renewable Energy 
Market System (PREMS) to be used by the RE Registrar.
Building Low Emission Alternatives to Develop Economic Resilience and Sustainability (B-LEADERS). 
The B-LEADERS program of USAID implemented two complementary tasks:
▪ Conduct in-country capacity building on low emission development; and,
▪ Increase investment in clean energy projects.Energy goes through a series of streams or stages before it is consumed in final form by the endusers. Stages. As presented in Figure 1, the Sankey diagram1 depicts the Philippines’ energy flow 
from the primary resources to the final use. The leftmost side of the diagram shows the primary 
energy supply comprises of available energy resources – fossil fuels (oil, coal and natural gas) and 
renewable energy (geothermal, hydro, wind, solar, biomass and biofuels), which are either 
domestically produced (indigenous) or imported. Some of the indigenous coal, crude and 
condensate are being exported (represented as negative values). The remaining volume of primary 
energy resources undergoes transformation processes (i.e., oil refining and power generation) to 
produce secondary energy products, petroleum fuels and electricity. 
In the power transformation process, coal, oil and natural gas are burned producing heat to run 
the turbine that generates electricity. The heat from solar and geothermal steam are directly used 
to run the turbine, while the mechanical energy from hydropower and wind produces heat. The 
electricity produced then passes through transmission and distribution lines to reach end-users for 
final use. 
The transformation flow of oil involves the refining process where crude oil is transformed to 
petroleum products (as secondary oil products), such as gasoline, diesel, liquefied petroleum 
product (LPG), fuel oil and others that are readily used by consumers. A portion of the volume 
produced from refinery is exported or consumed for international navigation or aviation 
(represented as negative values), and stored as stocks for future use. 
Energy losses are incurred during the transformation process in power generation and oil refining,
and during the transmission and distribution for the delivery of electricity supply to the end-users. 
Power plants and refineries also have their energy own-use. The losses and plant own-use are 
represented as negative values. 
Towards the right side of the diagram is energy commodities for final consumption of different 
economic sectors namely, Household, Transport, Industrial, Services, and Agriculture, and the raw 
materials for production processes considered as non-energy use.

 Figure 1. PHILIPPINE ENERGY FLOW, Million Tons of Oil Equivalent (MTOE), 2018A. TOTAL FINAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION
The country’s Total Final Energy Consumption (TFEC) in 2018 reached 34.3 million tons of oil 
equivalent (MTOE), up by 1.3 percent from its 2017 level of 33.9 MTOE (Figure 2). Energy use in the 
transport, households and services2 sectors increased against the declines registered for the 
industry and agriculture sectors during the period. 
Transport remains the most 
energy-intensive sector, 
accounting for more than onethird (35.7 percent) of total 
energy consumption. Its 
aggregate energy demand 
reached 12.2 MTOE, 3.5 percent 
higher than its last year’s level 
(Figure 3) due to increased 
utilization of gasoline and diesel 
for road transport, as well as 
aviation turbo for domestic air 
transport. 
Household energy consumption 
contributed 27.5 percent share of the demand mix, as it posted an increase of 2.6 percent to 9.4 
MTOE during the period. On the other hand, the slowdown in production output from the 
industrial sector, particularly from energy-intensive manufacturing sub sectors, such as nonmetallic (including cement) minerals, chemical products and basic metal industries, resulted in a 
5.1 percent drop in the sector’s energy requirements to 7.5 MTOE in 2018, corresponding to a 21.9 
percent share in the TFEC. The resilient performance of the services sector, particularly hotels and 
restaurants, translated to a 6.0 percent hike as its energy consumption reached 4.7 MTOE from its 
2017 level of 4.4 MTOE, and contributing a 13.6 percent share to the 2018 demand mix. On the 
other hand, the registered production cuts in the agriculture sector caused its energy use to fall by 
as much as 14.8 percent to 439.6 thousand tons of oil equivalent (kTOE) in 2018. 
Oil products accounted for 49.3
percent share of the country’s 
TFEC, as its consumption went up 
by 3.4 percent, from last year’s 
level of 16.3 MTOE to 16.9 MTOE in 
2018 (Figure 4). Notwithstanding 
the significant fluctuations in 
prices of oil products during most 
parts of 2018 brought about by the 
implementation of the excise tax 
provision under the Tax Reform 
for Acceleration and Inclusion
(TRAIN) Act, consumption of 
gasoline and diesel, primarily for 
road transport, went up by 3.0

Figure 3. TOTAL FINAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION, By Sector Shares (Percent), 2018percent and 3.5 percent, respectively. The combined share of the said fuels was nearly 80.0 
percent of the total oil consumption. 
Consumption of biomass3for end-use applications
garnered a 21.3 percent share of the total demand in 2018, 
albeit a measly 0.5 percent growth in its consumption 
during the period. Of the 7.3 MTOE biomass consumed in 
2018, households accounted for bulk at 78.8 percent, while 
the remaining was utilized in the services and 
manufacturing sectors, particularly for sugar and food 
processing. 
Electricity came in third after oil and 
biomass and contributed a 20.7 
percent share of the TFEC in 2018 
(Figure 5). Its consumption 
increased by 6.2 percent to reach 
7.1 MTOE from last year’s 6.7 MTOE. 
Both the industrial and household 
sectors registered close to onethird shares of the total electricity 
consumption, while 29.1 percent 
was used in the services sector.
The consumption of coal for enduse applications registered a 
decline of 19.8 percent from its 
previous year’s level of 3.0 MTOE to 
2.4 MTOE in 2018. This was brought 
about by merger of the two (2) firms’ local cement producers, Lafarge Republic Inc. and Holcim 
Philippines Inc., and the surged in imported cement that contributed to the reduction in local 
cement production during the year. 
The utilization of biofuels, coco 
methyl ester (CME) and ethanol, went 
up by 2.9 percent with combined 
levels reached 524.0 kTOE in 2018, 
from 509.2 kTOE in 2017. The 
increasing trend in biofuels 
consumption is attributed to 
compliance of oil companies with the 
biofuel blend rate as mandated under 
the Biofuels Law of 2006 or Republic 
Act (RA) 9367.

percent) to energy consumption -
increasing by 3.4 percent from its 2017 
level.
Close to two-thirds (63.2 percent) of 
the country’s energy consumption in 
2018 was for the movement of goods

Figure 5. TOTAL FINAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION, By Fuel Shares (Percent), 2018
*end-use applicationsNatural gas use for end-use applications jumped by as much as 13.1 percent in 2018, despite its 
meager share of 0.2 percent of the TFEC. The recorded increase was due to Pilipinas Shell 
Petroleum Corporation (PSPC)’s high gas off-take on top of using LPG to fuel its turbine and 
furnaces throughout the year. 
Total Final Energy Consumption, by Sector
1. TRANSPORT
The transport sector remained the major
user of energy in 2018 with a total share of 
35.7 percent in the final energy demand. Its 
consumption reached 12.2 MTOE during 
the period, 3.5 percent higher than its yearago level of 11.8 MTOE.
The energy utilized for road transport 
went up by 4.1 percent as the number of 
registered vehicles stood at 11.6 million (as 
of December 2018), up by 11.4 percent from 
10.4 million in the previous year.4 The high 
volume of motor vehicles vis-à-vis other 
transport modes likewise contributed to 
the 87.9 percent share of the road 
transport to the sector’s aggregate 
consumption (Figure 6). The fuel consumption for water transport decreased by 23.6 percent from 
265.4 kTOE in 2017 to 202.8 kTOE in 2018 and contributed 1.7 percent share of the total transport 
demand. Domestic air transport, owning a 4.8 percent share in the sector’s energy demand, went 
up by 14.0 percent to 583.6 kTOE in 2018 from the previous year’s 511.9 kTOE. The renewed 
development and promotion of local tourism and cheaper fare offerings by the Philippine Airlines 
and the Cebu Pacific and other local airlines contributed to the increase. 
Energy consumption for rail transport 
decreased by 8.4 percent in 2018 from 
the 2017 level of 11.8 kTOE. Such decline 
was a result of reduction in operating 
hours and running stock of the Metro 
Rail Transit Line 3 (MRT3) caused by
maintenance checks, as well as glitches 
and breakdowns recorded by the 
Department of Transportation (DOTr) 
for this period. Oil products continued 
to be the sector’s primary fuel, 
representing a bulk share of 96.0 
percent to the total energy demand of 
the sector during the period (Figure 7).

Figure 6. TRANSPORT FINAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION, 
 By Sub-sector Shares (Percent), 2018
Figure 7. TRANSPORT FINAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION, By Fuel 
Shares (Percent), 2018Diesel and gasoline, mainly utilized for road transport, registered an aggregate share of 89.5 
percent of the sector’s overall demand mix. In terms of growth rate, gasoline and diesel increased 
by 3.1 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively. Following the same trend, the usage of bioethanol and 
biodiesel went up by 3.1 percent and 3.2 percent, 
respectively. Fuel oil consumption decreased by 23.6 
percent during the period, mostly consumed for water 
transport. The declining number of auto-LPG taxi units 
contributed to the 3.6 percent reduction in the sector’s 
LPG consumption. 
2. HOUSEHOLDS
Aggregate energy consumption of the 
households posted a sluggish 2.6 
percent growth from its 2017 level of 
9.2 MTOE to 9.4 MTOE in 2018. 
Consumption of biomass for end-use 
applications accounted for two-thirds 
(60.9 percent) of the sector’s energy 
demand mix, as households in most 
rural areas still prefer fuelwood and 
charcoal for cooking and heating 
purposes, owing to its abundance, 
accessibility and affordability (Figure 
8). Despite its share, consumption of 
biomass posted a measly 0.3 percent 
growth from its year-ago level of 5.7 
MTOE. 
Household electricity consumption, which accounted for 25.8 percent share of the sector’s energy 
demand, increased to 2.4 MTOE in 2018 from 2.3 MTOE in 2017. With 95.3 percent household 
electrification level5 and an increase in household income6 due to lower income tax rates as 
provided under the TRAIN Law in 2018, electricity demand increased by 5.5 percent during the 
period. Also, the relatively stable LPG prices and the convenience associated with its use as 
cooking and heating fuel vis-a-vis traditional biomass contributed to the 8.6 percent increase in 
household LPG consumption during the period
3. INDUSTRY 
The Industry sector, the third largest energy consumer after the transport and household sectors, 
posted an energy demand level of 7.5 MTOE in 2018, down by 5.1 percent than a year-ago level of 
7.9 MTOE.

transport energy consumption.
Figure 8. HOUSEHOLD FINAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION, By Fuel 
Shares (Percent), 2018
*end-use applicationsThe decline stemmed from the 5.0 
percent reduction in aggregate energy 
consumption of all manufacturing 
sectors as production output of energyintensive sectors, particularly chemical 
and cement, slowed down in 2018. The 
manufacturing sub sector accounted for 
the biggest share of 92.7 percent (Figure 
9), out of which energy-intensive7
industries took 79.6 percent of the 
subsector’s total energy demand. With a 
share of 3.9 percent, the mining 
subsector’s energy consumption fell by 
10.9 percent in 2018 as the majority of 
mineral commodities, particularly nickel, 
reported declining output from closure 
of several mining pits8, as well as the 
doubling of excise taxes imposed on 
mining firms9. Similarly, the construction sub sector posted a 0.2 percent drop in its energy 
consumption due to efficient energy use by companies during the period. 
Coal, electricity, oil products and biomass10 are the 
major fuels for industrial processes (Figure 10). As coal 
garnered a 32.0 percent share of the demand mix of 
the sector, the 19.8 percent decrease in its 
consumption was the major contributor to the drop in 
the industry sector’s energy use in 2018. The decline in 
coal utilization was brought by slowdown in domestic 
production of cement due to increased importation, as well as the merger of two local cement 
plants (Lafarge and Holcim) and the closure of one of Holcim’s cement plant in Mabini, Batangas. 
Electricity, as the second most 
important fuel of the sector, 
accounted for 31.5 percent share of 
the total sector’s demand with a 
utilization level of 2.4 MTOE, an 
increase of 7.9 percent from 2017 to 
2018. 
Aggregate consumption of oil 
products reached 1.5 MTOE, 
equivalent to 19.5 percent share of the 
industry’s energy demand in 2018. 
Diesel and LPG were the most 
consumed among oil products, with a 
combined growth rate of 6.4 percent.

*end-use applicationsand sugar production accounted for a 15.9 percent share ofthe total demand recroded at1.2 MTOE, 
1.5 percent higher than a year-ago level. On the other hand, a minimal demand for natural gas (59.4 
kTOE) for non-power applications and biodiesel (13.4 kTOE) was likewise recorded during the 
period and contributed a combined share of 1.0 percent in the demand mix of the sector. 
4. SERVICES 12
As the major contributor to the country’s 
GDP growth in 2018, the 
services/commercial (trade and services) 
sector’s 6.0 percent increase in economic 
output was translated to 4.7 MTOE of 
energy consumed during the same year. 
The sector exhibited upward trend of 6.0 
percent from its 2017 level of 4.4 MTOE 
(Figure 11). 
Oil products accounted for close to half of 
the sector’s total energy demand, as the
consumption went up by 7.2 percent 
reaching 2.2 MTOE in 2018 from the 
previous year’s level of 2.1 MTOE. Diesel 
registered consumption level of 1.6 
MTOE, 12.3 percent more than its 2017 
level of 1.4 MTOE while accounting for 33.6 percent share of the sector’s demand mix. Biodiesel 
usage exhibited the same growth trend as that of diesel, as it posted a double-digit hike of 10.2 
percent to reach 30.4 kTOE during the same period. Consumption of LPG, primarily used as 
cooking fuel in restaurants and other establishments engaged in the food services business, was 
4.7 percent lower in 2018 as compared with its 2017 level of 531.7 kTOE. The sector’s demand for 
fuel oil improved by 1.4 percent from its 2017 level of 145.9 kTOE to 147.9 kTOE in 2018.
Electricity supplied 44.2 percent of the total energy demand of the sector. Its level increased to 
2.2 MTOE in 2018, higher by 5.5 percent than it’s a year-ago consumption of 2.0 MTOE. Service 
establishments slightly increase their biomass consumption by 1.5 percent, an increase from 345.0 
kTOE in 2017 to 350.2 kTOE in 2018.
5. AGRICULTURE 
The agriculture sector posted the 
biggest downturn in energy utilization 
among sectors, as its levels went down 
by 14.8 percent to 439.6 MTOE in 2018 
from 515.6 kTOE in 2017 (Table 1). 
The level of energy requirements for 
the crop production significantly 
declined by 15.7 percent due to waning 
production of major crops during the 
4
th quarter of 2018, such as palay, 
sugarcane and cassava, brought about

Figure 12. AGRICULTURE FINAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION, By Fuel 
Shares (Percent), 2018by typhoons and inadequate irrigation water. The energy consumption of the livestock and poultry 
sub sector went up by 4.8 percent in 2018 due to sustained demand from meat processors, hotel 
and restaurant industries (HRIs) and households coupled with a higher average live weight of 
marketable hogs and higher farmgate prices. 
The fishery sub sector registered 199.1 kTOE of energy, 24.1 percent lower from the previous level 
of consumption as output was largely reduced due to rough seas, strong winds, high fuel prices, 
the encroachment of commercial fishing vessels and lesser appearance of the species in the fishing 
ground were reported in Davao Region.
13
 Similarly, the forestry sub sector registered lower 
consumption of 1.0 kTOE in 2018 from 6.6 kTOE in 2017 as a result of widespread logging tagged as 
the culprit for continued deforestation in the country.
Aggregate consumption of oil products recorded at 208.0 kTOE, a reduction of 28.3 percent (Figure 
12) from previous year’s level, and accounted for 47.3 percent of the sector’s total energy 
consumption. Roughly, all oil products recorded a downtrend caused by increasing prices. Diesel, 
being the most consumed fuel in the sector, registered a significant reduction of 26.1 percent with 
200 kTOE level of consumption in 2018 from 270.4 kTOE in 2017. Similarly, gasoline and fuel oil 
consumption likewise declined by 41.0 percent and 90.8 percent, respectively. Electricity 
compensated for the decline in the consumption of other fuels as it posted steady growth of 3.5 
percent during the same period. 
B. TRANSFORMATION
1. OIL REFINING 
For the year 2018, refining output reached 86.6 million barrels (MMB), up by 12.2 percent from 77.2 
MMB in 2017. With two existing oil refineries, the Petron Bataan Refinery in Limay, Bataan and the 
Pilipinas Shell Oil Refinery located in Tabangao, Batangas City that have a combined maximum 
working crude distillation capacity of 285.2 thousand barrels per stream day (MBSD), refinery 
throughput jumped by 12.7 percent from 9.7 MTOE in 2017 to 10.9 MTOE in 2018 (Figure 13). Rising 
domestic demand for oil products resulted in higher utilization rate of the refineries.

Total 515.62 439.55 -14.75The total marketable products for the period were composed of diesel (40.9 percent share), 
gasoline (23.7 percent share) and fuel oil (6.5 percent share). The rest of the products were aviation 
fuel (9.4 percent), LPG (5.0 percent), kerosene (0.4 percent), and naphtha and other products (14.1 
percent).
2. POWER GENERATION
Power generation output increased by 5.7 percent from 94.4 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2017 to 99.8 
TWh in 2018. About half of the country’s power generation requirement was sourced from coal 
(52.1 percent), while natural gas and geothermal provided 21.4 percent and 10.5 percent shares, 
respectively, to the total power generation.
The total fuel requirements for power generation 
grew by 5.5 percent in 2018, which stood at 29.7 
MTOE. Fossil fuels contributed more than half of the 
total fuel input (60.0 percent), mainly due to 
increased share of coal in power generation to offset 
the reduction in generation output from hydropower 
plants. Consequently, the demand for renewable 
energy (RE) as input to power generation increased by less than 1.0 percent (0.6 percent) in 2018, 
pulled up by combined inputs from wind and solar to power generation. 
Coal demand (fuel input) for power generation reached 13.8 MTOE in 2018 from 12.3 MTOE in 2017. 
This level yielded a total generation output of 51.9 TWh, 10.9 percent higher than the 2017 level of 
46.8 TWh (Figure 14). Natural gas continued to contribute a significant share in the total power 
mix, a 3.8 percent increase in generation output equivalent to 21.3 TWh, with fuel input
requirement of 3.3 MTOE in 2018. Oil still plays an important role in augmenting the supply of 
electricity, particularly during peak demand. However, oil only accounted for the lowest 
contribution among the fossil fuel sources for power generation at 3.2 percent share of the total 
power mix, as oil-fired power plants experienced a 16.2 percent decline in generation output during 
the same period. This was likewise reflected in the 24.6 percent reduction of oil demand as fuel 
input in power generation.

Shares), 2017 vs -2018
Self-sufficiency in power generation 
dropped by 2.8 percentage points to 51.0 
percent in 2018 due to increased usage of 
imported coal in power plants. B. TOTAL PRIMARY ENERGY SUPPLY (TPES)
The country’s TPES reached 59.7 MTOE, 
up by 2.9 percent from its 2017 level of 
58.0 MTOE, with an increase 4.6 percent 
in energy net imports from 28.4 MTOE in 
2017 to 29.7 MTOE in 2018. Energy
imports compensated the sluggish 1.4 
percent aggregate growth in indigenous 
energy brought about by contraction in 
production/yield of oil (-4.5 percent), 
hydro (-2.4 percent), and coal (-1.5 
percent). As a result, the 2018 selfsufficiency level, expressed as the ratio 
of total indigenous energy to total 
primary supply, was lower by 0.7 
percentage points from 50.9 percent in 
2017 to 50.2 percent in 2018 (Figure 15). 
Oil continued to be the country’s major 
source of supply. It accounts for about 
one- third (33.5 percent) of the TPES, 
followed by coal and geothermal, which 
contributed 27.4 percent and 15.0
percent share, respectively. In 2018, 
natural gas supply grew fastest at a rate 
of 11.6 percent, while coal supply rose by 
5.7 percent from increased importation. From the intensified programs that promote reliable and 
sustainable renewable resources, the aggregate supply of renewable energy went up by 0.6 
percentto 19.7 MTOE, representing more than a third (34.1 percent) of the TPES. Notable increases 
were reported in the combined levels of wind and solar (4.7 percent growth), biofuels (2.9 percent
growth) and geothermal (1.6 percent growth) during the same period. 
1. INDIGENOUS ENERGY
Total indigenous energy production was slightly higher by 1.4 percent from 29.5 MTOE in 2017 to 
29.9 MTOE in 2018. Increased domestic production was reported for biofuels (13.4 percent), natural 
gas (11.6 percent), wind (5.4 percent), solar (4.0 percent) and biomass14 (0.2 percent). In terms of 
contribution to total domestic production, geothermal accounted for 30.0 percent share, biomass 
with 25.6 percent), coal with 20.7 percent, and natural gas with 12.0 percent. Total indigenous 
resources accounted for 50.2 percent of the country’s total energy supply in 2018. 
a. Fossil Fuels
i. Oil. Aggregate domestic oil production, including condensate, declined by 4.5 percent, from 
621.8 kTOE in 2017 to 593.8 kTOE in 2018, while its contribution to the total indigenous 
energy supply stood at 2.0 percent share. The reduction was a result of lower production 
output reported in Nido, Matinloc and Galoc fields during the same period.

Figure 15. TOTAL PRIMARY ENERGY MIX, By Fuel Shares (Percent), 
2017 vs. 2018ii. Coal. Indigenous coal supply, with a share of 20.7 percent of the total domestic energy 
production, fell by 1.5 percent to 6.2 MTOE in 2018 from 6.3 MTOE in the previous year. The 
Semirara Mining and Power Corporation (SMPC), the country’s major coal producer, 
accounts for a 99.0 percent share of the total local coal production of the country. The 
SMPC’s 2018 production reached 6.2 MTOE, 1.5 percent lower vis-a-vis its 2017 level.
Aggregate production of private coal mines in Cebu, with a marginal combined share of 0.1 
percent to the total domestic production, decreased at a rate of 45.0 percent compared 
with its 2017 level of 6.3 MTOE. Meanwhile, coal mines in Bicol, Surigao, Zamboanga and 
small-scale mines located in some parts of the country, with a combined contribution of 0.8 
percent share of coal production, registered improved operations as reflected by 17.5 
percent growth in production levels from 2017. 
iii. Natural Gas. In 2018, natural gas production stood at 3.6 MTOE, translated to a 12.0 percent 
share of the total indigenous supply. Natural gas production from Malampaya, the 
country’s single source of natural gas, was up by 11.6 percent compared with the 2017 level 
of 3.2 MTOE. Effective platform operation resulting in zero maintenance activity greatly 
contributed to the increase in supply level. 
b. Renewable Energy
i. Geothermal. The share of geothermal energy 
of the total indigenous energy supply reached 
30.0 percent in 2018, equivalent to 15.0
percent share to the TPES, as its level was 1.6 
percent higher at 9.0 MTOE compared with 
the 2017 level of 8.8 MTOE. The installed generating capacity of geothermal power plants 
increased by 1.5 percent from the previous year’s level. 
ii. Hydro. The country’s hydropower production in 2018 contributed 7.8 percent share to the 
total indigenous energy supply or a 3.9 percent share to the TPES. It posted a 2.4 percent 
decline to 2.3 MTOE in 2018 as power generation output went down. The reduction was 
associated with variation in water availability caused by below normal rainfall conditions 
that signaled the onset of the El Niño phenomenon in the later months of 2018. 
iii. Solar. The total power generation output from solar grew by 4.0 percent from its 2017 level 
of 103.3 kTOE to 107.4 kTOE level in 2018, but only accounted for a 0.4 percent share of the 
total indigenous energy (and 0.2 percent TPES) in 2018. Solar installed capacity rose from 
884 MW in 2017 to 895 MW in 2018, as solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are increasingly 
becoming popular. 
iv. Wind. Production of wind energy stood at 99.1 KTOE, 5.4 percent more than its 2017 level 
of 94.0 kTOE, albeit a marginal contribution of 0.3 percent to the indigenous energy 
production. 
v. Biomass. Biomass supply,
15 both for power and non-power applications, continued to 
account for around one-fourth (25.6 percent) of the indigenous energy supply in 2018. Its 
levelreached 7.7 MTOE in 2018, slightly higher by 0.2 percent from its 2017 level of 7.7 MTOE. 
15 Includes charcoal
fuelwoodrice hullbagasseagricultureanimal and municipal wastes
With 80.0 percent share, natural gas and 
renewable energy continue to dominate 
domestic energy supply.The bulk of the biomass supply was used for non-power applications,16 while biomass for 
power, including municipal wastes as feedstock, reached 373.8 MTOE in 2018. 
vi. Biofuels. The country’s aggregate biofuels (biodiesel and bioethanol) domestic supply 
recorded a 13.4 percent growth, from 298.0 kTOE in 2017 to 337.9 kTOE in 2018, 
corresponding to a 1.1 percent combined share to the total indigenous energy for the same 
period. Bioethanol production grew by 29.3 percent from 131.3 kTOE in 2017 to 169.8 kTOE 
in 2018. The 12 existing ethanol facilities yielded total sales of 303.7 million liters in 2018. On 
biodiesel, the 11 existing producers put in a combined sales of about 205.2 million liters in 
2018, translating to a supply level of 168.1 kTOE, up by 0.8 percent from the 2017 level. 
2. NET ENERGY IMPORTS17
Net energy imports reached 29.7 
MTOE in 2018, 4.6 percent higher
from its year-ago level of 28.4 
MTOE, and with a 49.8 percent 
share out of the country’s TPES. 
Of the total net imports, oil and oil 
products accounted for nearly twothirds (65.2 percent), while coal 
contributed 34.1 percent, and 
biofuels with less than 1.0 percent 
share. The bulk of the increase was 
due to higher net coal importation,
as levels went up by 10.5 percent from 9.2 MTOE in 2017 to 10.1 MTOE in 2018 (Figure 16). 
Oil imports comprised 48.5 percent crudes and 51.5 percent oil products. Despite the higher crude 
oil prices and weakened value of the peso vis-à-vis dollar during the year,18 the volume of imported 
crude increased by 10.5 percent reaching 11.5 MTOE in 2018 from its previous year’s 10.4 MTOE. The 
Middle East continues to be the major source of the country’s imported crude at 87.0 percent 
share, while other countries in the Asia-Pacific region19 supplied the rest of country’s total crude 
oil importation. Higher crude imports contributed to the increase in refinery output to provide for 
rising domestic demand for oil, particularly in the transport sector, as the aggregate volume of 
imported finished oil products slightly went down by 0.5 percent to 12.2 MTOE in 2018, from 12.3
MTOE in 2017. China, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Singapore are the major 
sources of imported oil products with shares of 30.2 percent, 28.8 percent, 8.7 percent and 8.1 
percent, respectively. These countries are also the top export markets of the Philippines. 
Exports of finished oil products went up by 15.3 percent to 1.6 MTOE in 2018, from the previous 
year’s 1.4 MTOE. Crude oil exports from the Galoc field have been declining for three (3) 
consecutive years, posting a 24.3 percent reduction in 2018. Meanwhile, exports of condensate 
from Malampaya was 3.8 percent higher than its 2017 level of 408.6 kTOE. 
16 Biomass demand from the households, servicesl and industry sector was 7.3 MTOE in 2018. This includes charcoal, fuelwood, rice hull, bagasse, agriculture 
and animal waste
17 This is derived as total primary energy supply (TPES) less indigenous production. Alternatively, it can also be calculated as the sum of imports and stock 
change (+/-) less exports and international bunkers (aviation and marine)

Figure 16. NET ENERGY IMPORTS, By Fuel Shares (Percent), 2018Coal importation increased by 18.1 percent in 2018, as 
volume reached 13.9 MTOE in 2018 vis-à-vis 11.8 MTOE 
in 2017. This was mainly due to higher demand for coal 
as fuel input in power generation. Indonesia maintains 
its position as the country’s prime coal importer with 
a share of 88.5 percent, while the remaining portion 
was supplied by Australia, Vietnam, Russia and South 
Korea. 
Coal exports were down by 18.1 percent to 2.7 MTOE in 2018 from its 2017 volume of 3.3 MTOE. 
China, the country’s top export market (97.8 percent share) for locally produced coal, recorded a 
13.5 percent drop in its demand to 4.9 MMT during the period. However, higher requirement for 
domestic coal was also noted from emerging export markets such as Thailand and India. 
Ethanol imports went down by 6.0 percent to reach 144.7 kTOE, from its 2017 level of 154.0 kTOE. 
This was consistent with the requirements for the bioethanol-blended as the gasoline import also 
dropped for this particular period.
C. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
Between 2017 and 2018, total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from energy-related activities 
increased by 4.1 percent, which stood at 123.3 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) 
in 2018 from 118.5 MtCO2e the previous year. The increased activities in all sectors contributed to 
the rise in GHG, notably in the power generation and transport, as both are major sectors that 
supported the robust economic growth during the period. The GHG emission from power 
generation grew the fastest at 9.5 percent and contributing the largest share in the total GHG 
emission, from 49.2 percent share in 2017 to 51.7 percent share in 2018 (Table 2).
Aside from the power generation sector, GHG emissions from the transport and industry sectors 
contributed 27.9 percent and 11.3 percent, respectively, of total. The rest came from other sectors 
such as agriculture and services/commercial (8.5 percent share), and other energy sector’s 
activities (e.g. oil refining) (0.6 percent share). The considerable increase in GHG emission is mainly

Figure 17 and Table 4 show the avoidance vis-a-vis mitigation measures in the energy sector. For 
2018, the combined impact of the demand-side mitigation measures, i.e., efficient use of fossil fuel 
and electricity, biofuels blend and natural gas contributed 11.0 MtCO2e net GHG reductions, 
bringing down the GHG emission level by 7.9 percent from the total hypothetical GHG emission 
(actual plus total avoidance). The fuel diversification in power generation through the use of 
renewables and natural gas contributed 3.5 percent (of the hypothetical GHG emission) further 
reduction in GHG emission during the same period. With the above-stated mitigation measures, 
the energy sector has avoided a total of 15.8 MtCO2e or 11.4 percent GHG emission reduction in 
2018. This level translates to an 8.6 percent improvement from avoidance level of 14.6 MtCO2e in 
2017.
Note: Hypothetical GHG Emission is equivalent to Actual GHG Emission plus GHG Emission Avoidance; GHG Base year is CY 2000

The country’s total economic output, measured in terms 
of real gross domestic product (GDP), posted a slower 
growth of 6.2 percent in 2018 vis-à-vis 6.7 percent in 2017 
as prices of basic commodities significantly increased due 
to new or higher excise taxes on consumption and food 
supply concerns. The Services sector,21 with a 57.8 percent 
share of real GDP, remains the major contributor to GDP 
growth. Despite the slightly weakened performance of domestic trade and other services sub 
sectors, including banks, insurance and real estate, the sector’s aggregate value-added managed 
to sustain its 6.8 percent in 2018 buoyed by the double-digit growth in government services. 
Growth in the Industry sector, with a share of 34.1 percent of GDP, exhibited a slower 6.7 percent
growth as a result of the slump in manufacturing output despite the robust 14.9 percent expansion 
in the construction sub sector. The Agriculture sector, which had the least contribution to GDP at 
8.1 percent share, posted a sluggish 0.9 percent increase in gross value added (GVA) as the 
production of major crops and the fisheries sub sectors contracted during the same period. On the 
demand side, the slowdown in consumer spending due to inflation was compensated by increased 
government spending, particularly on infrastructure, and higher capital investments on durable 
equipment and intellectual property products (primarily on software and knowledge materials).
1. ENERGY INTENSITY
The country’s economy-wide energy intensity level 
reached 6.4 tonnes of oil equivalent per million 
pesos of real GDP (TOE/MPhp) in 2018, lower by 
3.4 percent than the 6.7 TOE/MPhP in 2017. 
Similarly, oil intensity dropped by 5.0 percent to 1.7 
barrel per PhP100,000 (bbl/100k PhP), while 
electricity intensity was 0.5 percent lower at 10.8 
watt-hour per peso (Wh/PhP). Reduction in the

Improving efforts in energy efficiency across 
all economic sectors contributed to the 3.4 
percent reduction in energy intensity to 6.4 
tonnes of oil equivalent per million pesos of 
real GDP in 2018. 
The Services sector, including the 
energy-intensive Transport sector, 
continue to drive the country’s 
economic growth. country’s energy intensity can be attributed to improving efforts in energy efficiency across all 
economic sectors. 
All sectors registered a decline in their respective energy intensities. The industry sector’s energy 
intensity dropped by 6.11 percent to 1.8 TOE/MPhp in 2018 as the reduced production output, 
particularly in the manufacturing sub sector, translated to less energy consumed. Likewise, the 
agriculture sector level of energy intensity went down by 9.9 percent, albeit being the lowest at 
0.1 TOE/MPhp, as the sector’s energy consumption for crop production and fisheries decreased.
The services sector posted an energy intensity level of 2.6 TOE/MPhp, a slight reduction of 1.8 
percent than its year-ago level from efficiency gains that slowed down the energy consumption of 
commercial establishments in 2018. Meanwhile, household energy intensity also went down by 2.4 
percent to 1.9 TOE/MPhp during the same year. 
2. ENERGY ELASTICITY
Energy elasticity with reference to GDP is 
the percentage change in energy demand22
for every perc entage change in GDP. In 
2018, energy-to-GDP elasticity was reported 
at 0.4, while oil consumption to GDP 
elasticity registered a 0.1 elastcity. Both 
posted lower elasticity from 2017 levels 
indicating that the volume of overall energy 
consumption (and oil consumption) 
became less responsive to economic 
output, that is higher growth in GDP 
translated to lower growth in energy 
consumption. On electricity, higher 
elasticity of 0.9 was registered, which 
implied that more electricity was utilized with respect to economic output (Figure 18). 
3. ENERGY PER CAPITA 
Energy per capita level was only up by 1.0 
percent to 0.56 TOE/person in 2018 from last 
year’s 0.55 TOE/person. Electricity per capita 
posted 4.1 percent growth from the previous 
year’s level to reach 936 kWh/person, while 
oil per capita registered 1.46 barrel/person, 
but 0.7 percent lower than its 2017 level. 
Improved energy and electricity per capita 
levels in 2018 reflected increased access to 
energy services due to the extensive efforts 
of the government and stakeholders in the 
energy sector. The slight drop in oil per 
capita can be attributed to the slower 
consumption caused by increasing domestic 
oil prices during the year (Figure 19).
22 TPED or total primary energy demand
Energy elasticity measures the responviveness of TFED to a change in GDP
Figure 19. ENERGY PER CAPITA, 2017 vs. 2018
Figure 18. ENERGY ELASTICITIES, 2017 vs. 20184. GHG EMISSION 
For 2018, total GHG emission for 
every PhP 100,000 of GDP stood at 
1.34 tons of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e), 
2.0 percent lower than the previous 
year’s level of 1.37 tCO2e (Figure 20). 
Tapered activities of all end-use 
sectors required less energy, 
particularly the industry sector, led 
to a decrease in aggregate GHG 
emission levels by 14.5 percent 
during the period in review. 
With fossil fuels’ 62 percent share in 
the energy mix, the GHG emission per TPES was 2.07 tCO2e/TOE, 1.2 percent more than its 2017 level 
of 2.04 tCO2e/TOE, while GHG emission per TOE of oil consumption was registered at 2.48 tCO2e in 
2018. As generation output of coal-fired power plants increased vis-à-vis output from renewable 
energy power plants in 2018, GHG emission per megawatt-hr (MWh) of electricity generation went 
up by 3.6 percent to 0.64 tCO2e in the same period. Given the trend in fossil fuel levels, GHG per 
capita reflected a 2.7 percent increase, which stood at 1.16 tCO2e/person in 2018 from 1.13 
tCO2e/person a year ago.
E. LEAST COST TO CONSUMERS
1. ASSESSMENT OF BASIC ENERGY SERVICES
i. Gasoline and Diesel
Gasoline and diesel are the most widely used oil products, accounting for 13.2 percent and 26.0 
percent, respectively, of the country’s TFEC in 2018. These fuels are primarily utilized for 
transport, while other sectors consume them as fuel for production machineries and 
generators, among others. 
The TRAIN Law or of the Republi Act No. 10963 brings new excise tax schemes that also affected 
oil-based products. Diesel, previously with no excise tax, was imposed with Php2.50/liter,
23
while gasoline with Php7.00/liter24 for the first tranche effective 01 January 2018. These new 
excise taxes pushed up domestic pump prices of gasoline and diesel by as much as Php 
11.92/liter for gasoline and Php 14.91/liter for diesel in June 2018 (Table 5).
Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec
Gasoline 3.57 4.78 6.80 9.50 11.59 11.92 11.30 10.70 11.35 12.91 6.47 1.32
Diesel 8.09 9.86 9.96 11.28 13.08 14.91 13.84 11.87 12.83 13.83 8.76 2.19
Despite price hikes, consumption of gasoline and diesel was still higher by 3.0 percent and 3.5 
percent, respectively, in 2018. These trends point to inelasticity demand of gasoline and diesel 
against price (Figure 21), which means that consumption of these fuels do not respond 
23 PhP 4.50/liter for second tranche effective 01 January 2019, and PhP 6.00 for the third and last transche effective 01 January 2020. 
24 PhP 9
00/liter for for second tranche and PhP 1000 for the third and last tranche
Table 5. INCREASES IN THE MONTHLY AVERAGE PUMP PRICES OF GASOLINE AND DIESEL (PhP/Liter), 2017 vs. 2018
Figure 20. ENVIRONMENTAL EMISSION INDICATORS, 2017 vs. 2018proportionately to changes in prices 
since they have no direct substitutes. 
This is particularly true for 
transportation and other grass-roots 
level groups (farmers, etc.). 
Domestic pump prices of gasoline and 
diesel have fuel cost components, 
namely import cost and domestic 
biofuels cost. Import cost, also called 
peso landed cost (PLC), is pegged to the 
Mean of Platts Singapore (MOPS) for 
gasoline, diesel and imported ethanol. Fluctuations in peso-dollar exchange rates as well as in 
the Dubai benchmark price of crude oil are likely to impact import costs. Local biofuels costs
follow the pricing index set by the Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) and prevailing local 
CME prices, and is dictated by feedstock availability. The existing blend schedule is 10.0 percent 
ethanol for gasoline and 2.0 percent CME for diesel. The tax costs include the expanded Value 
Added Tax (e-VAT) or final goods tax, currently at 12.0 percent, and the new excise taxes as 
discussed above. Completing the cost components are industry take and other costs. 
Figure 22 shows the average shares of these cost components based on weekly pump prices of 
gasoline and diesel in 2017 and 2018. On the average, fuel costs accounted for more than 50.0 
– 60.0 percent of the pump prices. For diesel, the fuel cost was around two-thirds of its punp 
price as compared with gasoline since its global prices are more costly due to the higher cost of 
production. 
The share of taxes in pump price increased by around 5.0 percentage points between 2017 and 
2018, with gasoline having higher tax than diesel under the TRAIN Law. With an increase in 
taxes, other costs share declined for both fuels in 2018. It also noted that the share of other 
costs for gasoline tends to be higher than that of diesel since the latter has a lower mark-up 
owing to its use for mass transportation and in other sectors that directly impact the price of 
basic commodities. 
ii. Electricity
Electricity accounted for 19.9 percent of the country’s TFEC in 2018. As electricity is widely 
consumed, any increase in electricity rates affect the consumers. Monthly electricity power 
rates for January 2017 to December 2018 are shown in Figure 23.
Gasoline Diesel
Figure 22. COST COMPONENTS (% SHARE) FOR GASOLINE AND DIESEL, 2017 vs. 2018
Figure 21. PRICE ELASTICITY OF GASOLINE AND DIESEL, 2017 vs. 2018On the average, electricity rates 
stood at PhP 7.12/kWh for the 
industrial customer, while 
commercial and residential class 
rates at PhP 8.38/kwh and PhP 
9.85/kWh, respectively. Notably,
higher electricity rates in March 
to May or during the summer 
season in 2017 and 2018 were
associated with high usage of 
electricity for cooling due to high 
temperature and humidity 
resulting in increased peak 
demand.
25
The industrial class rate is the cheapest among customer classes due to lower distrbution cost 
since customers can be supplied with a larger amount of electricity using high voltage lines or 
the sub-transmission asset (138 kilovolt/kV or 69 kV line) for large industrial customers, making 
delivery of electricity cheaper. In the case of small industrial customers, commerical and 
residential, different voltage levels are required, from high voltage transmission and 
distribution lines (138 kV or 69 kV) down to primary level of 13.8 kV (commercial and small 
industry customer) and low voltage or secondary level of 220 volt (residential). Further, the 
distribution utilities (DUs) need to install electrical meter and other attendant electrical wirings 
per household connection, which necessitate more manpower, time and effort to deliver the 
services.
Manila Electric Company (Meralco), the largest private sector distribution utility company in the 
Philippines which covers much of Luzon, servicing 36 cities and 75 municipalities, charges its
customers based on the above customer rate classification. The approved rate schedule set by 
the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) is unbundled showing the cost components as 
follows: 
▪ Generation charge covers the biggest share in the electricity bill; it is a pass-through 
charge which means the money goes straight to the power suppliers where the 
distribution utility sourced its power;
▪ Transmission charge is the cost that goes to National Grid Corporation of the Philippines 
(NGCP) for transporting power from generator to the substations;
▪ Distribution charge goes to the distribution utility for the delivery of power to the 
customers;
▪ Government taxes comprise value-added tax, energy tax, and local franchise tax; and,
▪ Others include feed-in-tariff allowance, subsidies, system loss and universal charge.
Figure 24 shows the average share of each cost component of unbundled rate per customer of 
the Meralco franchise for 2017 and 2018. For the Residential classification, generation 
component was about 45.0 percent of the electricity rate followed by distribution with 25.0 
percent, while government taxes and transmission charges were at 9.4 percent and 7.6 percent, 
respectively. 
25 During peak demand
flexible generation plants such as oil and other peaking plants with high generation costs are used to supply electricity
Figure 23. MONTHLY ELECTRICITY RATES PER CUSTOMER (PhP/kWh), 2017- 2018Under Commercial classification, the average share of generation charge was at 57.0 percent
of the electricity rate. The distribution component was less than 15 percent, while the 
transmission component was at 10.o percent. In Industrial classification, the generation charge 
was two-thirds of the electricity rate, on average, but the share of distribution component was 
lower at 8.5 percent compared with residential and commercial classifications. Transmission 
component was at almost the same level as in commercial classification with 9.5 percent share 
of the electricity rate. 
The generation and distribution charges accounted for the biggest chunk of the electricity rate 
with an aggregate share of almost three-fourths of the bill, on average, as shown in Table 6.
The industrial class’ generation charge got the highest share in its bill at 63.9 percent (2017) and 
66.6 percent (2018) as compared with commercial and residential customers. Transmission 
cost of industrial customers was higher than distribution cost as sub-transmission assets were 
utilized more for large industries.

 *Residential customers consuming 100 kWh or less per month.
The residential class displayed the highest cost on distribution for using more distribution 
facilities and manpower services than the other customer classes, about 27.0 percent in 2017 
and 24.4 percent in 2018 of the electricity bill. And since residential customers are connected to 
lower voltage, losses are high than the large industrial customers. Electricity losses are inversely 
proportional to the voltage level of the line, such that the high voltage lines have lower losses 
compared with lower voltage lines carrying the same amount of power26. Further, electricity 
passes to longer transmission and distribution lines that result in more losses aside from the 
cases of pilferage by some customers.

Figure 24. AVERAGE SHARE (%) OF COST COMPONENTS OF THE ELECTRICITY RATE PER CUSTOMER, 2017-2018A subsidy is levied as part of the electricity rate, of which the fund is allocated to subsidize 
residential customers consuming 100 kWh or less per month. The subsidy component in the 
residential electricity rate is always negative reflecting the amount of subsidy already given to 
such type of residential customers, which stood at almost 2.0 percent of the residential class’
electricity bill and 1.0 percent for commercial and industrial classes, on average. 
A Universal Charge (UC) has been included in the electricity bills of all customer classes, 
accounting for an average share of 4.0-5.0 percent. The UC collected from sales of electricity is 
used for, among others, missionary electrification, environmental support (specifically for 
watershed rehabilitation and management), and, to pay for the stranded debts and stranded 
contract costs of the National Power Corporation (NPC). The UC for missionary electrification 
is allotted for the electrification of remote and unviable areas, as well as areas not connected 
to the grid. 
The Feed-in-Tariff Allowance (Fit-All) in the electricity rate is an additional tariff paid for power 
generation from renewables imposed on consumers of electricity to help renewable energy 
developers recover their costs. In term of government tax, the industrial class received the 
lowest tax level with an average of 4.3 percent of the electricity bill, while the residential class 
levied with highest tax. 
Table 7 shows the schedule of new excise tax on fuels used for power generation under the 
TRAIN Law. From a previously zero excise tax each for diesel and fuel oil, a PhP 2.50 per liter 
was imposed effective 01 January 2018, and increased to PhP 4.50 in 2019 and PhP 6.0 in 2020. 
However, the tax shall be suspended when the average Dubai crude oil price based on Mean of 
Platts Singapore (MOPS) for three months prior to the scheduled increase breaches USD
80.0/barrel. Meanwhile, tax on domestic and imported coal per metric ton went up to PhP 50.0
in 2018, PhP 100 in 2019 and PhP 150.0 in 2020.

2. POLICY TOWARDS UNBUNDLING 
The unbundling policy in electricity tariff is one of the successful missions implemented under 
Section 36 of RA 9136 or the Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA) of 2001 which took effect 
last June 26, 2001. It aims to promote transparency for the consumers to know the components 
of the electricity rates and paves the way for greater accountability in the power industry. It also 
provides information for the decision-maker to evaluate which of the components need to be 
reduced to achieve a lower cost.

address the clamor of the consumer for oil price hikes. Even in a deregulated scheme, the 
Department of Energy (DOE) underscores the need for oil companies to unbundle fuel prices by 
indicating in detail how price adjustments are formulated and computed for greater transparency 
and to avoid anti-competitive behavior among the players.
3. COMPARATIVE ELECTRICITY RATES AMONG ASEAN COUNTRIES
Among the ASEAN Member States (AMS), the Philippines has the second-highest average 
electricity rate in the region next to Cambodia29. On a per customer classification, the Philippines
charges the highest electricity rate both for the residential and commercial classes attributed to 
the absence of subsidy compared with other AMS (Figure 25). The Philippines electricity rates cover
government taxes and other fees as presented in Figure 24 and Table 6. 
With highly subsidized energy prices for over 20 years, Brunei Darussalam has the lowest electricity 
tariff in the region. The price of gas delivered to the Department of Electrical Department (DES) 
and Berakas Power Company (BPC) gas power stations are lower than the market price. Brunei is 
energy self-sufficient and a net energy exporter with its vast domestically available oil and natural 
gas. Other AMS providing subsidies are Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Malaysia and Indonesia 
are also energy net exporters. Malaysia has abundant natural gas and crude oil resources, while 
Indonesia is a net exporter of coal. Thailand relies on energy imports, accounting for more than 
half of its energy supply. 
One of the factors that makes the electricity tariff in the Philippines higher than the other AMS is 
the imposition of the value-added tax (VAT), which is now at 12.0 percent. Based on the study 
conducted by the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) titled “Comparative 
Analysis of Power Prices in the Philippines and Selected ASEAN Countries30,” the country has the 
highest VAT imposed on electricity than Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Malaysia levies the 
lowest VAT at 6.0 percent introduced in April 2015, a reduction from previously 8.0 percent VAT. 
Thailand enforces a 7.0 VAT, which was supposed to be increased to 10.o percent in October 2016,
but the government did not push through with the proposed hike. Indonesia applies a 10.0 VAT, a

Figure 25. ELECTRICITY RATES IN ASEAN COUNTRIES in USD/kWh, August 2020raise from 2.0 percent. The cost of capital (weighted average cost of capital or WACC) in the 
Philippines is also a contributing factor, which is 3.0-8.0 percent higher than the others. Lower 
thermal efficiency, specifically for coal power plants, likewise adds to the cost of electricity in the 
Philippines. 
According to the ERIA study, in spite of the efforts to lower electricity tariff in the Philippines, the 
tariff level remains high. The cost structure of the country’s power distribution/retail companies 
shows that the power generation comprises the largest portion of the electricity cost at around 
50.0 percent of the electricity bill. And to improve the standard of living and industry
competitiveness, further cost reduction, particularly in the power generation sector, is needed by 
lowering the WACC and improving thermal efficiency of power plants. The regulatory frameworks31
now in place address the concern on WACC with streamlined and reduced processes in securing 
permits and licenses for the development of energy projects, thus reducing the transaction costs. 
The thermal efficiency of the power plants is being dealt with through the implementation of the 
Performance Assessment and Audit (PAA) to evaluate the performance and efficiency of power 
facilities.
4. STRATEGIC DIRECTIONS
i. Energy Self-Sufficiency
The Philippines is known to be heavily 
dependent on imported fossil fuels, 
particularly coal and oil. Mindful of 
the resulting impact of continued 
reliance on energy imports, the DOE 
pursued the attainment of a 
sustainable 60.0 percent energy selfsufficiency beyond 2010 as outlined in 
its 2007-2014 Philippine Energy Plan 
(PEP) Update. The achievement of 
such target was anchored on the 
effective implementation of plans and 
programs that were aimed at: (a) accelerating the exploration, development and utilization of 
indigenous energy resources; (b) intensifying renewable energy resource development; (c) 
increasing the use of alternative fuels; and, (d) enhancing energy efficiency and conservation.
32
Figure 26 shows the trend of energy self-sufficiency, or the ratio of indigenous energy resources 
to total energy supply, for the last 10 years.
31 Energy Virtual One Stop Shop Act or EVOSS, Executive Order 30, Ease of Doing Business Act, Administrative Order 30, and the LGU Energy Code. Please see 
Chapter II of this Plan. 
32 2007-2014 Philippine Energy Plan (PEP) Update
Figure 26. ENERGY SELF-SUFFICIENCY (Percent) , 2008 - 2018From 2009 to 2012, the 
implementation of the abovestated programs resulted in 
sustained energy self-sufficiency of 
more than 60 percent. During this 
period, the share of renewables to 
the TPES ranged from 43.0 percent 
to 45.0 percent, combined with 
increasing levels of indigenous 
fossil fuels (oil, coal and natural 
gas) (Figure 27). After 2012, 
renewable share was on a 
downtrend, as levels registered 
dismal growths. This was 
attributable to the declining utilization of biomass for end-use applications, intermittency of 
geothermal and hydro (prone to shifts in climate/temperatures), the continuing reliance on coal 
power plants as baseload for power generation, which utilized higher coal grades being 
imported from Indonesia, and increasing use of imported oil for the transport sector. Coupled 
with the steady levels of domestic resources, declining shares of renewables contributed to the 
further reduction in energy self-sufficiency. In 2018, energy self-sufficiency stood at 50.2 
percent, 10.0 percentage points away from the target set forth in 2007. The indigenous fossil 
fuels were not able to compensate for the decline in renewables that led to the reduction in
self-sufficiency, hence, an increased energy importation. 
ii. Job Creation 
Under the AmBisyon Natin 2040 and the Philippine Development Plan 2017-2020, about 1.3 
million to 1.5 million jobs are expected to be created every year for two decades. The energy 
sector is one of the sectors that can potentially contribute to job generation with oil and 
electricity remaining to be the most utilized fuels to support the growing economy. 
In 2018, electricity demand registered a 20.7 percent share to the TFEC, while power supply 
generated a total of 99.8 TWh. The total installed generating capacity in 2018 reached 23,815
MW, of which 1,087 MW capacities were new additions from the 2017 installed capacity of 
22,728.

Figure 27. FUEL SHARES (Percent) TO TPES, 2008- 2018Among the power plant types, the coal-fired power plant is the most labor-intensive during the 
construction and installation period or requiring almost 2,000 manpower. Geothermal and 
hydroelectric power plants are those with the highest employment generated among the 
renewable power plants. 
A total of 910 additional jobs were generated for the operations and maintenance of the power 
plants in 2018, the bulk of which were employed in coal plants. With the additional capacity of 
in 2018, the power sector contributed an estimated 5,050 additional jobs, about half was from 
coal-fired power plants (Table 8). 
iii. Investments
The DOE formulates the PEP 2018-2040 to support the governent’s AmBisyon Natin 2040. This 
vision represents a 25-year collective aspirations of the Filipinos especially those in the 
marginalized sector, for themselves and the country. That is, to have a more stable and 
comfortable lifestyle, and sense of security knowing that they can provide enough for their daily 
needs.
In support of this inclusive growth, the energy sector plays an important role in job creation by 
creating investment opportunities for the sector. The technology-neutral approach of the DOE 
opens the door to a diversity of options for the possible investors in the country. This in return 
can lead to an increase in job opportunities for the Filipinos. 
Renewable Energy
The renewable energy’s target of 20,000 MW capacity by 2040 balances the energy mix for 
environmentally sustainable energy. This target will potentially offer green energy investment 
and green jobs for the country. To encourage prospective investors, the Renewable Energy Act 
of 2008 provides the following policy mechanisms:
▪ Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) for On-grid and Off-grid;
▪ Green Energy Option Program (GEOP);
▪ Competitive Renewable Energy Zones (CREZ);
▪ Renewable Energy Trust Fund (RETF);
▪ Omnibus Guidelines governing the awarding and administration of RE contracts and 
registration of RE developers;
▪ Renewable Energy Market (REM) Rules;
▪ Duty-Free importation and monitoring of the utilization of RE machinery
▪ Operating Permits to RE Suppliers under the GEOP
▪ Green Energy Auction Program (GEAP)
The promulgation of Energy Virtual One-Stop Shop (EVOSS) or RA 11234 and Executive Order 
(EO) 30, creating the Energy Investment Coordinating Council (EICC), intend to improve 
transparency and shorten the processing of the required permits/clearances/certificates for 
energy projects. With harmonized and streamlined regulatory procedure now in place, 
potential investors are encouraged to venture in energy projects in any of the energy sub 
sectors, thereby creating greater investment and job opportunities for the country.Alternative Fuels and Technologies (AFETs)
The utilization of Alternative Fuels and Technologies (AFETs) is widely supported due to its role 
in lessening carbon emission of the transport sector. As a result, investment opportunities 
flourish in this sector guided by the Alternative Fuels and Technologies Roadmap that prioritizes 
the use of electric vehicles (EVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), auto-LPG vehicles, and 
compressed natural gas (CNG) fed vehicles. 
These AFETs have potential to generate investment and job opportunities with its extensive 
portfolio of innovations. From 2016-2019, the 14 firms engaged in EV manufacturing, assembly 
and importers provided an initial investment of nearly USD 11.3 million and generated around 
1,000 job. The Electric Vehicles Association of the Philippines (EVAP) has envisioned to produce 
around 9,000 units of EVs from 2019 to 2021. 
The policies that can further increase investment interests in the AFET include: providing an 
income tax holiday through the Omnibus Investments Code of 1987; modification of rates of 
import duty on parts, components and other accessories under EO 488; and, the TRAIN Law 
which provides excise tax exemption and discount to pure EVs and HEVs.
Downstream Industry
The downstream oil industry reached a total of Php6,593.7 million from the expansion projects 
of import terminals in Regions 3 and 4A which translated to more than 300 jobs. New depots 
constructed in Pampanga and General Santos City in Mindanao and the transport facilities 
engaged in the distribution and hauling also poured in investment and job opportunities. The 
stable business environment in retail marketing likewise continues to bring in investments for 
the LPG industry.
To tap clean energy, investment opportunities are seen to grow in the downstream Natural Gas 
industry. Public-private partnerships of the government enables greater private sector 
participation. The approval of the development of the four Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)
Regasification Terminals requires a total investment of PhP64,632 million that could generate 
more than 4,000 jobs for host communities in the country.
Power Development
The steady increase in electricity demand driven by economic growth requires huge investment 
in the power sector. The transition of the power sector structure enables it to have more 
competitive supply markets as the opportunities were opened to the investors in financing 
power projects. Further, the transmission and distribution systems need to maintain efficiency 
and reliability of the power network to improve and ensure reliable service to the consumer.A. MACROECONOMIC AND ENERGY TARGETS
1. Macroeconomic Targets
The Energy Outlook considers 
growth targets aligned with 
the AmBisyon Natin 2040 and 
the Philippine Development 
Plan 2017-2022. The country’s 
gross domestic product 
(GDP) is expecting to reach its 
momentum at 8.4 percent 
expansion by 2030, and 
moving towards 7.4 percent 
growth by 2040. The Outlook 
also uses the population 
growth rate projections of 
the Philippine Statistics 
Authority (PSA), which 
assumes a 0.84 percent 
growth for 2035-2040.
The basis for the oil price assumptions is the World Oil Outlook (WOO) 2016-2040 of the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), a proxy for international oil prices. OPEC 
expects crude oil prices to register at USD 80/barrel in 2020 to USD 123/barrel by 2030, and more 
than USD 160/barrel by 2040.
2. Energy Demand-Side and Production Targets
The Energy Outlook takes into account the targets and assumptions as shown in Table 9 for 
simulation of two (2) scenarios – the Reference Scenario (REF) or the Business-as-Usual and the 
Clean Energy Scenario (CES) as an alternative. The Outlook likewise incorporates the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation’s (APEC) aspirational target to reduce aggregate energy intensity by 25.0 
percent in 2030 to 45.0 percent by 2035 with 2005 as the base year period, as well as the ASEAN 
 
TARGETS UNDER AMBISYON NATIN 2040 AND 
THE PHILIPPINE DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2017-2022 
(NEDA) Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation (APAEC) 2016-2025 target reduction in energy intensity of 
20.0 percent by 2020 and 30.0 percent33 by 2025.
B. TOTAL FINAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION 
Total final energy 
consumption (TFEC) under 
the Reference Scenario 
increases at an average rate 
of 4.8 percent annually 
from its 2018 level of 34.3 
million tons of oil 
equivalent (MTOE) to 96.7 
MTOE in 2040 (Figure 28). 
The transport sector 
remains the most energyintensive sector with more 
than one-third (38.4 
percent) share of the TFEC 
over the planning horizon. 
The Industry gets around a 
fourth (24.3 percent average share34) of the TFEC. Both sectors contribute significantly to the

Figure 28. TOTAL FINAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION, By Sector (MTOE), 2000-2040increase in the TFEC levels from 
2018 to 2040. The household sector 
accounts for 21.9 percent average 
share of the TFEC, followed by the 
services35 sector with a 13.7 percent 
share. The Agriculture sector 
continues to have the least share at 
1.6 percent of the TFEC (Figure 29).
Modernization in the Agriculture 
sector pushes its energy 
requirement to exhibit the fastest 
growth at 6.6 percent a year. While 
the robust growth in the Industry 
sector, supported by the 
government programs to unlock the potential development of the country’s manufacturing 
sector, triggers its energy use to increase by 5.9 percent annually in the planning period. As the 
business environment improves and contributes to the services sector’s role as the main driver of 
the domestic economy expansion, its energy consumption 
posts a yearly increment of 5.1 percent. The transport and 
household sectors register average annual increments of 5.1 
percent and 3.1 percent, respectively. 
1. TOTAL FINAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION BY FUEL
Oil products account for more than half (52.9 percent) of the 
TFEC (Figure 30). Notwithstanding the steady increase in oil 
prices in the international market, demand for oil products 
increases by an average of 5.2 percent per year between 2018 
to 2040. A combined share of diesel and gasoline stands at 
74.6 percent of the total oil demand. Oil products are primarily 
used for transport, as the sector accounts for more than twothirds (69.6 percent) of the total oil demand for the entire 
planning period. 
35 Excluding transportation
Demand increases at an 
average rate of 4.8 percent 
annually from its 2018 level of

Shares (Percent), 2018-2040
Figure 30. FINAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION, By Fuel Shares (Percent), 
Average for 2018-2040Next to oil products, electricity 
contributes an average share of 
25.5 percent of the TFEC, while 
its demand increases by 6.7 
percent annually (Figure 31). 
With the scheduled expansion 
plans of existing mass rail 
systems, electricity use in the 
transport sector reaches 302 
kTOE in 2040, translating to an 
average annual increase of 17.3 
percent from its 9 kTOE in 2018. 
The industry and residential 
sector constitute the largest 
portion of electricity demand 
with a combined average share 
of 67.1 percent across the planning period. 
Improvement in standards of living coupled with a 
greater preference for energy-efficiency technologies as 
a result of rising income reduces the consumption of 
biomass36 for end-use applications in the TFEC to sluggish 
growth of 0.3 percent between 2018 and 2040. However, 
it remains the third most consumed fuel next to oil and
electricity with a 13.5 percent average share to the TFEC within the planning period. For household 
consumption, biomass for end-use application continues to figure in the demand mix as it reaches 
4.9 MTOE in 2040, albeit declining at an average rate of 0.7 percent from its 2018 level of 5.7 MTOE. 
But there remains a significant biomass consumption in the sugar manufacturing sub sector, as 
well as in commercial establishments.
Coal consumption for end-use applications expands by 4.4 percent a year, with an average share 
of 6.3 percent of the TFEC. Its consumption rises from 2.4 MTOE in 2018 to 6.2 MTOE in 2040. Coal 
is the major fuel in the cement and basic metals industry – primary building materials for public and 
private construction projects. 
Implementation of the mandated blend schedule for bioethanol and biodiesel pushes the total 
biofuels demand from 0.5 MTOE in 2018 to 1.1 MTOE in 2040. This translates to a 4.6 percent and 
5.4 percent increase in the demand for biodiesel and bioethanol, respectively. 
Consumption of natural gas for end-use applications grows measly at 0.4 percent a year, equivalent 
to 65 KTOE in 2040, as the industry sector only manages to sustain its demand across the planning 
period.

a. Transport
The government’s Build, Build, Build Infrastructure Program 
plans to roll out a total of 75 flagship projects worth at least PhP 
2.18 trillion by 2022. The country’s transport network will benefit 
from the construction of three (3) bus rapid transits, four (4) 
seaports, six (6) airports, nine (9) railways and 31 roads and 
bridges that would help bring down the costs of production, 
improve rural incomes, encourage countryside investments, 
make the movement of goods and people more efficient, and 
create more jobs .
These anticipated major upgrades in the road, railway and port 
systems increase the energy requirement of the transport sector 
with an annual rate of 5.1 percent to reach 36.2 MTOE in 2040, 
translating to 37.5 percent share of the TFEC during the same 
year. The bulk of the sector’s energy demand is for road 
transport, as it accounts for about 80.0 percent of domestic 
traffic and 60.0 percent of freight traffic. Oil remains the sector’s 
primary fuel with a hefty share of 95.8 percent of the sector’s 
total energy requirement across the planning period.
Aggressive market promotions and availability of flexible 
financing schemes together with rising incomes and the 
government’s Comprehensive Automotive Resurgence Strategy (CARS) will sustain vehicle sales 
over the planning horizon. These serve as the impetus behind the 5.2 percent and 4.5 percent 
average growth in gasoline and diesel demand, translating to an aggregate share of 86.0 percent 
of the sector’s total oil demand. Combined consumption for these major fuels rises to 30.6 MTOE 
in 2040 from 11.0 MTOE in 2018 (Figure 32).

sector within the planning horizon:
▪ Biofuels demand expands by an 
average rate of 5.2 percent 
between 2018 and 2040 due to 
the DOE’s continuous monitoring 
of the strict compliance of the oil 
companies with the mandated 
biofuel blend. Bioethanol and 
biodiesel consumption grows by 
5.4 percent and 4.6 percent per year, respectively, and displaces part of the consumption for 
both gasoline and diesel across the planning period. 
▪ Electricity demand escalates to 302 kTOE by 2040 in line with the expansion plans of existing 
mass and light railway systems. 
b. Households
With the number of households rising to 
around 35 million by 2040, aggregate 
energy consumption nearly doubles 
from the 2018 level of 9.4 MTOE to 18.3 
MTOE in 2040, posting a yearly 
increment of 3.1 percent across the 
planning horizon. The rise in household 
incomes from expected economic 
expansion, improved employment 
opportunities and declining income tax 
rates contribute to the shift in the 
sector’s preference towards more 
efficient fuels, such as electricity and

and manufactured by Toyota. Japan donated 45 units under its Non-Project Grant Aid to 
the Philippines for the procurement and delivery of next generation vehicles (i.e. hybrid 
vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and electric vehicles) (Source: DOE)
TOWNHOUSES WITH SOLAR ROOFTOPS. Solar installed rooftops are gaining 
popularity among households that seek to minimize their electricity bills (Source: 
Solaric Corporation Philippines)LPG. This effectively reduces the sector’s demand for conventional fuels, such as biomass and 
kerosene (Figure 33).
As household usage of biomass37 for end-use 
applications declines by 0.7 percent a year due to fuel 
switching, its share to the sector’s total energy 
consumption drops by more than 30 percentage points 
from its 60.9 percent share in 2018, as the level reaches 4.9 MTOE by 2040. 
Achievement of the 
government’s 100 
percent household 
electrification target by 
2022 is a major 
contributing factor in 
more than a four-fold 
rise in electricity 
demand to 10.0 MTOE in 
2040, from 2.4 MTOE in 
2018. This translates to 
6.6 percent growth a 
year. Household 
consumption of LPG 
exhibits the same 
pattern of increase, albeit, slower at 4.8 percent growth per year. The shift towards electricity and 
LPG, as the preferred fuel for cooking and heating owing to their convenient use in homes and 
other residential dwellings, contributes to the 4.0 percent average yearly reduction in kerosene 
between 2018 and 2040.

c. Industry
The Industry sector contributes to economic 
growth and employment in the long-run as backed 
by effective implementation of the government’s 
Manufacturing Resurgence Program. The said 
program envisions a globally competitive 
manufacturing industry serving as the regional and international production hub of automotive, 
electronics, garments and food supported by well-managed supply chains. These programs

Manufacturing Resurgence Program (MRP)
pushes energy use of the Industry sector to 
increase more than thrice its 2018 level to 26 
MTOE by 2040.
As incomes improve, households double 
their energy consumption by 2040. 
Figure 33. HOUSEHOLD FINAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION, By Fuel (MTOE), 2000-2040increase energy use for industrial 
processes by more than three-fold from 
its 2018 level of 7.5 MTOE to 26.3 MTOE in 
2040, translating to an average annual 
growth rate of 5.9 percent, while 
contributing an average share of 24.3 
percent in the country’s TFEC (Figure 34).
Electricity becomes the major fuel for 
industrial processes, taking up an 
average share of 34.4 percent of the 
sector’s total energy demand for 
machinery/equipment and basic metal 
production, textile/apparel and other 
food production uses. From its 2018 level 
of 2.4 MTOE, the total electricity 
consumption of the sector grows by 6.6 
percent average per year, reaching 9.7 
MTOE in 2040.
The industry remains the major end-user of coal, as the fuel accounts for an average share of 26.2 
percent of the sector’s energy demand. Cement, petrochemical and basic metals sub sectors 
register increasing coal consumption as these industries serve as the backbone of rapid 
infrastructure developments in succeeding years for both the public and private sectors. Demand 
for coal of other manufacturing industries, such as paper production and beverages, will also 
increase across the planning horizon. With these, aggregate coal consumption in the sector 
expands by an average rate of 4.4 percent per year, while doubling up its 2018 level of 2.5 MTOE to 
6.2 MTOE by 2040.
Aside from coal and 
electricity, oil is still an 
important fuel for 
production processes 
with an average share of 
26.1 percent of the 
industry’s energy 
demand mix. Its level 
will reach 8.1 MTOE by 
2040 from 1.5 MTOE in 
2018, equivalent to an 
average yearly 
increment of 8.8 
percent. Among oil 
products, diesel and fuel 
oil constitute around 80.0 percent of the sector’s oil demand with an average yearly increase of 
7.0 percent and 8.4 percent, respectively. LPG consumption also rises significantly at an average 
rate of 10.1 percent a year to meet the increased requirements of food processing and other 
industries.

To guarantee sufficient energy for its production processes, industries are likely to tap other 
energy sources, such as biomass. Thus, biomass38 for end-use applications remains in the sector’s 
demand mix with an average share of 12.6 percent. Biomass consumption, particularly for sugar 
production, food and other manufacturing industries, stands at 2.2 MTOE by 2040. Consumption 
of natural gas for industrial purposes increases steadily to 65 kTOE in the same year.
d. Services (Excluding Transport) 
The policy measures by the government to 
attract more foreign direct investments, such 
as limiting constraints in doing business to cut 
red tape and liberalize business practices 
further support the expansion in the 
commercial/services sector. These policies will 
sustain the growth of trade, financial
intermediation, real estate and other business 
activities, including business process 
outsourcing (BPO) and information technology. 
As such, the aggregate energy requirement of 
commercial establishments increases at an 
average rate of 5.1 percent – from 4.7 MTOE in 
2018 to 14.1 MTOE in 2040.
Electricity is the main source of fuel of the 
sector, as it accounts for over a half (54.2 
percent) of its total energy demand. Increased use of electricity for lighting and cooling 
requirements of the rising number of commercial/service establishments, particularly hotels, office 
spaces, banks, and other services, drives up the demand level to 8.6 MTOE by 2040, more than four 
times higher than the 2018 level (2.1 MTOE), while posting an annual increment of 6.7 percent 
throughout the planning period (Figure 35).

(Source: EDGE Buildings Facebook page)Consumption of oil products, primarily used by 
establishments engaged in food, accommodation 
and other related services, registers yearly 
increment of 3.5 percent. LPG, fuel oil, and diesel 
increase annually by 5.3 percent, 8.3 percent and 1.8 
percent, respectively. 
Correspondingly, 
biodiesel demand also 
rises reaching 46 kTOE in 
2040. The sustained 
biomass demand for enduse applications from 
food establishments and 
restaurants, mainly used 
for cooking and heating, 
contributes to steady 
growth of 3.2 percent a 
year, from 345 kTOE in 
2018 to 695 kTOE. 
e. Agriculture
Despite being the least energy user, 
the energy demand of the 
Agriculture sector grows annually at 
6.6 percent reaching 1.8 MTOE in 
2040 (Table 14). Electricity, primarily 
used in livestock and poultry 
subsectors, accounts for more than 
half (51.5 percent) of the sector’s 
energy demand. Its consumption 
stands at 969 kTOE by 2040, 
increasing at an average of 6.8 
percent per year from 228 kTOE in 
2018.

Modernization and mechanization of the PH agriculture sector, including improvement 
of technology and logistics, is aimed at reducing post-harvest losses and ensure 
increased productivity. (Source: PIA/DA)The anticipated modernization of the 
agriculture sector expands the share of 
electricity in the sector’s demand mix as more 
agricultural types of machinery and 
technologies using electricity are made 
available to farmers. On the other hand, the 
aggregate consumption of oil products takes 
47.6 percent of the sector’s energy consumption, exhibiting a slightly slower growth rate at 6.3 
percent. Diesel consumption for farm equipment, crop production and fishery escalates to 765 
kTOE by 2040, representing the bulk of the sector’s oil demand. As a result, biodiesel demand 
registers 15 kTOE by 2040. 
3. IMPACT OF CLEAN ENERGY SCENARIO TO TOTAL FINAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION 
 
Incorporating the energy demand assumptions under the CES results in slower growth of the TFEC 
at 4.4 percent a year. The CES requires 87.7 MTOE, 9.3 percent lower than the REF. Of the 9.0 
MTOE reduction in energy demand between the two scenarios, the transport sector contributes 
the largest share at 63.7 percent or 5.7 MTOE (Figure 36). 
Fuel diversification and improvements in vehicle efficiencies and standards in the transport sector, 
as well as the expected savings in the consumption of oil products, result in a 14.8 percent 
reduction in oil demand reaching 43.9 MTOE by 2040 vis-à-vis 51.5 MTOE under REF. Consequently, 
oil’s share drops to 50.0 percent in the CES from its 53.2 percent share in the REF for the same year.

Increasing population vis-à-vis per capita 
consumption on food pushes the Agriculture
sector energy demand to increase by four-fold 
despite being the lowest user.
Figure 36. REFERENCE vs. CLEAN ENERGY SCENARIO, By Sector (MTOE), 2040Electricity displaces part of oil consumption in the transport sector under the CES, expanding its 
share to 32.3 percent from 30.5 percent in the REF, despite aggregate levels being 4.0 percent 
lower due to electricity savings in other end-use sectors (Figure 37).
Contributing to the drop in oil consumption in the CES are the 
10.0 percent increase in the penetration rate of electric 
vehicles (EVs) and full operation of the expanded and 
modernized railway systems: Light Rail Transit (LRT) Line 1 
(Baclaran – Cavite), LRT Line 2 East (Masinag), LRT 2 West 
(Recto-Pier); Metro Rail Transit (MRT) 7 and Metro Manila 
Subway Phase 1; PNR North-South Commuter Railway (ClarkMalolos-Manila-Calamba), PNR South Long Haul (Manila-Bicol) 
and Subic-Clark Railway; Cebu Metro Rail System; and, the 
Mindanao Rail Network. 
These infrastructure projects, covering a total of 1,900 
kilometers of railway systems that aim to benefit around 4.5 
million passengers per day, effectively contribute to transport 
modal shift, resulting in a lesser dependence on oil for road 
transport. Likewise, the availability of buses running on 
compressed natural gas (CNG) allocates around 12 kTOE 
consumption for transport.
How the Policies under the Clean 
Energy Shifts Energy Demand 
towards Cleaner Fuels?
Clean energy policies 
contribute to 14.8 percent 
reduction in oil demand vis-àvis Reference. 
Oil consumption in the 
transport sector drops by 21.0
percent due to combined 
effects of fuel diversification, 
improvements in vehicle 
efficiencies and standards and 
10.0 percent penetration of 
electric vehicles by 2040. 
Natural gas consumption 
increases by 4.0 percent 
between 2018 and 2040, as 
commercial and transport 
increase their demand in 
addition to industry. 
Energy savings of 5.0 for oil and 
electricity by 2040 slow down 
the growth of the TFEC at 4.4 
percent a year.
Figure 37. REFERENCE vs. CLEAN ENERGY SCENARIO, By Fuel (MTOE), 2040C. POWER SUPPLY AND DEMAND OUTLOOK 
1. Total Electricity Consumption
From the 2018 level of 82,602 gigawatt-hour (GWh), total 
electricity consumption reaches 343,516 GWh in 2040 in the REF. 
Electricity savings under the CES reduce consumption by 4.0 
percent equivalent to 329,786 GWh by 2040. However, transport 
electricity consumption increases by as much as twice its 2040 
level in the REF as more EVs penetrate the country’s road system 
along with fully operational mass and light railway systems. The 
industry and residential sectors comprise the bulk of total 
electricity demand across the planning horizon. Meanwhile, the 
transport sector improves its share by 9.1 percent in 2040 from 
0.1 percent in 2018 (Figure 38). 
2. Peak Demand and Capacity Requirements
Under the REF, the total installed capacity reaches 90,584 megawatts (MW) by 2040 as compared 
with 93,482 MW of the CES (Table 15). The projected total peak demand of 60,034 MW in the REF 
and 57,303 MW in the CES require an additional total installed capacity of 71,817 MW (REF) and 
75,325 MW (CES) by 2040 from the 23,815 MW total installed capacity as of end-2018 (Figure 39).

How the Power Sector 
Responds to the Requirements 
of the PDP 2017-2022 and 
Clean Energy Policy
Electricity demand will 
increase by an average of 
6.7 percent annually. 
Transport’s electricity 
consumption under the 
CES doubles its level by 
2040 due to 10.0 percent 
penetration rate of electric 
vehicles and full operation 
of mass and light railway 
systems.
Annual savings of 5.0 
percent slows down 
electricity demand by 0.2 
percentage points – from 
6.7 percent under 
Reference to 6.5 percent 
under CESThe requirements of off-grid areas account for around two percent of the total electricity supply 
of the country. 
Consistent with the accelerated efforts to push for environment-friendly and sustainable fuels 
under the CES, the bulk of the capacity additions come from renewables, natural gas, other low 
carbon and highly efficient technologies.
The Luzon grid’s peak demand increases by four times, from the 10,876 MW in 2018 to 39,987 MW 
in 2040 (Table 16). The electricity demand growth requires an additional of 45,740 MW by the end 
of 2040. This additional capacity comprises 15,220 MW for baseload capacity, 8,400 MW for 
intermediate capacity, 18,500 for the variable capacity, 3,200 MW for the flexible capacity, and 420 
MW for the peaking capacity (Figure 40).

Figure 39. REFERENCE vs. CLEAN ENERGY: Capacities: Installed, Additional Capacities vis-à-vis Peak Demand, 2018-2040
REFERENCE SCENARIO CLEAN ENERGY SCENARIOThe Visayas grid's peak demand 
rises by more than four-fold, from 
2,053 MW in 2018 to 9,774 MW in 
2040. This translates to a total of 
8,564 MW additional capacity by 
the end of 2040 requiring 5,000 
MW of baseload capacity, 700 MW 
of intermediate capacity, 1,324 MW 
of the variable capacity, 1,340 MW 
of the flexible capacity, and 200 
MW of the peaking capacity.
The Mindanao’s peak demand 
picks up by more than five (5) 
times, from 1,853 MW in 2018 to 
10,273 MW in 2040. The grid then 
needs a total of 13,041 by the end of 2040 to meet the demand growth. The additional capacity 
constitutes 6,553 MW for baseload, 200 MW for intermediate capacity, 5,148 MW for the variable 
capacity, 1,100 MW for the flexible capacity, and 40 MW for peaking capacity.
3. Gross Generation and Fuel Input
With the capacity additions under the REF, total gross generation increases by 6.5 percent a year, 
from 99.8 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2018 to 394.5 TWh in 2040. In this scenario, coal contributes 
the bulk to the country’s power generation requirement with an average share of 57.6 percent 
share, followed by renewable and natural gas with 27.5 percent and 13.7 percent shares, 
respectively (Table 17). 
Figure 40. 2040 ADDITIONAL CAPACITIES PER GRID (MW)
CAPACITY REQUIREMENT DEFINITION 
PEAKING
▪ Produce power during peak system demand periods
▪ More responsive to changes in electrical demand and can be started up 
relatively quicker.
FLEXIBLE
▪ Facility with fast ramping/fast start-up and shutdown capabilities connected 
directly to the transmission or distribution system that helps manage 
fluctuations in supply and addresses the intermittency of increasing variable 
renewable energy power plants.
VARIABLE
▪ Generators with Variable output based on the availability of energy 
resources.
INTERMEDIATE
▪ Fill the gap between baseload and peaking plants.
▪ Runs more efficiently.
BASELOAD
▪ Plants which can generate consistent power to meet daily demand.
▪ Produce continuous, reliable and efficient power at low cost.
▪ Run at all times through the year except in the case of repairs or scheduled 
maintenance.The total fuel requirement for power generation grows by 5.3 percent across the planning period 
reaching 93.5 MTOE in 2040 from 29.7 MTOE in 2018. By the end of the planning period, fossil fuel 
accounts for 74.1 percent of the fuel input mix due to increased share of coal (Figure 41).
In the CES, generation output registers a 6.3 percent average yearly increase reaching 378.8 TWh
by 2040. Despite the slowdown vis-à-vis the REF, the mix of energy resources significantly changes 
in this scenario in 2040 as the share of coal drops to 33.4 percent, as displaced by renewables, 
natural gas and other low carbon technologies. As such, the aggregate gross generation from 
clean energy sources (RE, natural gas, and other technologies) jumps to 251.2 TWh, almost six times 
its 2018 level of 44.7 TWh, and accounts for 66.3 percent of the generation mix by 2040. The CES 
provides a window for the entry of other low carbon technologies contributing 9.5 TWh in the 
generation mix by 2040 (Figure 42).

Figure 41. REFERENCE vs. CLEAN ENERGY SCENARIO, Generation Input for Milestone Years (MTOE)The influx of highly efficient coal technologies under the CES leads to a reduction in the utilization 
of coal as fuel input for power generation. By 2040, coal’s share to total fuel input drops to 38.8 
percent compared to 61.9 percent under the Reference Scenario (Figure 41). RE and natural gas 
compensate for the reduction in coal input, increasing faster under the CES at 7.3 percent and 5.1 
percent growth, respectively, across the planning horizon.

▪ The agriculture sector 
registered the fastest 
increase in energy 
utilization at 7.3 percent, 
while commercial 
establishments reported a 
5.3 percent hike in 
consumption. The 
slowdown in manufacturing output resulted in a contraction of 1.8 percent in the amount of energy used 
for industrial processes. These trends in sectoral energy consumption were consistent with the 6.0
percent increase in the country’s aggregate economic output in 2019, as measured by GDP.
 
Figure 42. REFERENCE vs. CLEAN ENERGY SCENARIO, 2040 Power Generation Mix, By Fuel Shares▪ Oil remained the most consumed fuel with a 51.0 percent share, followed by electricity and biomass, 
with a 40.3 percent combined share to the TFEC. 
▪ Coal utilization registered an 8.0 percent slump from its previous year’s level of 2.4 MTOE to 2.2 MTOE 
in 2019. This was attributable to the slack in product volumes amidst the slowdown in construction 
activities, as well as delays in priority public infrastructure projects due to the late passage of the national 
budget. Non-energy demand, specifically that of coal and oil as raw materials in industrial processes, 
declined by 20.1 percent.

Assumptions for Impact of COVID19 to Energy Supply and Demand for 2020-2022
In order to assess the impact of COVID19 to the level of energy supply and demand in the short-term (2020–
2022), as well as the risks that will crucially impact the energy supply, the following assumptions were 
made:
▪ For 2020: Actual energy data for supply and demand situation available as of June 2020: Energy 
Balance Table (EBT) for 2019, electricity peak demand for January to June 2020; oil situation for 
January to June 2020; Quarantine protocols per issuances of the Inter-agency Task Force on 
Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) reflective of the impact of COVID-19; and, the National 
Economic and Development Authority-Development Budget Coordinating Committee (NEDADBCC) estimated contraction in the economic output (measured in terms of real GDP) of 5.5 
percent for 2020
▪ For 2021-2022: growth targets of NEDA-DBCC (as of 28 July 2020) pegged at 7.0 percent each year; 
effect of programmed economic stimulus packages and recovery plans as embodied in the 
projected economic rebound for 2021-2022 pushing energy demand to move via energy-to-GDP 
relationship, i.e. sectoral energy intensity 40 Based on NEDA-DBCC targets for 2020-2022 (as of 28 July 2020)
41 Refers to the scenario without impact of COVID19 in 2020, following the growth projections set forth under PDP 2017-2022 as discussed in Section A. 
Macroeconomic Assumptions of this Chapter
2020 with COVID-19 Pandemic 2021-2022 with Recovery Programs
Economic Targets40
▪ Bearing the brunt of one of the longest imposed 
quarantine restrictions among countries battling 
with COVID19, the county’s economic output for 
January to June 2020 took a steep 16.5 percent 
plunge. 
▪ The country’s economy rebounds with a 7.0 percent 
expansion in 2021, sustaining the same growth 
trend by 2022. Growth is largely hinged on the 
implementation of recovery programs, including 
allocated economic stimulus packages across all 
sectors. 
▪ With this, the country’s economy contracts by 5.5 
percent for FY 2020, based on the assumption 
that the economy will gradually resume its 
activities in the remaining months of the year. 
▪ The “Build, Build, Build” Program, once in full 
operation, provides the needed impetus towards 
economic recovery. 
Energy Demand
▪ The contraction in economic output results in a 
7.8 percent reduction in the TFEC for 2020, down 
by 12.0 percentage points from the projected 
growth under the Business-as-Usual (BAU)41.
▪ Energy demand posts strong positive increments 
with a 5.1 percent turnaround in the growth of the 
TFEC in 2021, followed by 4.7 percent in 2022.
▪ The transport sector bears the brunt of the 
restrictions imposed under varying levels of 
community quarantine, as its energy 
consumption registers a sharp decline of 16.9 
percent. 
▪ The improvements in transport infrastructures 
induce mobility and energy consumption in the 
sector to pick up by 6.7 percent in 2020, followed 
by 6.4 percent in 2022. The expected gradual 
recovery of air travel increases aviation fuel 
consumption by as much as 8.7 percent by 2022.
▪
✓
▪ The renewed investor confidence and effective tax 
programs refuel the country’s industry and services 
sectors, primarily the micro, small and medium 
enterprises. 
✓ The agriculture sector, benefiting from 
modernization programs, increase its energy 
utilization by 2.0 percent in 2021, followed by a 
2.3 percent expansion in 2022.
✓ Service establishments register a sustained 5.5 
percent hike in its energy consumption in 2021 
and 2022. 
✓ The industrial sector’s energy requirement 
recovers with 5.8 percent in 2021, and by 5.7 
percent in 2022 coinciding with the revival of the 
manufacturing subsector. 
▪ ▪
.▪ ▪ The aggregate oil demand posts an uptick of 5.9 
percent in 2021 and then increases by 5.5 percent in 
2022 with improved economic activity. The bulk of 
the increase comes from the transport and industry 
sectors. 
▪ Electricity consumption increases by 4.9 percent in 
2021 and by 5.9 percent in 2022. The transport 
sector’s electricity utilization doubles in 2021 as the 
MRT-7 becomes fully operational.

*red font – short-term outlookD. TOTAL PRIMARY ENERGY SUPPLY 
The country’s TPES under the REF grows at an average rate of 4.6 percent a year to reach 160.7 
MTOE in 2040 from 59.7 MTOE in 2018. Coal and oil continue to dominate the supply mix with 36.2 
percent and 32.3 percent average shares, respectively. Renewables contribute significantly in the 
TPES with an aggregate average share of 27.2 percent, while natural gas accounts for the 
remaining, with an average share of 4.4 percent across the planning period (Table 24).
In the CES, the TPES rises to 145.7 MTOE in 2040, 9.3 percent lower than the REF as growth slows 
down to 4.1 percent a year. The supply mix changes significantly between the two scenarios with 
4.4 percentage point’s reduction in the combined average share of oil and coal (64.1 percent in the 
CES against 68.5 percent in the REF). Expanding use of alternatives in the transport, greater 
utilization of 
renewables and highly 
efficient technologies 
cause the displacement 
of fossil fuels, 
particularly oil and coal, 
in the supply mix. 
Aggregate supply from 
renewables grows to 
44.3 MTOE, while 
diffusion of other 
technologies in the CES 
contributes 1.6 MTOE 
to the TPES by 2040
(Figure 43). Energy Selfsufficiency improves in the CES as the share of indigenous energy resources increases to 64.1 
percent in 2040 compared with 58.0 percent under the REF.

Figure 43. TOTAL PRIMARY ENERGY SUPPLY By Fuel Type, CES vs Reference: (MTOE)
for Milestone Years1. Fossil Fuels 
i. Oil primary supply grows by 4.4 percent a year, on average, in the REF, from 20.0 MTOE in 2018 
to 51.8 MTOE in 2040. Still, oil contributes significantly to the country’s total energy mix with 
an average share of 32.3 percent during the planning horizon. 
With the influx of alternative fuels (e.g., EVs, HEVs, CNG and 
biofuels) and improved vehicle efficiencies and mileage under 
the CES, dependence on oil drops by as much as 14.7 percent. 
Its annual average share to the TPES falls to 30.0 percent, as oil 
supply grows at a slower rate of 3.7 percent a year reaching 44.2 
MTOE in 2040. 
ii. Coal supply increases by 5.3 percent annually as its level rises 
four-fold from the 2018 level of 16.3 MTOE to 64.2 MTOE in 
2040. This translates to an average share of 36.2 percent of the 
TPES over the planning period under the REF. This is to provide 
for the rising requirement of coal in the power sector, as well as 
demand from the industry sector, specifically for cement and 
basic metals production. 
Reduction in coal capacity and generation output in the CES 
results in a slower growth rate at 4.1 percent a year, equivalent 
to 39.8 MTOE of coal supply requirement in 2040.
iii. Natural Gas supply increases at a rate of 5.3 percent a year, from 
3.6 MTOE in 2018 to 11.2 MTOE in 2040. Aside from the 
production coming from the Malampaya field and additional 
gas supply (uncontracted gas) until 2025, there are other 
natural gas sources (from smaller fields), such as the Libertad 
gas field in Cebu that started its commercial production in 2010. 
The potential gas fields that are foreseen to produce 
commercially within the next 20 years include Sultan sa Barongis
and Sampaguita by 2023, and the Sulu Sea by 2025, among 
others. 
Natural gas supply under the CES reaches 15.9 MTOE in 2040, 
assuming the realization of production targets. The growth is 
largely due to the government’s effort to promote the utilization of cleaner fuel42 for power 
generation.
2. Renewable Energy
Renewable energy accounts for an annual average share of 27.2 percent across the planning period 
under the REF, increasing at an average rate of 2.4 percent a year, from 19.7 MTOE in 2018 to 33.6 
MTOE in 2040. In the CES, renewables contribution improves to an average of almost 30.0 percent 
with 44.3 MTOE in 2040. Geothermal and biomass provide the largest share to total renewables 
both under the REF and CES.
42 Renewables and Natural gas
How Energy Supply 
Responds Vis-À-Vis Energy 
Demand under PDP 2017-
2022 and AmBisyon 2040?
Total energy supply in the REF 
grows at 4.6 percent annually, 
reaching 160.7 MTOE in 2040. 
By the end of the planning 
period, the energy mix is 
composed of coal (40.0 
percent), oil (32.0 percent), 
natural gas (7.0 percent) and 
renewables (21.0 percent). 
Under the CES, growth slows 
down to 4.1 percent per year. 
By 2040, the share of 
renewables to energy mix 
increases to 30.0 percent,
compensating the reduction in 
oil and coal. 
Geothermal and biomass
contribute the largest share to 
total renewables both under 
the REF and the CES.
The CES also provides a 
window for the entry of other 
technologies, particularly 
nuclear power. 
By 2040, energy selfsufficiency improves to 64.1
percent under CES.i. Geothermal energy remains to be the country’s major renewable resource accounting for an 
average share of 37.5 percent of the total renewables under the REF. Its production stands at 
10.2 MTOE in 2040 from 9.0 MTOE in 2018, which translates to a steady growth of 0.6 percent. 
In the CES, its contribution expands at 2.8 percent a year, which is translated to 16.4 MTOE in 
2040 with an average share of nearly 40.0 percent of the total renewables. This is equivalent 
to an 11.8 percent share to the TPES in the CES.
ii. Hydropower supply exhibits an average annual growth of 6.1 percent, from 2.3 MTOE in 2018 to 
8.7 MTOE in 2040, and contributes an average share of 5.3 percent of the TPES in the REF. Under 
the CES, the hydropower increases its levels to 11.1 MTOE in 2040 at an average rate of 7.3 
percent a year.
ii. Solar and wind under the REF improve their levels from around 0.2 MTOE in 2018 to 4.8 MTOE 
in 2040, and expands further to 6.3 MTOE for the same period in the CES, translating to a yearly 
increase of 16.8 percent, on average.
iv. Biomass43 for power and end-use applications contributes 8.7 percent average share to the TPES 
under the REF, posting an increment of 0.4 percent a year to reach 8.4 MTOE by 2040. Under 
the CES, biomass supply increases to 9.2 MTOE by 2040, corresponding to 0.8 percent annual 
growth per year, and accounting for an average share of 9.1 percent of the TPES. Despite the 
expected reduction in end-use biomass (non-power application44), its contribution gradually 
steps up for power generation from additional capacities of biomass power plant over the 
planning period. 
v. Biofuels current blend schedules of 2.0 percent biodiesel (B2) and 10.0 percent bioethanol (E10) 
increase the aggregate level by 5.1 percent in the REF – from 0.5 MTOE in 2018 to 1.6 MTOE in 
2040. However, the reduction of gasoline and diesel demand in the transport sector due to 
displacement from electricity and natural gas under the CES slows down aggregate biofuel 
consumption to 4.2 percent a year, on average. 
E. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION
In the REF, total GHG emission from fossil fuels (oil, coal and natural gas) increases at 6.0 percent 
per year across the planning period from 123.3 MtCO2e in 2018 to 444.5 MtCO2e in 2040. Emission 
from the consumption of coal accounts for an average share of 56.9 percent of the total GHG 
emission, while those from oil-based fuels exhibit an average share of 39.1 percent, and natural gas 
with a 4.0 percent share. 
Under the CES, where cleaner and more efficient fuels for transport and highly efficient coal and 
natural gas technologies take hold, along with the increased share of renewables, total GHG 
emission drops to 329.1 MtCO2e in 2040, down by 26.0 percent than the REF, as growth slows 
down at an annual average rate of 4.6 percent across the planning horizon (Figure 44). 
43 Includes charcoal, fuelwood, rice hull, bagasse, agriculture, municipal and animal waste
44 Includes charcoal
fuelwoodrice hullbagasseagriculture and animal wasteMore than half (54.8 percent) of 
the total emission under the REF 
comes from the transformation 
sector, specifically in power 
generation due to significant 
contribution of coal-fired power 
plants. Among the energy end-use 
sectors, transport registers the 
largest share of the total GHG 
emission at an average of 26.6 
percent, followed by industry with 
a 10.9 percent share. Other sectors 
(commercial, residential and 
agriculture) account for 7.7 
percent share of total. 
With the emergence of clean and highly efficient technologies 
for power generation and transport under the CES, the bulk of 
the reduction in GHG emission vis-à-vis Reference Scenario 
consequently come from the transformation and transport 
sector. In terms of fuel, the decreased utilization of oil for 
transport and coal in power generation lower the GHG 
emission under the CES (Figure 45).

 (REF vs. CES), MTCO2e
How Climate Change Initiatives 
under PDP 2017-2022 and 
AmBisyon2040 Impact the Energy 
Sector?
Under the REF, total GHG emission 
from energy-related activities 
increases by 6.0 percent a year
from 123.3 million tons of CO2 
equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2018 to 
444.5 MtCO2e in 2040. 
Cleaner and more efficient fuels 
for transport, and highly-efficient 
technologies for coal and natural 
gas under the CES reduces GHG 
emission to 329.1 MtCO2e in 2040, 
26.0 lower than the REF, while 
growth slows down by 4.6 percent
across the planning horizon.
Bulk of the reduction in GHG 
emission comes from power 
generation and transport. F. COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF SCENARIOS BASED ON THE 
BLENDED RATE OF POWER GENERATION
The blended rate of power generation under the REF registers yearly increments of 0.4 percent 
from 5.1 PhP/kWh in 2018 to 5.51 PhP/kWh in 2040 (Table 25). With the increased share of variable 
renewable energy or VRE (solar and wind) and other low carbon technologies in the mix, the 
blended rate under the CES increases at a bit faster rate of 0.7 percent a year resulting in 5.90 
PhP/kWh in 2040, up by 7.1 percent than the REF blended rate for the same year.
Despite the downward trend in investment costs of VRE, the blended rate under the CES is higher 
due to lower capacity factors of these technologies, thus, requiring more capacity additions than 
the REF.
 
G. POLICY IMPLICATIONS AND WAY FORWARD 
The results of this Outlook merit several policy implications and recommendations:
TRENDS / IMPACTS
1. The energy-economy indicators show significant trends, such as:
a. Economy-wide energy intensity under the CES drops by 53.0 percent (absolute terms) in 
2040 to 3.0 TOE/MPhP from its 2018 level of 6.4 TOE/MPhP, which is well below the APEC 
and ASEAN reduction targets with 2005 as base year. Annual decline in energy intensity 
hinges on the successful implementation of energy efficiency programs, apart from 
structural changes in the economy (e.g., the emergence of more non-energy intensive 
industries/processes).
b. Energy use per capita is expected to nearly double its 2018 level of 0.6 TOE to 1.0 TOE in 2040 
as a greater portion of the population gains access to energy services. Electricity per capita 
increases faster at 4.6 percent to 2,234.5 kilowatt-hours/person (kWh/person) by 2040. 
Achievement of the higher per capita level is guaranteed through the realization of the 100.0 
percent household electrification level by 2022, as well as the fully operational grid 
interconnection project – the Mindanao-Visayas Grid Interconnection project.

Note: The computation of the blended rate used a conversion rate of Php50/USD to determine the power rate in the future. MERALCOs blended 
rate of PhP5.1/kWh in 2018 is used to represent generation cost from existing power plants.2. The target of increasing the renewable capacity to at least 
20,000 MW based on 2010 level in the REF brings the share 
of RE to almost 50.0 percent of the total capacity mix in 
2040. This corresponds to 33.0 percent share of 
renewables in the generation mix for the same year, which 
falls short to the aspirational target of 35.0 percent share 
under the Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) for OnGrid. 45,46 Eventually, the said target share is achieved in the 
CES in 2040 with a 37.3 percent contribution to the power 
generation mix vis-à-vis a 54.0 percent share in the capacity 
mix. 
3. If there are no additional discoveries of natural gas 
reserves, supply depends solely on the importation of 
Liquefied natural gas (LNG) to meet domestic 
requirements after Malampaya’s resource depletion. 
4. Although higher energy self-sufficiency level (58.0 percent 
in REF and 64.1 percent CES) is seen to achieve over the 
planning period as compared with the 2018 level, still a 
considerable portion of the supply mix is sourced overseas. 
Dependence on imported energy, specifically oil and coal, 
and even LNG, is vulnerable to impeding threats of supply 
disruption from natural and human-induced disasters and 
pandemics that place the country’s energy supply security 
at risk.
5. Implementing a technology-neutral policy allows for the 
entry of other technologies in the country’s supply and 
power mix. Such policy intends to diversify the energy portfolio that balances the country’s 
goals of energy security, environmental sustainability and greater access to affordable energy 
that are deemed essential towards sustainable development. Renewables and natural gas 
contribute more to the country’s supply mix, consistent with achieving the goal of a low carbon 
future. 
6. Increasing biofuel blend to 20.0 percent for both biodiesel and bioethanol greatly contributes 
to decreasing further the GHG emission from the transport sector.
7. Higher penetration of electric vehicles reduces GHG emissions in the transport sector but 
potentially pushes up the GHG emissions from increased electricity production.
8. Passage of the Republic Act (RA) 11285 or Energy Efficiency and Conservation (EE&C) Act 
strengthens the implementation of the government’s EE&C programs intended to reduce the 
energy intensity of the different economic sectors. The energy savings target from EE&C 
programs is incorporated in the energy demand modeling. 
9. The trade-offs in using renewables as a mitigation option for GHG emission is the increase in 
generation cost that pushes up the electricity tariff. This has to be balanced with reliable low 
carbon technologies to lessen the impact on the electricity tariff.

46 Please refer to Annex 18 for Impact Analysis on RPS RE Target vis-à-vis Total Generation
How PDP 2017-2022 and 
AmBisyon2040 Impact the Energy 
Sector?
Energy intensity halves by 2040 
to 3.0 MTOE/MPhP from 6.5 
MTOE/MPhP in 2018 level.
Energy use per capita nearly 
doubles by 2040 – from its 2018 
level of 0.6 TOE to 1.0 TOE by 2040
Renewable capacity reaches 
25,266 MW by 2030 – almost 50.0 
percent of the total capacity mix.
Clean energy policies under the 
CES reduces the TPES by an 
average of 4.8 percent between 
2018 and 2040. The same policies 
also reduce GHG emission by 
26.0 percent by 2040. 
Under the CES, generation 
output from renewables is 
expected to reach 140.9 
terawatt-hour (TWh),
representing a 37.3 percent
share of the generation mix.WAY FORWARD
Overall targets and programs of the energy sector under the CES 
result in reduction of the TPES by 9.3 percent in 2040. At the same 
time, this leads to a drop in GHG emission by 26.0 percent. In order 
to realize these targets, the following are recommended:
1. Strengthen the implementation of existing policy mechanisms 
under the Renewable Energy Act of 2008 (RA 9513) to achieve the 
targets set forth in the National Renewable Energy Program 
(NREP) and attract new investments in the sector.
2. Mechanisms to enhance opportunities for foreign-owned 
companies to engage in renewable energy development should
be pursued, including the timely implementation of the green 
energy auction program (GEAP) in 2020-2021, green energy 
options program (GEOP) in 2020-2021; and renewable energy 
market (REM) for renewable energy certificates (RECs) trading in 
2021. 
3. Accelerate the policy mechanisms for LNG under the Philippine 
Downstream Natural Gas Regulation (PDNGR), which include the 
Gas Policy Development Program (GPDP), among others. The 
program aims to provide technical assistance in the evaluation of 
natural gas investment project applications to help develop the 
country’s LNG potential vis-à-vis energy security consideration of 
importing LNG. 
4. Conduct studies to come up with an appropriate pricing 
mechanism to make renewable and natural gas more 
competitive, specifically against coal. These should also assess 
the potential or positive impact in lowering electricity prices 
when tapped as dominant energy resources for power 
generation.
5. Consider establishing contingency measures to address the 
adverse impact of supply disruption on imported energy.
6. Promote an innovation culture, support new technologies and 
business models that have the potential to transform the energy 
system into a more efficient that addresses the real needs of the 
country.
7. Pursue a national position for the introduction of nuclear power 
as long-term energy options, which may also require a 
comprehensive assessment of its feasibility and applicability in 
the country. Nuclear energy is a prospective energy source that 
could be harnessed for greater energy security and supply 
stability in the near future and a potential option for GHG 
mitigation. This also improves the diversification of the supply 
mix, which may lead to a more competitive electricity rate.
What can be done?
▪ Strengthen the 
implementation of RE Law 
▪ Identify the policy 
mechanisms for LNG 
under the PDNGR
▪ Identify appropriate 
pricing mechanism for 
competitive RE and 
natural gas 
▪ Establish contingency 
measures to address the 
adverse impact of supply 
disruption on energy 
imports
▪ Promote innovative 
technologies that have 
the potential to transform 
the energy system
▪ Pursue a national position 
for nuclear power and 
other technology
▪ Improve the 
transparency and 
analysis in the energy 
rates with the adoption of 
unbundling policies
▪ Encourage investments 
and market competition 
in the power sector thru 
the implementation of the 
competitive selection 
process (CSP)
▪ Ensure public support for 
the implementation of 
alternative fuels for the 
transport sector
▪ Balance the trade-offs 
due to higher EVs in 
transport vis-à-vis 
increased electricity 
production
▪ Establish accurate 
baseline indicators to 
measure the 
effectiveness of EE&C Law 
implementation8. Continue to promote a technology-neutral policy and fuel diversification to remain responsive 
to the triple challenge of finding solutions on ensuring a secured, affordable and 
environmentally-sensitive energy – the Energy Trilemma Index. The intermittency of 
renewable energy sources must be supported by other indigenous energy resources to lessen 
the country’s reliance on imported energy and enhance energy supply security and 
independence. 
9. Improve the transparency of energy rates or prices with the adoption of unbundling policies. 
The details on price adjustments will also prevent any anti-competitive behavior among the 
industry players. With the passage of the Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001 (EPIRA) or 
RA 9136 that mandates the unbundling of electricity prices, the rate of the price increase slowed 
down vis-à-vis pre-EPIRA regime. The decline in the commercial and industrial prices relative to 
their pre-EPIRA levels were registered,
47 while the removal of cross-customer subsidies 
contributed to the divergence across customer rates, which reflect the actual cost of service 
delivery.
10.Conduct policy studies to cushion, if not arrest, the impact of higher electricity rates through, 
but not limited to, the removal of UCME and mandating higher efficiency improvements in the 
transmission.
11. Encourage investments and market competition in the power sector through the 
implementation of the CSP policy for power supply agreements (PSAs), including procurement 
of ancillary services. The CSP is envisioned to address the energy supply and affordability issues 
as it mandates distribution utilities (DUs) to auction off their PSAs to achieve adequate and 
stable supply, while allowing competition and least cost prices to ensure reasonable tariffs.
12. Conduct a study on the feedstock selection and availability, as well as the associated economic 
cost of biofuels.
13. Conduct a study on higher penetration of EVs on the trade-off between the possible reduction 
in GHG emission in the transport sector and the potential increase in GHG emission from 
increased electricity production. 
14. Establish accurate baseline indicators for the evaluation EE&C programs in identified priority 
sectors. These indicators are best provided by institutionalizing the conduct of energy-related 
surveys in the household, buildings, industry and transport sectors and other forms of data 
collection.
15. Ensure public support in government programs for the implementation of alternative fuels for 
the transport sector, such as the promotion of EVS and other vehicle modernization programs. 
16.Ensure the implementation and realization of the sectoral roadmaps and targets under this Plan 
to achieve the optimal energy scenario in the medium- and long-term through strict 
implementation of the Energy Virtual One-Stop Shop (EVOSS) Act or RA 11234 and the Executive 
Order (EO) 30.

PARTNERS AND REGULATOR
National Electrification Administration 
The National Electrification Administration (NEA) was created under RA 6038 signed in July 1969 
to carry out the total electrification of the country through the Rural Electrification Program (REP). 
It supervises the 121 Electric Cooperatives (ECs) as DUs in 78 out of 81 provinces of the country. 
The ECs play an important role, being one of the front-runners, in expanding energy access and 
attaining energy security. In 2019, the ECs provide electricity services to 78 provinces, 90 cities, 
1,385 municipalities, 36,065 barangays, 124,582 sitios and 13.47 million connections. 
The NEA remains committed in its mandate of providing electricity up to the remotest of villages 
of the country in line with the President’s directive to accelerate electrification by 2020 and the 
energy sector development agenda of expanding electricity access. Aside from its programs in 
electrification, NEA was also engaged in improving power distribution in Bangsamoro Autonomous 
Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), the unification of Davao del Norte Electric Cooperative, Inc. 
(DANECO) and mobilizing task forces to improve the reliability of electric services in specific areas, 
such as Task Forces of Palawan Electric Cooperative (PALECO), Occidental Mindoro Electric 
Cooperative (OMECO), and Abra Electric Cooperative (ABRECO). 
National Power Corporation 
The National Power Corporation (NPC) under the deregulated power industry serves as the 
government’s arm in providing reliable and reasonably-priced electricity supply in the “missionary 
areas or off-grid areas.” As of 2019, the NPC- Small Power Utilities Group (NPC-SPUG) owns a total 
of 139 power generating facilities, and manages the transmission and substation assets of the 
government in off-grid areas. 
As the major power supply provider in off-grid areas, the NPC supports the government’s program 
in providing greater access to electricity and in achieving the 100.0 percent household 
electrification level. The NPC continues to improve its operation by adding additional power 
generating capacities to extend the operating hours of electricity services of the ECs in off-grid 
areas. It has also completed the transmission network projects in Masbate province48 – the longstalled Mobo to Cataingan and Mobo to Aroroy 1 and 2 69kV transmission lines. 
The NPC launched the 300 kW Pandami Diesel Power Plant in Sulu in pursuit of its goal to achieve 
electrification in the off-grid islands49. Pandami is a fourth-class municipality in Sulu, which has a 
potential household of 2,300. The municipality’s major source of livelihood is fishing and farming.50
Likewise, the NPC is set to energize new areas in Samar province consisting of nine communities 
For the coming years, the NPC envisions to be a world-class power corporation providing reliable 
and reasonably-priced electricity in all missionary areas by 2025 and commits to perform the power 
and functions as provided under existing laws.

The National Transmission Corporation (TransCo) is a government-owned and controlled 
corporation created in 2001 under EPIRA, and a corporate entity wholly owned by the Power Sector 
Assets and Liabilities Management (PSALM). It is responsible for the operation and management 
of the power transmission system51. Given this mandate, TranscCo is one of the most crucial 
attached agencies of the DOE. The country’s transmission network is composed of 20,505 circuitkilometer (ckt-km) of transmission line with a total substation capacity of 34,852 megavolt-ampere 
(MVA). The TransCo's asset inspection teams continuously monitor the environmental compliance 
of the concessionaire (NGCP) pertinent to its operation and maintenance of transmission facilities 
in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao grids. 
National Grid Corporation of the Philippines
The National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) is a private-owned entity in charge of 
operating, maintaining, and developing the state-owned power grid52 and transmission assets 
under RA 951153. It is a consortium of three corporations, namely Monte Oro Grid Resources 
Corporation, Calaca High Power Corporation, and the State Grid Corporation of China. 
The NGCP prepares the Transmission Development Plan (TDP), which includes the ideal locations 
of future power plants that would best benefit the already existing transmission network. 
Resiliency planning is likewise embodied in the TDP, manifested as enhancement of transmission 
lines, careful site selection, increase of transmission tower strength and capacity, and security of 
transmission assets. The NGCP submits monthly status reports of the transmission projects and 
has also installed Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) compliant metering and real-time 
monitoring facilities for gleaning up to date information. 
Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation 
The Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM) is one of the DOE’s 
attached agencies whose principal purpose is to manage the orderly sale, disposition and 
privatization of the NPC generation assets, real estate and other disposable assets and the 
Independent Power Producer (IPP) contracts with the objective of liquidating all NPC financial 
obligations and stranded contract costs in an optimal manner. 
Philippine Electricity Market Corporation and the Independent Electricity Market Operator of the 
Philippines 
The Philippine Electricity Market Corporation (PEMC) is the governing arm of the WESM. The 
IEMOP was formed following the joint endorsement of the DOE and the industry participants of 
the transition to the IMO as required by the EPIRA. On 19 September 2020, PEMC and IEMOP 
executed an Operating Agreement transferring the operations of the WESM to IEMOP while 
retaining PEMC’s governance functions.
Energy Regulatory Commission
The Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) was created through the EPIRA as an independent, 
quasi-judicial regulatory body, which abolished the old Energy Regulatory Board (ERB). The ERC is 
51 links power plants to the respective electric distribution utilities on a national scale
52 interconnected system that transmits gigawatts of power to where it is needed 
53 An Act Granting the National Grid Corporation of The Philippines A Franchise to Engage In The Business Of Conveying Or Transmitting Electricity Through 
High Voltage Back-Bone System of Interconnected Transmission LinesSubstations And Related FacilitiesAnd For Other Purposes (01 December 2008)tasked to promote competition, encourage market development, ensure customer choice and 
penalize abuse of market power in the electricity industry. It ensures that the activities and rates 
of the energy players are unbundled to promote efficiency and transparency.
Philippine National Oil Company 
The Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC) is an energy company established through 
Presidential Decree (PD) 33454 during the Marcos Administration as a response to the 1973 First Oil 
Crisis. It is intended to serve as the corporate arm of the DOE and ensure oil supply in the country. 
Since then, various amendments on its charter have been made through the issuances of policies 
that modified its functions, including RA 7638 or the Department of Energy Act 1992. 
Aside from forging partnerships with oil suppliers, PNOC has been at the forefront of indigenous 
oil exploration and geothermal resources55. Currently, the PNOC is working towards the 
development and implementation of a gas distribution system, and the establishment of the 
strategic petroleum reserve of the country. 
In 2018, the PNOC commenced the solicitation for project proposal on the envisioned LNG Hub or 
Trading and Trans-shipment Hub that would place the country as an LNG distributor and exporter 
as well. The said project has been declared by the DOE as an Energy Project of National Significance 
(EPNS).
The PNOC has two subsidiaries that aid in the realization of its mandate: the PNOC-Exploration 
Corporation (PNOC-EC) and PNOC-Renewables Corporation (PNOC-RC).
a. PNOC-Exploration Corporation (PNOC-EC)
The PNOC-EC is a subsidiary assigned to take the lead in the exploration, development, 
utilization and marketing of oil, gas and coal, and other viable energy resources. With over 30 
years of industry presence, the PNOC-EC has established itself in the local petroleum setting 
with eight (8) petroleum service contracts, one of which is the SC 38 or the Malampaya Natural 
Gas Field.56 The PNOC-EC continues to deliver by studying more viable petroleum and coal 
reserves to secure the future demands these resources for the country. 
b. PNOC-Renewable Corporation (PNOC-RC)
The PNOC-RC is a fully-owned subsidiary established in 2008, the same year the RE Law was 
enacted, to promote the development and implementation of renewable resources that can 
be harnessed in the country. With the utilization of renewable sources, it targets to reduce 
the country’s reliance on oil importation, reduce GHG emissions, and further drive up energy 
security and self-sufficiency. Since 2008, it has developed several renewable projects, such as 
the 32-MW Maibarara Geothermal Project, 44-MW Nalatang Hydropower Project, and Solar 
PV Rooftop Projects in Metro Manila and Cebu.
54 Signed on 9 November 1973
55 Geothermal development function was affected when the PNOC-Energy Development Corporation (PNOC-EDC) was privatized in 2007.
56 The PNOC-EC holds a 10.0 percent stake in the Malampaya project with Chevron Malampaya LLC holding 45.0 percent and Shell Philippines Exploration 
(SPEX) getting the remaining 450 percentI. CREATING A REFORMED ENERGY INVESTMENT 
ENVIRONMENT
Realizing the important role of energy in fueling the country’s economic growth, the government 
has put in place several legislations to guarantee that investments in the energy sector are given 
utmost priority and immediate action. Issuances from the DOE were likewise promulgated to 
support such legislation in anticipation that energy investments will significantly increase and later 
on pave the way for the building of much-needed energy infrastructures to ensure a continuous, 
adequate and reliable supply of energy for the country. 
1. THE ENERGY VIRTUAL ONE STOP SHOP SYSTEM: Putting Up a Virtual Energy InvestmentFriendly System 
The EVOSS Act57 was promulgated on 19 March 2019 to streamline the permitting process of 
new projects for power generation, transmission and distribution. An EVOSS Steering 
Committee has been formed to finalize and concretize the framework on the detailed process 
flow of permitting procedures, including internal process of each member agency. The Office 
of the President serves as the Chair of the EVOSS Steering Committee and the DOE sits as the 
Vice-Chair with members from the different government agencies, private entities and endusers58
. 
The EVOSS system, an online system, shall be set up to allow coordinated submission and 
synchronous processing of required data and information and provide a single decision-making 
portal for actions on application for permits and licenses for energy projects. It is a paperless 
and electronic platform that serves as gateway for easier transactions among regulators and 
energy stakeholders, thereby reducing the burdens of doing transactions in the energy sector.
Part of the main functions of EVOSS is to recognize the legal effect, validity and enforceability 
of electronic documents submitted relative to energy project applications. An online payment 
system shall also be instituted for all fees imposed for application for 
permits/licenses/certifications of energy projects, and provide a paperless processing system 
for energy proponents (Figure 46). 
57 The EVOSS as defined in RA 11234 refers to an online system that allows the coordinated submission and synchronous processing of required data and 
information and provides a single decision-making portal for actions on application for permits/licenses/certifications necessary for energy projects. 
58 EVOSS Steering Committee is composed of the following members following: Department of Agriculture (DA), Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), 
Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), Department of Information, 
Communication and Technology (DICT), Department of Works and Highways (DPWH), Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC), National Commission on 
Indigenous Peoples (NCIP), National Water Resource Board (NWRB), Head of Market and System Operators and Representatives from Power 
Generation, Transmission and Distribution Sectors and End-Users. 
FIGURE 46. EVOSS FUNCTIONS AND CHARACTERISTICS PER SECTION 6 OF R.A. 11234Likewise, the EVOSS provides a leeway for the member government agencies and entities to reassess/review their regulatory processes and procedures on the issuance of 
permits/licenses/certificates, and correspondingly reduce the turn-around time allotted for 
each process and procedure to comply with the timeframe as listed in Table 26.
The EVOSS System is the first inter-agency energy on-line virtual system designed to cater to 
energy applications and at the same time work as a repository of project-related information 
relative to permits issuance and approval. Further, it is a web-based monitoring system that is 
shared among government agencies involved in the processing and issuance of 
permits/licenses/certificates for energy projects to promote and ensure transparency and 
accountability. 
Currently, the EVOSS System includes the application for renewable energy development 
projects. As the lead agency, the DOE is continuously working on the enhancement of the 
System to incorporate other features stipulated in the Act. Since its roll-out on 24 July 2020, 
the System holds a total of 12 energy project applications - which are all renewable projects.
2. EXECUTIVE ORDER 30: Creation of Energy Investment Coordinating Council (EICC)
On 28 June 2017, President Rodrigo Roa Duterte issued EO 30 
to ensure a continuous, adequate and economic supply of 
energy throughout the country. The said EO created the 
Energy Investment Coordinating Council (EICC) and set the 
definition and specific attributes for the declaration of 
certain projects as “Energy Projects of National Significance 
(EPNS).” Under the EO, the EICC is mandated to spearhead 
and coordinate national government efforts to streamline 
regulatory procedures, simplified approval process, and 
harmonized rules and regulations of all permitting 
government agencies to expedite the development of 
energy projects and avoid delays. The EICC is chaired by the 
DOE and composed of representatives from 18 different 
government agencies as Council Members59. 
On 25 April 2018, Secretary Alfonso G. Cusi, Chairperson of the EICC, issued DC 2018-04-0013 
providing the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of EO No. 30. The IRR governs the 
permitting process for the approval and implementation of logical, systematic, organized and 
speedy issuance of permits and clearances for the EPNS.
Nominating an Energy Project of National Significance (EPNS)
Pursuant to EO 30 and its IRR, EPNS are major energy projects for power generation, 
transmission and/or ancillary services including those required to maintain grid stability. These 
projects should be in consonance with the policy thrusts and specific goals of the PEP, and 
which possess any of the following attributes:
59 The EICC Member Agencies are the following: Department of Trade and Industry-Board of Investment (DTI-BOI), Department of Environment and Natural 
Resources (DENR), Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Finance (DOF), Department of Transportation (DOTr), Department of Interior and Local 
Government (DILG), Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development (Formerly Housing and Land 
Use Regulatory Board (HLURB)), National Commission for Indigenous Peoples (NCIP), Mindanao Development Authority (MinDA), National 
Electrification Administration (NEA), National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP), National Power Corporation (NPC), National Transmission 
Corporation (TransCo), Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC), National Water Resources Board (NWRB), National Economic Development Authority 
(NEDA)and Palawan Council for Sustainable Development (PCSD)

g. Significant Infrastructure Requirements.
Through the issuance of a Certificate of EPNS (CEPNS), a project is given specific rights, namely: 
a. Action within 30 working day period (Table 26) upon submission of complete documentary 
requirements to the relevant permitting agencies. All concerned agencies involved in the 
processing and approval of permits and licenses are directed, with respect to the permits 
and processes within their jurisdiction, to act and determine the compliance of the project 
within the aforementioned period; and, 
b. Presumption of prior approval specifies that the government agency can no longer defer the 
processing until the issuance of other government agencies’ permits/licenses are granted as 
pre-condition(s) for the application. It is this concept that would allow for the simultaneous 
or parallel application of permits/license in the different government agencies as there is no 
need to wait for the others to act first. The government agency can issue a provisional 
permit/license subject to the granting of other permit(s)/license(s) from other agencies.

about PhP 681.9 billion. These include 66 power plants, 57 transmission projects, 16 renewable 
energy development, four exploration activities, and two LNG facilities. 
To further screen and ensure that only those projects that qualify as EPNS shall be declared and 
granted with a certificate (CEPNS), and to show a concrete illustration of the attributes under 
the EO 30, the EICC has established a set of Sub-Attributes serving as the parameters for the 
evaluation of projects applying for CEPNS as shown in Table 27.
With EVOSS already enforced, all energy projects granted with CEPNS will be integrated in the 
EVOSS System adopting the 30-day timeframe, or whichever is shorter (EVOSS timeframe) as 
shown in Table 26. 
3. Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act of 2018 
On 28 May 2018, the RA 11032 or otherwise known as “Ease of Doing Business and Efficient 
Government Service Delivery Act of 2018” was signed into law by the President. It is one of the 
major policy milestones of the government, which aims to streamline and improve the current
systems as well as procedures of government services. This is consistent with Priority 3 of the 
of the Duterte Administration’s Ten-Point Socio-Economic Agenda that seeks to improve the 
competitiveness of and ease of doing business in the Philippines. The Law applies to all 
government offices and agencies in the executive branch including local government units 
(LGUs), GOCCs, and other government instrumentalities that provide services covering 
business-related and non-business transactions. 
With the passage of the Law, the Ease of Doing Business and Anti-Red Tape Advisory Council 
has been created. The DTI chairs the Council with Anti-Red Tape Authority (ARTA), Department 
of Information and Communications Technology (DICT), DILG, DOF and representatives from 
the private sector as members. The Council serves as the policy and advisory body with the 
responsibility of formulating policies and programs that will continuously enhance and improve 
the country’s competitiveness and ease of doing business. 
The Law also provides for the re-engineering of government systems and procedures to 
eliminate bureaucratic red tape and reduce processing time. Thus, to enforce the reduction of 
processing time for business transactions, a timeframe per transaction (Table 28) is mandated 
to all government agencies including LGUs, GOCCs and other instrumentalities. 
Table 28. TIMEFRAME PER TRANSACTIONS AS PROVIDED BY RA NO. 11032
Simple Transaction Action within 3 days
Complex Transaction Action within 7 days
Highly Technical Transaction Action within 20 days
4. Administrative Order (AO) No. 23: Eliminating Overregulation to Promote the Efficiency of 
Government Processes
To promote efficiency in government process, President Duterte issued on 21 February 2020 the 
Administrative Order (AO) 23 titled “Eliminating Overregulation to Promote Efficiency of 
Government Processes” to eradicate overregulation and improve the government system in 
delivering services to the people. The said AO stipulates that the timelines provided for by the 
EVOSS Act shall be complied and applied to all processes/procedures relative to all energy projects. Moreover, the EVOSS Steering Committee will accept recommendations from the 
ARTA. 
5. Joint Memorandum Circular (JMC) No. 2020-1: Enhancing Energy Investments thru Partnership 
with Local Government Units (LGUs)
On April 30, 2020, the DOE and DILG signed a Joint Memorandum Circular (JMC) 2020-1 to 
facilitate the implementation of energy projects in the LGU unit level. The JMC aims to establish, 
strengthen and integrate the national energy plans, programs, policies and mechanisms into 
local development plans with respect to energy safety practices, energy efficiency and 
conservation, energy resiliency and energy planning, which include energy access and resource 
development. It harmonizes and accelerates the implementation of the EVOSS Act, Ease of 
Doing Business (EODB) Act, and Executive Order (EO) 30 and AO 23 with the establishment of 
a unified and streamlined permitting process. 
Through the JMC, the benefits to host communities from the energy projects will be maximized. 
The JMC also aims to implement the other necessary energy programs and projects to spur total 
development of the LGUs.
Through a whole-of-government approach, the mentioned initiatives will effectively result in 
streamlining and reduction of turn-around time required in regulatory processes and procedures, 
while promoting transparency and accountability among government agencies involved in the 
approval of energy projects. Also, the DOE, as the lead agency in implementing both the EVOSS 
Act and the EO 30 is working on the harmonization of the said two important policies to come up
with an efficient and reformed energy investment-friendly environment for its stakeholders. It is 
thus expected that these efforts shall ease the burden of stakeholders engaged in doing energy 
investments in the country.Harnessing indigenous energy resource is one of the government’s priority thrusts to ensure 
continuous deliver of energy services as a prerequisite for the country’s economic growth and 
progress. With rapidly increasing domestic energy demand, the Department of Energy (DOE) has 
been resolute in finding new discoveries of fossil fuel resources to further improve energy selfsufficiency level of the country and provide Filipinos with stable energy supply. The DOE is guided 
by Presidential Decree (PD) Nos. 87 (Oil Exploration and Development Act of 1972) and 972 (Coal 
Development Act of 1976) in its continuing efforts to promote the discovery, exploration, 
development, production and utilization of indigenous oil, gas and coal resources. 
The development of conventional energy 
resources will not only bring investments for 
the country but will benefit the local 
government units (LGUs) as well. As indicated 
in Chapter 2 of the Local Government Code of 
1991, LGUs are entitled to equitable share in the 
proceeds derived as host community of natural 
resources, to be allocated as 20.0 percent for the province, 45.0 percent for component city or 
municipality and 35.0 percent for barangay60. In turn, LGUs are expected to allocate 80.0 percent 
of the funds to the reduction of electricity costs while 20.0 percent to local development and 
livelihood projects. 
Mindful of the importance of securing oil supply for the country during the first oil crisis in 1973 and 
to embark on measures for stable supply of petroleum products, the Philippine National Oil 
Company (PNOC) and its subsidiary, the PNOC Exploration Corporation (PNOC-EC) were created 
through PD 334 (November 1973) and Batas Pambansa (BP) Blg. 68 (April 1976), respectively. 
Various amendments were made to their Charters to include exploration, exploitation and 
development of all energy resources.
60 If in case where the natural resources are located in two (2) or more provinces or in two or more component cities or municipalities or in two or more 
barangaystheir respective shares shall be computed on the basis of population (700 percent) and land area (300 percent)
 
 UPSTREAM OIL AND GAS
The DOE has been steadfast in boosting
investment opportunities in the upstream 
oil and gas sector, especially with the 
impending depletion of the Malampaya61
gas field in the near future. 
The global trend points towards the use of 
cleaner energy sources such as renewables. 
However, the promotion of an optimal 
energy mix utilizing all available energy 
sources is pivotal to meet the growing 
energy requirements of the country. This 
view is supported by the World Economic 
Forum62 noting that around 31.0 percent of 
primary energy used globally is oil-based 
fuels, while natural gas represents 21.0 
percent of the total world energy supply. 
The country has modest resource potential 
located in 16 sedimentary basins covering an 
area of more than 700,000 square 
kilometers (km2) with a combined potential 
of 4,777 million barrels of fuel oil equivalent 
(MMBFOE) of oil and gas resources (Figure 
47).
These basins are located in the 
following areas: (1) Ilocos Shelf; (2) 
Cagayan; (3) Central Luzon; (4) Bicol 
Shelf; (5) Southeast Luzon; (6) 
Mindoro-Cuyo; (7) West MasbateIloilo; (8) Visayan; (9) Agusan-Davao; 
(10) Cotabato; (11) Sulu Sea; (12) East 
Palawan; (13) Southwest Palawan; 
(14) Reed Bank; (15) Northwest 
Palawan; and (16) West Luzon 
Trough. The sedimentary fill ranges 
from one (1) km. (Northwest Leyte 
sub-basin of the Visayan Basin) to as 
thick as 15 kms. (Southern part of the 
Sulu Sea Basin).
As shown in Figure 48, four (4) 
sedimentary basins with total aerial 
extent of 167,000 km2 are underlying 
the West Philippine Sea. 
61 The Malampaya Deep Water Gas to Power Project of Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. (SPEX) has been the country’s major source of natural gas since 
2001. The consortium’s Service Contract (SC) 38 contract will expire by 2024.

4. The Southwest Palawan Basin has high potential to contain hydrocarbon resources based on 
the location’s proximity to the Malaysian basin. 
A. ASSESSMENT
The Malampaya Deep Water Gas-to-Power project remains the largest source of natural gas in the 
country since the start of its commercial production in January 2002. Its production fuels five (5) 
natural-gas power plants contributing nearly 30.0 percent of power generation in Luzon in 2018 
and 2019. 
From January 2002 until June 2018, the government already collected royalties amounting to PhP
263 billion from the Malampaya project in accordance with PD 123463 issued on 08 November 1977. 
To maximize the exploration and 
development of indigenous 
petroleum and coal resources, the 
DOE issued in September 2017 the 
Department Circular (DC) 2017-12-
0017 introducing the “Philippine 
Conventional Energy Contracting 
Program (PCECP).” The PCECP is a 
new contracting scheme for 
petroleum and coal exploration 
wherein two modes of awarding 
Service Contract (SC) is envisioned. 
The first mode is through the 
nomination process, which enables
investors to apply for 
service/operating contracts
anywhere in the country at any 
given time, while the other mode is through application in Pre-Determined Areas (PDAs) previously 
identified/delineated by the DOE. 
The DOE conducted a series of local and international roadshows to promote the PCECP during the 
last quarter of 2018 and first half of 2019 in the Cities of Puerto Princesa, Davao and Zamboanga,
as well as in Singapore, Cape Town (South Africa) and Texas (USA). 
63 Institutionalizing a Procedure for the Management of Special and Fiduciary Funds Earmarked or Administered by the Departments, Bureaus, Offices and 
Agencies of the National GovernmentIncluding Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations
“The DOE is aggressively pursuing the implementation of the PCECP so the country could 
establish a strong ‘Explore, Explore, Explore’ program.” Secretary Alfonso G. Cusi during the 
launching of the PCECPThe 180-day application period for the 14 predetermined areas for offer started during the 
Program’s launching ceremony held on 22 
November 2018 at the Shangri-la in Bonifacio 
Global City in Taguig City. As a result, revenues 
on data and application fees amounting to PhP
9.28 million was recorded from 10 interested 
companies under the PCECP. 
In terms of exploration and development, the 
DOE monitored and supervised the operation of 20 active SCs (Figure 49) as of 2019. The DOE’s 
attached agency, PNOC EC, currently operates three (3) contracts located in Isabela (SC 37), 
Calamian Block in Northwest Palawan (SC 57), and Southwest Palawan (SC 59) covering a total area 
of 25,630 km. 
The newest oil field discovery located in Alegria, Cebu was inaugurated by President Rodrigo R. 
Duterte on 19 May 2018. Under SC 49, its operator, China International Mining Petroleum Company 
Limited (CIMP), discovered about 27.9 MMBO with a possible production recovery of 3.4 MMBO. 
The field also has natural gas reserves of 9.4 BCF with estimated recoverable resource of 6.6 BCF, 
which could fuel a power plant connected to the local power grid. This oil field is expected to 
contribute to the country’s energy supply needs. 
Petroleum production in 2017 reached 1.6 million barrels of oil (MMBO), 138.5 billion cubic feet 
(BCF) of gas and 3.9 MMBO of associated condensate. Although oil production decreased in 201864
at only 1.3 MMBO, gas and associated condensate recorded significant increases at 154.6 BCF and

Figure 49. ACTIVE SERVICE CONTRACTS IN THE PHILIPPINESAnother major 
accomplishment of the 
sector is the President’s 
signing of SC 7665 in 
Eastern Palawan on 17 
October 2018, the first SC 
signed under the Duterte 
administration. The
Ratio Petroleum Ltd.
(proponent of SC 76) will 
conduct exploration 
activities covering the 
Area 4 in East Palawan 
Basin for potential 
energy resources. The 
area covers 416,000 
hectares (has.) with 
minimum total expenditure valued at USD 34.4 million. 
B. PLANS AND PROGRAMS
To achieve the overall objectives of the upstream oil and gas sector by 2040, the DOE identified 
several targets to include drilling of additional oil and gas fields during the planning horizon (Figure 
50). 
65 Under initial stages of exploration including geological and geophysical study of the area. Acquisition of seismic data is being undertaken for an indepth information on the area’s potential
DOE Secretary Alfonso G. Cusi discusses the specifics of the Alegria oil field with Guests of Honor, President 
Rodrigo R. Duterte and Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go, during the launching of the new oil field 
located in Cebu. The said oil field has the distinction of being the country’s first onshore discovery.
Figure 50. UPSTREAM OIL AND GAS ROADMAP1. Medium-Term 
The drilling of an oil prospect in the Visayan Basin will bring in potential recoverable reserves of up 
to 20.0 MMBO,while a total of 2.2 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of gas could be produced from the drilling 
of two gas prospects in Northwest Palawan. 
In terms of production, crude oil output is expected to reach 5.6 MMBO with biggest contribution 
of 3.4 MMBO from the Galoc field in Northwest Palawan. West Linapacan-A is likewise forecasted 
to provide 1.2 MMBO of oil when it commences production in 2022. The marginal fields may also 
account for about 1.0 MMBO for the same period with projected production of 540,200 barrels
(bbl) from Polyard Area 6. Moreover, 
significant contribution of 513,000 bbl
may be expected beginning 2021 from 
Octon and Cadlao. 
For gas, Malampaya field will continue 
to supply 99.3 percent of the country’s 
natural gas contributing 584,000 
million standard cubic feet (MMSCF) 
out of the expected 588,331 MMSCF 
during the four-year period (2019-
2022). 
2. Long-Term 
Two oil prospects over the Visayan and Northwest Palawan Basins with potential recoverable 
reserves of 3.6 and 20.0 MMBO, respectively, and two gas prospects in Northwest and Southwest 
Palawan Basins with 3.6 TCF of reserves are targeted to be drilled between 2023 and 2040. 
Oil production of 114.4 MMBO is projected to come from Galoc, West Linapacan A, CamagoMalampaya oil prospects, as well as from marginal fields of Polyard Area 6, Octon, Cadlao, 
Linapacan, Calauit, Malolos, and two other oil prospects. 
Meanwhile, gas production of 4.04 TCF is expected to come from seven (7) fields: Malampaya, San 
Martin, Sampaguita, Polyard A8, Mangosteen, and two other gas prospects. 
3. Strategies
With the current issues on the West Philippine Sea affecting the exploration and production in the 
oil and gas industry, the DOE will continue to advocate the government’s initiatives in resolving the 
pending issues affecting the stability of the petroleum SCs and enable the resumption of 
exploration activities of SCs that are under Force Majeure.
Another strategy is the implementation of Executive Order (EO) 60, series of 2011 reorganizing the 
Philippine Gas Project Task Force to the Philippine Upstream Petroleum Task Force. This will enable 
the government and industry stakeholders to establish a more effective platform to address interagency issues affecting the timely and efficient implementation of petroleum service contracts and 
formulate policy measures to address such issues and concerns.
In terms of legislative agenda, part of the sector’s action plan to accomplish the sector’s mediumand long-term targets is the continuous formulation and implementation of policy issuances on the upstream petroleum sector, such as the streamlining of petroleum-related activities of SC 
operators/holders and other relevant policies to hasten the exploration activities and discovery of 
new fields in the country. The DOE will also review the provisions of PD 87 and formulate necessary 
amendments such as the 60-40 sharing scheme on joint explorations for oil and gas. 
Moreover, continuous bilateral and multilateral cooperation with other countries to strengthen oil 
and gas activities, petroleum security and potential synergy between parties is seen as an effective 
program to further boost the sector. 
Lastly, the DOE will assess the required oil and gas transportation and storage infrastructure to 
further benefit the country’s petroleum industry. 
C. INVESTMENT AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES
Under the PCECP, the country may expect a 
total investment of USD 48.6 million upon the 
President’s signing of the two SCs 
recommended for awarding. The projects’ 
various stages of exploration, development, 
and production will also generate jobs to 
Filipinos.
An additional potential investment of USD 43.7 
million may be generated upon approval of 
applications received for Nominated Areas 1 
and 5 and PDAs 6 and 7. 
Since the implementation of the PCECP, the DOE has been continually accepting nominations for 
various areas of interests delineated by interested parties. Figure 51 shows the 14 areas for offer 
under the PCECP, while the requisites for documentation to be submitted by proponents in the 
contracting program for petroleum are outlined in Annex A of DC 2017-12-001766.

UPSTREAM COAL
Coal is currently the most important energy source for electricity generation, accounting for 
approximately 38.4 percent of global electricity generation in 2017 due to abundance, low cost and 
ability to generate base load electricity67. 
As coal proves itself to be economically-viable
being one of the most reliable and affordable 
sources of energy, the DOE will strengthen its 
efforts to embrace less polluting and more 
efficient technologies.
In response, the San Buenaventura Power 
Plant68 in Mauban, Quezon is set to become the 
first supercritical power generation plant in the 
country using the state-of-the-art emissions 
control technology, an electrostatic precipitator 
for fly-ash capture and removal, and a sea water 
desulfurizer to further reduce potential air 
pollution. 
A. ASSESSMENT
1. Exploration and Development Activities 
The country has vast coal resource potential standing at 2.4 
billion metric tons (BMT) from the 14 coal regions spread all 
over the country with additional 397 million metric tons 
(MMMT) of in-situ coal reserves. The largest resource 
potential is in Semirara, Antique with 550 MMMT, while the 
smallest is in Quezon with 2.0 MMMT.
The 14 coal regions with available resource potential and insitu reserves are listed in Figure 52.

with respect to their corresponding work commitments. Of the total COCs, 31 are in the 
development and production stage, while the remaining 31 are in the exploration phase as shown 
in Table 29 and Figure 53. The PNOC-EC currently operates four coal operating contracts: COCs 41, 
185 and 186 located in Zamboanga Sibugay and COC 122 in Isabela. 
Total coal production in 201869 was recorded at 13.1 MMMT, a slight decreased from 2017 level of 
13.3 MMMT. Bulk of which was sourced from the Semirara, the largest producer of coal in the 
country.

As the DOE prioritizes the health and safety of all workers involved in the coal mining operations, 
Secretary Cusi signed DC 2018-12-0028 titled “Coal Mine Safety and Health Rules and Regulations” on 
28 December 2018. The new Circular repealed the 40-year old Bureau of Energy Development 
Circular No. 1, otherwise known as “Coal Mine Safety Rules and Regulations,” issued on 03 January 
1978. The new rules and regulations are more applicable to the present local coal mining conditions 
and are aligned with the requirements of the International Labor Organization Convention on 
Safety and Health in Mines (ILO C176). 
Likewise, the DOE issued DC 2018-03-0006 on 15 March 2018 to further streamline and simplify the 
processing and issuance of tax-exempt certificates, as provided under PD 87and PD 972. The said 
Circular shall govern the application, processing, approval, and issuance of tax-exempt certificates 
for the importation, exportation, and disposal of machinery, equipment, spare parts and materials 
used for petroleum and coal operations. 
B. PLANS AND PROGRAMS
The overall 2040 objective of the sector to contribute to the country’s energy requirements 
through increasing indigenous coal reserves will be realized upon the accomplishment of the 
medium- and long-term targets highlighted in Figure 54.
Figure 54. UPSTREAM COAL ROADMAP1. Medium-Term 
Based on the roadmap and overall objectives of the upstream coal sector, the DOE intends to 
increase the delineated70 coal reserves to 530.0 MMT and additional reserves of 65.0 MMT from 
existing and new COCs and Small-Scale Coal Mining Permits (SSCMPs) by 2022. 
In terms of production, 52.0 MMT is targeted in the next three (3) years as the sector’s targets and 
contribution to meet the country’s energy requirements. 
2. Long-Term
For the period 2023-2040, further increases of delineated coal reserves up to 766.0 MMT including 
additional reserves of 288.0 MMT are also expected from existing and new COCs and SSCMPs.
Coal production in the long-term period is forecasted to reach 282.0 MMT from the existing and 
committed coal projects in the country. 
3. Strategies
To hurdle the challenges that may impede the realization of the targets and the fulfillment of the 
sector’s overall objectives, the DOE will put in place the following strategies: 
▪ Strengthen existing policy on coal handling, transport, storage and distribution to include 
stricter safety/security and environmental regulation and pollution control protocols. 
▪ Attract more investors to participate in the upstream coal exploration, development and 
production;
▪ Review, amend and formulate policies on exploration, development, and utilization of coal 
as well as address the emerging environmental and community issues in the conduct of coal 
mining activities;
▪ Assess the required infrastructure support for coal development; 
▪ Coordinate with local government units (LGUs) and key stakeholders to resolve community 
issues about coal operations;
▪ Monitor compliance of COCs with work commitments and regulations relating to the 
exploration, development and production activities;
▪ Close coordination with other government agencies in the acquisition of necessary permits, 
licenses and endorsements to ensure efficient implementation and success of energy 
projects;
▪ Conduct and participate in resource assessment projects to update the current indigenous 
coal resources; and, 
▪ Pursue international bilateral and multilateral cooperation activities to keep abreast with the 
development in the industry.
C. INVESTMENT AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES
Pursuant to Executive Order (EO) 3O creating the Energy Investment Coordinating Council (EICC), 
two coal projects have been issued with Certificate of Energy Projects of National Significance 
(CEPNS) by the DOE. These projects by PNOC-EC are expected to yield total potential investments
of PhP 143.8 million for exploration activities (Table 30). 
70 Determined coal reserves based on computation Another project from PNOC-EC is COC 41 which is
located in Diplahan, Malangas and Imelda in 
Zamboanga Sibugay. The project is expected to yield 
an estimated PhP 4.0 billion in investments and may 
generate more than 1,000 jobs during its 
construction. The COC 41 also has an estimated 
production of 1.33 MMT. 
By the end of the planning horizon, the expected 
investment based on the target additional 
production in the sector’s roadmap will reach PhP
609.3 billion. For the medium-term, a total of PhP
112.4 billion is projected upon the production of 52 
MMT of additional coal production. On the other 
hand, almost PhP 497.0 billion may be generated 
from the target 230 MMT coal production during the 
long-term period (Table 31).

PNOC-EC’s COC 41 Zamboanga Sibugay Coal ProjectThe downstream oil and natural gas industries are integral for the growth of global economy as
both continue to be key components of the energy system. In 2018, oil and natural gas accounted 
for about 35.0 percent and 24.0 percent of the global primary energy consumption, respectively71. 
Global forecast shows that oil grows on 0.4 percent per year, while natural gas increases at a much 
faster rate of 1.6 percent per year, overtaking coal as the second biggest energy source by 2040.
Despite a slower growth rate, oil remains an important fuel with 27.6 percent share to global 
primary energy consumption in 204072. Natural gas maintains its share at around 25.0 percent.
In the local setting, oil and gas industries made significant contributions to economic development, 
energy security, safety and health, and environmental protection through the institutionalization 
of standards and practices. Together, these industries are important drivers for economic growth 
and prosperity of the country.
NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY
In 1991, Shell Philippine Exploration B.V. (SPEX) drilled the Malampaya gas field, which became the 
largest gas discovery in the country with proven reserves of 2.7 to 3.2 trillion cubic feet (Tcf). The 
Malampaya Deep Water Gas-to-Power project is one of the largest and most significant industrial 
endeavors in Philippine history. The project is spearheaded by the DOE, developed and operated 
by SPEX on behalf of joint venture partners – Chevron Malampaya LLC and the Philippine National 
Oil Company-Exploration Corporation (PNOC-EC).
73
As the principal agency for the development of the country’s natural gas industry, the DOE 
envisions a roadmap towards its acceleration and growth. The roadmap serves as the guidepost in 
the realization of the essential mechanisms to accelerate the development of the country’s natural 
gas industry. Said roadmap has an overall objective to “establish a world-class, investment driven 
and efficient natural gas industry that makes natural gas a bridge fuel by all end-use sectors.”

73 Overview of Malampaya retrieved from https://malampaya.com/about/
 This roadmap intends to reinforce the downstream natural gas industry development program, 
formulate and implement the required policies, and achieve a globally competitive manpower 
through constant development of skills for the regulators and industry players. 
Transforming the industry from an emerging developmental stage to a matured industry with 
cutting-edge technologies does not only provide a cleaner source of energy but creating more jobs 
for the country. Our neighboring countries like Japan, China, and India are importers of liquefied 
natural gas (LNG) as a crucial fuel source in their energy supply mix. 
On the domestic front, the Philippines, with its strategic location, should also capitalize on this 
global trade and benefit from the LNG market. With this, the DOE envisions the country as an LNG
trading and trans-shipment hub to distribute LNG to other importing countries in the Asia-Pacific 
Region. 
A. ASSESSMENT
1. Implementation of the Natural Gas Quality Standard
On 01 February 2019, Secretary Alfonso G. Cusi signed Department Circular (DC) 2019-02-0004,
which promulgates the rules to regulate the importation, trading, supply and distribution of 
natural gas in the country with the intention of making it an LNG trading and trans-shipment hub 
in the Asia-Pacific Region. Under the rules, the DOE will require all businesses engaged in natural 
gas to submit the proper reportorial requirements in compliance with the Philippine Downstream 
Natural Gas Regulation (PDNGR)74. The submissions will include the use of standard measurements 
for natural gas, namely cubic meters (m3) for natural gas under standard temperature and pressure 
(STP); joules (J) for natural gas energy; megajoules per cubic meter (MJ/m3) for superior calorific 
value and wobbe index; percent mole for the chemical composition of natural gas such as 
methane, oxygen, total inerts; and, milligrams per cubic meters for total sulfur and hydrogen 
sulfide. The Circular provides a mandatory compliance to the gas quality for the LNG importer and
supplier of natural gas to end-users. Compliance to the Philippine National Standard (PNS) on gas 
quality is important as it presents safety issue as quality variation has implications for the operation 
of all gas equipment due to changes in combustion performance.
2. Joint Administrative Order (JAO) for the creation of the Philippine Inter-Agency Health, Safety, 
Security and Environment - Inspection Monitoring Team (HSSE-IMT)
In order to maintain HSSE best practices, policies and regulations in the operation of the natural 
gas facility, all operators shall comply with the Philippines and internationally accepted safety 
standards and best practices in areas of design and construction, management system, operation 
system, maintenance system, personnel development and training on Community Health and 
Safety Preparedness and Emergency Response. The HSSE standards encourage best practices and 
ensure compliance with international HSSE standards and best practices under a system of safe 
operation, high-quality service and consumer protection.
The JAO intends to enhance the cooperation of the concerned agencies for the effective and wellcoordinated inspection, as well as the respective permitting activities with the appropriate 
standards into each member agency’s regulatory framework. The HSSE-IMT’s members include 
the Department of Interior and Government (DILG), the Department of Environment and Natural 
74 Promulgated through DC 2017-11-0012 issued on 28 November 2017Resources (DENR), the Department of Health (DOH), the Department of Transportation (DOTr), 
the Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA), and the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG).
3. Philippine Downstream Natural Gas Industry 
The DOE conducted a total of 18 pre-application conferences in 2018. In addition, the DOE granted 
the following permits and endorsement to various players in the industry:
Issuance of Permits to the following:
▪ Energy World Corporation (EWC) - Permit to Construct 75
▪ Tanglawan Philippine LNG Inc. - Notice to Proceed (NTP)76
Issuance of Acknowledgement and Endorsement to the following:
▪ Acknowledgement to supply and transport natural gas by SPEX to Pilipinas Shell Refinery 
(PSPC) 
▪ Acknowledgement to supply and transport natural gas by PNOC to PSPC
▪ Seven (7) Endorsements to the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC)
4. Communication Initiative of the Natural Gas Industry
In 2018, the DOE conducted 10 information, education and communication (IEC) campaigns 
focused on natural gas, eight (8) of which were on market profiling of natural gas in various 
Economic Zones. These Economic Zones (i.e. Subic Special Economic and Freeport Zone, Clark 
Special Economic and Freeport Zone) are self-sustaining, progressive and designed as independent 
communities with minimum government interference and favorable entitlements. On the other 
hand, the other two (2) IECs conducted were for the Senate, as well as for the DOE’s Centralized 
Review and Evaluation Committee (C-REC) Secretariat for familiarization with and appreciation of 
existing natural gas facilities and natural gas users. 
5. Legislative Agenda and Policy Advocacy Campaign
The Senate Bill No. 765 or the Downstream Natural Gas Development Bill, once passed into law, 
shall provide a framework for the development of a Philippine Downstream Natural Gas Industry 
(PDNGI). The PDNGI’s transition from an emerging to a mature industry status with competitive 
natural gas market will define the responsibilities of various government agencies and private 
entities in furtherance of this national goal. 
The DOE, in addition to its existing powers and functions, shall have the overall responsibility of 
supervising and monitoring the development of the downstream natural gas industry. This 
responsibility includes regulation of the construction and operation of natural gas pipelines and 
other related facilities for the transmission, distribution and supply of natural gas.
6. Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with University of the Philippines Statistical Center Research 
Foundation Inc. (UPSCRFI)
The DOE signed a MOA with UPSCFR on 07 December 2018 for the implementation of the Gas Policy 
Development Program (GPDP) I through funding support from U.S. Department of State under the 
Enhancing Development and Growth through Energy (EDGE) Program in Asia. In this agreement, 
the UPSCFRI will provide policy recommendations, capacity building activities, and other relevant 
75 Issued on 21 Dec 2018
76 NTP expired in June 2019forms of assistance to the DOE for the evaluation of natural gas investment projects. In addition, 
UPSCFRI will also contribute in crafting of technical, financial, and economic guidelines to be used 
for review and evaluation of LNG related project proposals. The DOE and UPSCFRI also agreed to 
conduct specific research activities together to deliver a clearer and in-depth understanding of the 
LNG industry and other pertinent policies.
B. PLANS AND PROGRAMS
Medium-Term
In the medium-term (Figure 55), the roadmap is expected to advance the country’s emerging 
natural gas industry which is unbundled with various players from retail to wholesale supply 
competition that would result in a reasonable price for natural gas. Likewise, the roadmap aims to 
develop standards, codes of practices and expand the industry’s market reach. All the envisioned 
targets will require policy support and legislation to further the development of the industry. 
1. Standards Development 
With the promulgation of the PDNGR, the DOE will formulate the following PNS or adopt relevant 
international or foreign standards to help the natural gas industry produce quality products and 
services and raise productivity:
Figure 55. DOWNSTREAM NATURAL GAS ROADMAP▪ LNG Facility/Safety Rules/Codes; 
▪ HSSE Standards; 
▪ Inspection Manual;
▪ Transmission Pipeline;
▪ Distribution Pipeline; and,
▪ Natural Gas related ancillary facilities.
The PNS for natural gas industry protects the welfare of the consumers and facilitate trade in the 
global market. The natural gas industry’s domestic development is crucial for transforming the 
Philippines as an LNG trading and trans-shipment hub in the Asia-Pacific Region.
The development of standard for LNG facility and safety rule in the operation of the facility aims to 
provide a harmonized standard procedure in the operation of the LNG facility in the country to 
ensure safety operation to protect people and property. On the other hand, the safety code sets 
the guidelines for safety operations. In formulating these standards, a Technical Working Group 
(TWG) shall be created consisting of industry stakeholders. 
2. Communication Initiatives
Increasing awareness to promote natural gas 
development is vital. The conduct of IEC campaign 
to familiarize stakeholders with the natural gas 
industry is essential. Moreover, crafting 
informational materials will certainly help in market 
development of PDNGI. Likewise, the conduct of 
the study regarding natural gas assessment, 
potential sites, market and database will encourage 
potential investors’ interest in the development of 
the industry. The scope of the said study should 
cover a wide array, such as market survey and 
profiling, excise tax and incentives, utilization and 
pricing, emerging trends and commercial 
application among others. Lastly, by facilitating the 
conduct of pre-application conferences, study and 
assessment of potential natural gas projects by the 
DOE would help the promotion of natural gas 
infrastructure development program to interested 
investors.
3. Sector Regulation
The PDNGR provides the stakeholders with a guide 
that outlines the issuance of permit on the construction, expansion, rehabilitation, modification, 
operation and maintenance of Downstream Natural Gas Facility. The Department created a 
database regarding registry of operators and their natural gas facilities, accreditation of LNG 
importer, technical review and evaluation of permit application of proposed natural gas 
infrastructure projects are among the identified activities in support of the said regulation. 
Simultaneously, natural gas infrastructure monitoring activities and supply development is equally 
important. Facility inspection/validation to ensure compliance by operators on HSSE activities 
during construction, operation and maintenance in cooperation with the HSSE-IMT. Likewise, The 
Site visit to First Gen Clean Energy City PlantPNS requirements on natural gas production, sale, importation, and consumption must also be 
monitored to meet the standard’s quality requirement. Also, DOE will continue to be abreast on
emerging technologies on LNG storage and transport together with upstream activities of the 
sector to come up with improvements on policy, safety, and standards, among others.
4. Legislative Agenda and Policy Advocacy Campaign
Policy and legislative framework support are necessary to accelerate the development of the 
downstream natural gas industry in the country. The development and implementation of policy, 
plans, rules and regulations on natural gas supply security, safety and access is vital to the sector’s 
growth. Such are targeted to be implemented in the medium-term as follows: a) DC on Rules to 
Implement the PNS on Natural Gas Quality; b) HSSE codes and practices; c) JAO to strengthen the 
HSSE-IMT; and, d) Third Party Access (TPA) Rules/Code, and e) PDNGI Development Plan.
In line with the upcoming frameworks of the sector, personnel capacity skills and development are 
essential in order to evaluate project applications. These include all phases of the project from 
securing permits, construction, and maintenance, as well as its commerciality, safety and security. 
In support of this, the DOE personnel’s participation in relevant trainings related to the industry is 
a must. Likewise, continue establishing bilateral partnerships with the academe and other relevant 
organizations, either local and/or international, is beneficial in order to map out regulatory, 
technical and commercial capabilities. Lastly, the creation of a special TWG to provide technical 
support in the evaluation of permit applications would also benefit the DOE to determine the 
feasibility of potential natural gas projects. 
5. Extension of MOA with UPSCRFI for the GPDP II
The GPDP I was able to lay the foundation for the LNG sector by facilitating the capacity 
development of the regulators, such as the DOE-Natural Gas Management Division including the 
members of the HSSE-IMT. Further, the GPDP 1 also initiated to put in place the mechanisms for 
potential LNG imports in preparation for the anticipated depletion of the Malampaya gas field.
With the successful implement of the GPDP I, the U.S. Department of State has favorably 
considered the implementation of the GPDP II to continue the technical assistance and sustain the 
efforts made in the earlier program. The subsequent program aims to operationalize a more 
streamlined process of securing permits and application process by working with partner agencies 
and bureaus apart from the DOE through the HSSE-IMT, promote market development, and 
realization of investment for LNG facilities. It also intends to implement related and associated 
activities towards the development of the country’s downstream natural gas industry. 
Long-Term
As shown in Figure 55, the long-term roadmap goals intend to amend and/or update policies and 
standards to keep up with the global trends and changes. Regulations will be critical for the 
industry to grow. These include investments, compliance to safety from inception to commercial 
operations, and validation and inspection. 
1. Standards development 
With the promulgation of standard and safety codes on natural gas in place, the code of standards 
and safety implementation will be the next step. After which, the PNS/DOE Quality Standards (QS)
011:2016 titled “Petroleum gas – Natural gas – Quality Specification” development and amendment aims to establish a successful natural gas industry. Moreover, the PNS serves as a guide in crafting 
and development of the following to ensure a robust natural gas sector: 
▪ LNG Facility/Safety Rules/Codes;
▪ HSSE Standard;
▪ Inspection Manual;
▪ Transmission Pipeline;
▪ Distribution Pipeline;
▪ Natural Gas related ancillary facilities;
▪ Natural Gas Quality; and,
▪ Transportation and storage of natural gas.
2. Sector Regulation 
The DOE will continue to monitor and regulate 
the industry. With the promulgation and 
implementation of DC 2017-11-0012 titled “Rules 
and Regulation of the Philippine Downstream 
Natural Gas Industry and/or the Natural Gas Law,”
applicants’ submission of required documents of 
proposed natural gas infrastructures will 
undergo technical review and evaluation prior to 
awarding of permits and endorsements (i.e. SEC, 
NTP from the DOE). Similarly, facility 
inspection/validation is equally important to 
ensure compliance by operators on HSSE 
activities during construction, operation and 
maintenance. Likewise, natural gas supply 
development and monitoring activities (e.g. 
production, sales, and consumption) will also be 
pursued during the planning period to come up 
with necessary policies, planning, and programs 
to keep the industry self-sustainable for years to 
come. 
3. Legislative Agenda and Policy Advocacy Campaign
Natural gas related policies formulation and amendments including legislative framework for the 
long-term period will be carried out to support the expansion of gas industry in the country. During 
this timeframe, the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of the Natural Gas Law will need to 
be in place together with various polices (i.e. Rules to Implement the PNS on Natural Gas Facilities, 
HSSE Codes and Practices, Natural Gas Security and/or Contingency Plan) will need to be 
harmonized in accordance with the law. 
Moving forward, the DOE is committed to keep up with international/regional trend as policy 
thrusts in the industry are evolving. It is necessary that the underlying science, engineering, and 
economics are similarly given emphasis (i.e. natural gas value chain, bilateral partnerships, other 
relevant trainings related to natural gas etc.) to effectively assess the implementation of future 
energy policies and programs for the sector. Lastly, the DOE’s bureaus particularly the Oil Industry 
Management Bureau (OIMB), Energy Resource Development Bureau (ERDB), and Energy Policy 
and Planning Bureau (EPPB) will continue to address research and policy gaps in the local energy 
Regular Inspection & Monitoring of Natural Gas Facilities in the 
Philippinessector and push for reforms that will directly benefit our country. The results of research and policy 
development activities will be used to craft energy sector reforms for the benefit of the national 
economy and the welfare of all Filipinos. 
C. INVESTMENT AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES
Potential Investments
One key initiative to develop 
the downstream natural gas 
industry is to encourage 
domestic and private sector 
participation and 
investment in the 
development of the 
required infrastructure, such 
as the LNG Import receiving 
facilities. With the longterm goal of tapping this 
clean energy, the 
government will provide an 
enabling environment to 
encourage greater private 
sector involvement in its 
development, through the 
issuance of the relevant 
policies to improve the 
regulatory framework that 
serves as transparent guidelines for the investors. 
The DOE approved the permits authorizing the development and construction of LNG 
Regasification Terminal projects proposed by different proponents as shown in Table 32. The LNG 
import facility development and construction require huge capital investment from the private 
sector. From these projects, potential investment amounts to PhP 64,632 million. More 
investments are expected for other necessary natural gas infrastructure like satellite terminals, 
transmission and distribution pipelines and refueling stations when demand for natural gas ramps 
up in the near future. 
An LNG import facility in Batangas will provide value proposition since the existing anchor markets 
are available in the area – that is when Malampaya gas field runs dry. Meanwhile, the LNG facility 
in Quezon will be serving the potential markets in the area and nearby provinces. 
Turn-over ceremony of the Philippine Downstream Natural Gas Industry: LNG Investors’ GuideVisayas and Mindanao have also potential to host LNG terminal facilities with prior intents received 
from possible investors (specifically in Mindanao). The study conducted by the Economic Research 
Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) titled “Seeking Optimal Solutions on Delivering LNG to 
Medium and Large Islands in the Philippines” showed that Cebu, Tacloban, Tagbilaran, Zamboanga, 
Iligan, Bislig, Surigao and General Santos City are possible locations for bulk LNG receiving 
terminals. Both Cebu and Zamboanga are suggested as the primary LNG receiving terminals with 
the capacity to redistribute the LNG to other demand centers in southern districts using Floating 
Storage Regasification Unit (FSRU) solutions. Cebu delivers LNG to subordinate (secondary and 
tertiary) terminals in Tacloban and Tagbilaran in the Visayas, and Bislig and Surigao in Mindanao. 
On the other hand, Zamboanga transports LNG to Bislig and General Santos City.
Estimated Jobs Generated 
The proposed LNG regasification and terminal projects are estimated to provide jobs as shown in 
the Table 33. Under the PDNGR, the proponents shall give preference to qualified local talents for 
hiring of manpower required during construction and operation. 
 
Table 33. ESTIMATED JOB GENERATION FROM PROPOSED LNG PROJECTS
Proponent Estimated Jobs
FGEN LNG Corporation 945 during construction and 80 during operation

Operations Philippines Inc 500 during construction and 70 during operation
Batangas Clean Energy, Inc 3,000 during construction and 115 during operation 
More jobs are required during the construction phase of the projects, a total of around 4,5oo 
workers for the proposed facilities. During operation, a total of 325 technical personnel will be 
required to operate the LNG facilities. 
Infrastructure Support
The transportation of natural gas from production to consumption needs an extensive and 
elaborate transportation system. Natural gas produced from the Malampaya gas field has to travel

Note: MTPA stands for Million Ton Per Annumlong distance to reach its point of use. The transportation system for natural gas consists of a 
complex network of pipelines designed to quickly and efficiently transport natural gas from its 
origin to its market. Transportation of natural gas also requires storage if the resource is not 
immediately required. Natural gas liquefaction is a way to move natural gas from producing wells 
to markets. The LNG facilities received natural gas by pipeline and liquefy the gas for transport on 
LNG ships or tankers. Likewise, LNG is transported in smaller containers that can be placed on 
ships and on trucks. The transportation system along with associated facilities offers additional 
job opportunities for the country. 
OIL INDUSTRY
The enactment of Republic Act (R.A.) 8479, otherwise known as the Downstream Oil Industry 
Deregulation Act of 1998 provides the framework and guiding principles of a truly competitive 
market under a regime of fair prices, adequate supply of environmentally clean and high-quality 
petroleum products. 
As stipulated in the said Act, the DOE monitors the quality of petroleum products and compliance 
with the Philippine National Standards (PNS) including refining and manufacturing processes of 
local petroleum products to ensure that clean and safe technologies are applied. The PNS is in 
accordance with R.A. 8749, or the Philippine Clean Air Act, which is a comprehensive air quality 
management policy and program aims to achieve and maintain healthy air for all Filipinos.
The DOE likewise keeps track of the daily international crude oil prices and examines the 
movement of domestic oil prices to prevent market abuses in a deregulated environment. 
Inventory level of crude oil and petroleum products are recorded to determine conformity to the 
minimum inventory requirement (MIR) and the level of domestic supply. Current MIR for refiners 
is in-country stocks equivalent to 30 days, while an equivalent of 15 days stock is required for the 
bulk marketers and seven days for the LPG players.
To achieve the DOE’s goal of improved policy and ensure high quality and right quantity of 
petroleum products in the market, the Department crafted a roadmap to have a clear vision from 
2018 to 2040. The short-term goals of the roadmap are reviewed and assessed to see if strategies 
and indicators were able to meet targets and adjust accordingly to catch-up and reach future 
aspirations. 
Existing Downstream Oil Facilities
The downstream oil infrastructure has 
been increasing at a steady rate with a 
total of 325 industry participants77 in 2018, 
up by almost 14.0 percent from 286 
participant in 2017, with accumulated 
investment of PhP 180.8 billion (since 
1998). These players are engaged in 
various downstream oil business, such as 
fuel bulk and retail marketing, LPG refilling 
and marketing, petroleum transport, 
terminalling and bunkering. 
77 In 2019
industry participants went up to 355 players with total accumulated investment of PhP 1838 billion

comprised 171 facilities, two refineries, 54 import terminals, and 115 depots/distribution networks.
78
 
The refineries contributed 43.0 percent of the total storage capacity, equivalent to 2,322 ML. On 
the other hand, the depots provided 12.9 percent with 695 ML, while import terminals constituted 
44.1 percent of total with 2,380 ML. The Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation owns a refinery 
facility in San Pascual, Batangas, and Petron Corporation’s refinery is located in Limay, Bataan. 
Retail Marketing Business
For retailing activity, there were newly constructed 
retail outlets and at the same time closure and rebranding in 2018 to modernize the facilities and 
services as part of compliance to the issued DC 2017-
11-0011 or the “Revised Retail Rules.” The industry 
reported an increase of 1.0 percent in retail outlets 
operating nationwide, bringing the total number of 
outlets to 8,803
79 as of end 0f 2018. Among the country’s three (3) major islands, Luzon secured 
the greatest number of retail outlets (Table 35).
A. ASSESSMENT
1. Fuel Quality and Facility, And Process Standards Development
The passage of the Philippine Clean Air Act of 1999 (or RA 8749) sets strict fuel specifications to 
reduce emissions that affect air quality. In line with the objectives of the law and the vision of a 
low carbon future, the DOE continuously formulates standards on petroleum fuels and related 
products along with oil facilities to ensure a more stringent quality of fuels and other related 
products in the country. 
The DOE crafted the following downstream oil market, fuel quality and infrastructure standards 
within the short-term planning horizon: 
Fuel Quality Standards
a. PNS/DOE QS 004:2017: Coco-Methyl-Ester (CME) Blended Automotive Diesel Oil80 Specifications. 
The standard specifies the requirement for CME‐blended diesel oil suitable for various types of 
automotive diesel engines. In this edition, the Euro2 fuel grades (500 ppm maximum sulfur 
content) was removed and thus effectively provided only the Euro IV‐PH automotive diesel oil 
grade (50 ppm maximum sulfur content) to align with the emission requirement of DENR under 
DAO 2015‐04 and 2016‐23.
b. PNS/DOE QS 013:2017: CME Blended Industrial Diesel Oil Specifications. The standard indicates 
the requirement for CME‐blended diesel oil suitable for various types of industrial diesel 
engines. In this edition, a new PNS number was created to separate the requirements of 
industrial diesel oil (IDO) from automotive diesel oil (ADO), which carried the original 
designation of PNS/DOEQS004.
78 In 2019, total depots and import terminals grew to 127 and 58, respectively.
79 As of December 2019, the total number retail outlets nationwide reached 9,381.

oils used wholly or as blending component of different grades for various types of fuel oil‐
burning equipment. It is a revision/update of PNS/DOE QS006:2005 with minor revision made 
particularly the deletion of the word “bunker” and referred only as industrial fuel oil, as well as 
updating of test methods.
d. PNS/DOE QS 008:2018: E-Gasoline Specification (E1081). This standard is a revision/update of 
PNS/DOE QS 008:2012. In this edition, the Euro2 fuel grades (500 ppm maximum sulfur content) 
was removed and thus effectively provided only the Euro4‐PH gasoline fuel grades (50 ppm 
maximum sulfur content) to align with the emission requirement of the DENR under 
Department Administrative Orders (DAOs) 2015‐04 and 2016‐23. The standard specifies the 
requirements for bioethanol‐blended gasoline (e‐gasoline) used as fuel in spark‐ignition 
internal combustion engines, excluding aviation gasoline.
e. PNS/DOE QS 014:2018: Residual Marine Fuels Specification. The standard indicates the 
requirements for fuels use in marine diesel engines and boilers, prior to conventional onboard 
treatment (settling, centrifuging, filtration) before use. The specifications for fuels can also be 
applied on fuels used in stationary diesel engines of the same or similar type of those utilized
for marine purposes. In this standard, the statutory requirement for the sulfur content is set at 
3.0 percent, mass, maximum based on PNS for Fuel Oils (PNS/DOE QS 006).
f. PNS for Kerosene (DPNS/DOE QS 009:201982). The standard is a revision/update of PNS /DOE QS 
009:2007 with minor revision made only in the property of color and updating of test methods. 
The standard updates the fuel quality specification in terms of current requirement of the 
industry, its users and manufacturers. It is also harmonized with international/regional 
environmental standards. 
Facilities Standards
a. PNS/DOE Facility Standard (FS) 10:2017: Code of Safety Practices for Liquid Petroleum Product 
(LPP) in Retail Outlet (new) promulgated by the Department of Trade and Industry-Bureau of 
Product Standards (DTI-BPS). The Code of Safety practices is intended for managers/operators 
of LPP Retail Outlet focusing on safety and good practice procedures with reference 
to relevant health and safety standards. 
b. DPNS/FS 2:2018: LPG Refilling Plant (promulgated by DTI-BPS). The standard is a review of 
PNS/DOE 2:2006, which was circulated to all concerned sectors from 13 April-13 June 2018 for 
comments.83 This edition incorporates a new chapter adopting energy resiliency in the 
planning and programming of the energy sector to mitigate potential impacts of disaster. 
c. Handbook on Code of Safety Practices in LPG Refilling Plant. This standard covers the 
requirements for the installation of an LPG refilling plant, including the associated bulk storage 
tank facility and other related equipment and facilities.
d. Code of Safety Practices in LPP Depot84. This Code constitutes good industry practices for oil 
terminals/ depots and is designed to prevent accidents at LPP terminal/ depot facilities and 
ensure product quality.

82 The PNS was promulgated on 23 December 2019. 
83 Adopted on 03 April 2019 with ongoing corrigendum. 
84 Published on 19 September 20192. Supervision and Monitoring
The DOE conducted various inspections and sampling of LPP in several depots/terminals and retail 
outlets nationwide. In line with this core function, the DOE started utilizing its newly procured sets 
of portable instruments in conducting field testing especially in oil depots for more efficient 
product quality monitoring. These activities are part of the DOE’s measures to ensure compliance 
of industry players with existing national standards and to protect the consumers in their purchase 
of petroleum products. In 2018, the DOE carried out the following activities:
▪ Inspected/verified 49 players/storage facilities and retail outlets giving fuel discounts to 
public utility vehicles (PUVs);
▪ Issued inspection reports (IRs) to 2,165 gasoline stations and LPG establishments;
85
▪ Examined 1,515 denaturing activities;
▪ Conducted 113 depot product sampling/ testing;
86 and 
▪ Performed six (6) inspection and monitoring activities in compliance of HSSE program by 
operators. 
3. Communication Initiative of The Downstream Oil Industry
The DOE regularly conducts IECs
to raise awareness and 
disseminate information 
regarding the benefits of and 
process of participation in various 
DOE programs. These IECs 
embody the process of learning 
that empowers people to make 
decisions, modify behaviors and 
change social conditions.
In 2018, the DOE conducted 18 IEC 
activities covering various sub 
sectors of the downstream oil 
industry. Of the total, 18 focused 
on the oil sector -12 of which under 
the safety of LPG projects, while 
the other six were on the overview 
of the downstream oil industry, oil pricing, and investments. 
4. Legislative Agenda and Policy Advocacy 
Campaign
The DOE reviewed and amended several 
existing rules and regulations, crafted a 
Department Order to study the option for a 
strategic petroleum reserve, and improved 
process systems, among others. In 2018-
2019, the DOE drafted and/or promulgated 
the following issuances/policies:
85 The DOE inspected 3,925 out of 16,662 gasoline stations and LPG establishments in 2019. 
86 In 2019
the DOE conducted product sampling/testing for 88 depots nationwide out of 127equivalent to 690 percent area coverage
Nationwide IEC Campaign on Downstream Oil Industry, LPG and LPP safety

2019▪ DC 2018-03-0004 prohibiting the sale and distribution of small-sized 2.7-kg capacity and below 
LPG cylinders without the required “For Outdoor Use Only” marking in addition to the usual 
mandatory markings for LPG cylinders and for other purposes.
▪ Joint Administrative Order (JAO) No. 1 series of 2018 for the distribution and transportation of 
LPG cylinders. The DOE, DILG, DOTr, and Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA)
through the JAO directed all LPG participants to observe the minimum safety standards.
▪ Drafted an Omnibus Circular on notice and reportorial requirements compliance. The Omnibus 
Circular was crafted to improve the quality and timeliness of reports submitted by the industry. 
Further, OIMB aims to unify notice formats for easy monitoring and simple compliance of 
industry players to the notice and reportorial requirements of RA 8479 and RA 9367.
Policies issued in 2019 and 2020
▪ DC 2020-05-0012 issued on 11 May 2020 providing the Guidelines Implementing the Temporary Modification of Import 
Duty Rates on Crude Petroleum Oil and Refined Petroleum Products as Provided Under Executive Order (E.O.) No. 113. 
The Circular promulgates the rules and regulations for the effective implementation of the Executive Order 113, titled 
“Temporarily Modifying the Rates of Import Duty on Crude Petroleum Oil and Refined Petroleum Products under 
Section 1611 Of Republic Act No. 10863, Otherwise Known as the “Customs Modernization and Tariff Act.” It aims to 
provide the guidelines for the reversion to zero percent as international oil prices increase based on trigger prices 
indexed to oil prices in the world market. 
▪ Memorandum Order (MO) 2019– 11–0001 issued on 14 November 2019 directing the Philippine National Oil Company 
(PNOC) to conduct a study for the establishment of a Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) Stockpiling. The MO shall be 
known as the implementing Guideline for the establishment of the Philippine Strategic Petroleum Reserve Program, 
institutionalizing the establishment of a Government-owned oil and/or finished petroleum products reserve program 
to ensure security of supply and cushion the impact of supply interruptions in the world market. The Government, 
through the DOE and PNOC, shall facilitate the immediate implementation of the Philippine Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve Program; hence the issuance of the MO. 
▪ DC 2019-06-0009 issued on 06 June 2019 implements the modified PNS specifications for liquefied petroleum gases 
(PNS/DOE QS 005:2016 and PNS/DOE QS 012:2016). The Circular supersedes previous issuances and effectively 
implements the latest specifications of non-motor fuel LPG as PNS/DOE QS 005:2016 and motor fuel LPG as PNS/DOE 
QS 012:2016. Its objective is to mandate the latest LPG standards for compliance purposes by oil industry players, and 
become the basis for OIMB monitoring on industry compliance. 
▪ DC 2019-05-0008 or the “Revised Guidelines for the Monitoring of Prices in the Sale of Petroleum Products by the 
Downstream Oil Industry in the Philippines” was promulgated on 28 May 2019. Pursuant to the DOE’s mandate on 
efficient data-driven policymaking and in ensuring greater market transparency, the said Circular amends the existing 
DC 2005-08- 007. This policy measure is consistent with the declared policy of the oil deregulation law to ensure a 
competitive market under a regime of fair prices. In addition to the current contents of the notification, added in the 
amended Circular is the Section on Unbundled Price Adjustment, which would provide details on how oil players 
arrived at their pump prices. The implementation, however, of this Circular has been the subject of restraining orders 
issued by different courts in Metro Manila in separate cases filed by major industry players. 
▪ DC 2019-05-0006 issued on 15 May 2019 implementing the Specifications for CME Blended Automotive Diesel Oil 
(PNS/DOE QS 004:2017) and CME Blended Industrial Diesel Oil (PNS/DOE QS 013:2017). The Circular mandates the latest 
auto and industrial diesel standards for compliance purposes by oil industry players and become the basis for OIMB 
monitoring of industry compliance. 
▪ DC 2019-02-0005 on proper retention of duplicate liquid petroleum fuel samples in depots and retail outlets was issued 
on 13 February 2019. The Circular repeals Memorandum Circular (MC) 2001-02-001 to consider also the use of clear glass 
sampling bottle in the product quality monitoring. Further, it provides for the inclusion of depot facilities in the 
requirement of fuel sample retention aside from retail outlets. This is to provide flexibility in accessing sampling bottle 
for fuel quality monitoring purposes, as well as to expand coverage of the requirement on fuel sample retention in 
depot facilities.
▪ DC 2019-02-002 issued on 04 February 2019 implementing the Specifications for E-Gasoline (PNS/DOE QS 008:2018). The 
Circular mandates the latest gasoline standard for compliance purposes by oil industry players and becomes the basis 
for monitoring of industry compliance. Further, there are legislative agenda still pending in Congress for approval, as follows:
Senate Bill No. 85387/House Bill No. 455088
The Bill amends RA 8479 to ensure transparency in the pricing of petroleum products by oil 
industry players and to determine computations or assumptions used in price adjustments to avoid 
unwarranted profiteering. The Bill shall also declare it unlawful for oil companies to engage in 
unwarranted oil price increases, or unreasonable amount of price increase or decrease as may be 
determined by the DOE, coupled with the imposition of heavier penalties against erring oil 
companies and officials. 
To safeguard the consumers, the Bill strengthens the Task Force created under Section 14 (of the 
said Bill), which is mandated to investigate and file complaints against unreasonable rise in the 
prices of petroleum products. The Task Force shall be composed of representatives from the DOE, 
DTI, Department of Justice (DOJ), Commission on Audit (COA), and from consumer and public 
transport groups. The COA, with its auditing and accounting expertise, will fortify the capability of 
the Task Force in scrutinizing financial documents and reports of oil companies. The Task Force 
shall be authorized to post the prevailing retail prices of petroleum products in the DOE website 
(twice a month) and in at least two newspapers of general circulation. 
Senate Bill No. 41389/House Bill No. 302 and No. 564290 or the LPG Industry Safety Bill
The Bill aims to monitor and supervise the business operations of the LPG industry in order to 
ensure safety of the consuming public and protect the general welfare. It intends to establish a 
more efficient and effective monitoring and supervisory framework for refining, importation, 
refilling, transportation, distribution, marketing and sale of LPG. 
Some of the Bill’s provisions are the formulation of appropriate programs and standards for the 
importation, manufacture, sale, distribution, exchange, swapping, repair, requalification and 
rehabilitation of LPG cylinders and other ancillary equipment, such as hoses and valves. The DTI 
as the lead agency will undertake coordinated efforts to monitor and supervise compliance of 
industry participants to the national product quality and safety, environmental and occupational 
safety, and consumer welfare standards.
The Bill proposes the creation of the LPG Industry Monitoring and Inspection Committee, which 
shall formulate the specific guidelines for mandatory compliance with established quality 
standards and enforce sanctions for violations.
B. PLANS AND PROGRAMS
Medium-Term
The DOE will continuously amend and/or revise policies governing the downstream oil sector to 
further encourage private sector participation, meet the industry challenges and keep abreast of 
the international trends. This is to ensure secure and stable supply of high quality and right 
quantity petroleum products in the market. Further, the government’s existing rules and 
regulations must evolve specifically those involving taxation, incentives, and licensing to reassure 
investors of a robust domestic downstream oil industry (Figure 56).

2019DOI Standards Development 
Targets for the medium-term provides specific items to 
be crafted for future promulgation. Meanwhile, facility 
standards will focus on liquid fuel/LPG transport 
facilities and vehicles. The fuel quality and facilities 
standards support the formulation of the standard 
provisions of the Liquid Fuel Industry Rules, as well as 
planned revision on the LPG Industry Rules. Also, the 
draft Downstream Oil Contingency Plan is in the 
development stage to ensure adequate and continuous 
fuel supply in times of supply interruptions due to 
natural disasters. Lastly, the Code of Safety Practices is 
also being developed for LPG refilling plant and 
petroleum products in depots. All these future 
developments shall be pursued to enhance structural 
integrity, improve safety, enable cost reductions and 
reduce the environmental impact of the downstream 
oil industry operations in the country. 
2. Communication Initiatives
The Gasoline Station Lending and Financial Assistance Program’s (GSLFAP) continuous promotion 
encourages retail competition since this would entice investors to construct their own gas stations. 
The GSLFAP is designed to encourage new industry participants from the private sector, transport 
cooperatives, and transport groups. For the medium-term, IECs will focus on safety of LPG and 
liquefied fuels use, revised retail rules, and the E-Power Mo! Campaign. This is the DOE’s way of 
Figure 56. DOWNSTREAM OIL INDUSTRY ROADMAP
DOE conduct testing on samples obtained using DOE 
portable instrumentsraising awareness and empowering end-users to equip them with information regarding the 
downstream oil industry and other energy sectors as well. 
3. Legislative Agenda and Policy Advocacy Campaign
Seeking to promote and enhance public service, the DOE in its medium-term roadmap is focusing 
on improving its process systems (e.g. online application, etc.) to enable stakeholders to transact 
with government with just a click of a button. The said automation of critical business processes 
can digitally transform the DOE’s operations, services, internal communications, and engagement 
with the public. The digital transformation will significantly reduce processing time while greatly 
improving the convenience for stakeholders. 
To improve data on petroleum products importation, a MOA between the DOE and Bureau of 
Customs (BOC) is being crafted. The draft MOA is an initiative to assist both parties in data 
reconciliation on petroleum products and bioethanol importation. The agreement will identify and 
qualify the information that will be used for exchange, set the manner and period of exchange, 
assign the offices that will receive, distribute, collate, and reconcile the information from each 
party, create a reconciliation committee, and guide both parties in enforcement use and 
observation of confidentiality of information. This initiative will help DOE and BOC- Assessment 
and Operations Coordinating Group (AOCG) to reconcile the imports volume of petroleum 
products and bioethanol notified and actually discharged, and consequently be able to assess the 
proper taxes.
The DOE is also looking into the possibility of establishing a Strategic Oil Stockpiling Program 
(SOSP). The Philippines, which imports more than 90.0 percent of its oil requirements, has been 
reeling from the incessant spikes in the oil prices in the world market. 
Long-Term
The implementation of revisions and amendments in the medium-term is critical to realize its 
impact in the long-term. To put forward the sector’s targets on legislative agenda and standards 
development, the DOE will continue to implement amendments of policies in response and 
compliance to amendments made on existing laws, regulations, technology and international 
commitments. With unwavering commitment to protect the interest of the country, the DOE 
continuously safeguards the welfare of the consumers nationwide to ensure that petroleum 
products are of high quality and of the right quantity.
Anchored on the DOE’s mandate to “formulate and implement policies, plans, programs and 
regulations and monitors developments in the downstream oil industry,” most activities identified in 
the roadmap for the long-term include the continuing promotion of the GSLFAP and various IEC 
campaigns regarding the safe transport of LPGs, handling of liquid fuels, and other related matters 
in the industry. Moreover, the program management and monitoring include the oil price 
movements in the local and international setting, conduct of enforcement activities, and the 
process and issuance of permits and endorsement of activities, among others. 
C. INVESTMENT AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES
A total of PhP 8,374.1 million was invested by the new players in various activities in the 
downstream oil industry in 2019 (Table 36). The additional investments provided employment for 
an estimated number of 753 people in various activities. Table 36. INVESTMENT IN OIL FACILITY, 2019 vs 1

Of the total, PhP 6,593.7 million investments came from the construction/expansion projects of 
import terminals in Regions 3 and 4A. The expansion projects employed an estimated of 320 
people. Meanwhile, the investments for the construction of new depots in Pampanga and General
Santos City in Mindanao with total storage capacity of 26.73 million liters totaled PhP 1,224.7 
million. The new depots construction provided jobs for 152 persons. On the other hand, the 
transport facilities engaged in the distribution and hauling poured in PhP 555.7 million investment 
with job generation of 281 persons.
For the 1st half of 2020, new downstream oil industry players invested a total of PhP 1,673 million,
which generated an estimated number of 224 job employment. Of the total investments, PhP 767.7 
million investments came from the continuation of construction of new import terminal in Sariaya, 
Quezon for the storage of various petroleum products. The project provided employment to
around 80 persons. On the other hand, investments for the construction of new depots in 
Camarines Sur and Davao Del Norte totaled at PhP 766 million and employed an estimated number 
of 98 persons. In addition, investments for the transport facilities engaged in distribution and 
hauling activities totaled PhP 139.3 million and provided jobs for about 40 persons.
Retail Marketing Business
The business environment in retail marketing has seen steady growth with the continuous entry of 
investors in the liquid fuel and LPG industries. A total of 84 new players were accounted bringing 
the total LPP industry players to 9,381 in 2019. Meanwhile, with five (5) new entrants in the LPG 
industry in South Luzon, there were already 297 Refilling Plants. The new entrants poured in a
combined investment of over PhP 250 million (Table 37).

Notably, with the construction of new facilities, 460 individuals were gainfully employed. This was 
seen to have contributed to the economic and social development in the areas where the facilities 
operate.
In the first quarter of 2020, two additional LPP and LPG facilities were constructed giving 
employment to 15 individuals. The same facilities have total investment costs of over 50 Million.91
91 LPP Retail and LPG refilling investments data 1Q of 2020Infrastructure Support
The downstream oil sector relies heavily on the transport industry support in moving large volumes 
of petroleum products across the country. There are four (4) primary methods for transporting
petroleum products – pipeline, train, oil tankers and trucks. To support the upstream and 
downstream sectors, the need for more distribution infrastructure is important in moving 
petroleum products from the refineries, ports and depots to retail outlets and markets all over the 
country. The construction of expressways, bridges, local ports and depots will help accelerate the 
delivery of petroleum products in the retail market. The distance and variety of transportation 
modes used can increase the risk of contamination for the refiners that must maintain strict 
product specifications. Transport cost also affects petroleum product prices. Thus, adequate 
distribution of infrastructures must be put in place to enable industry players to comply with 
environmental regulations and reduce cost. This will result in cleaner and more stringent product 
characteristics and reduce petroleum products price that will benefit consumers and environment.
The Oil Industry and the TRAIN Law 
On 19 December 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte signed RA 10963 or the “Tax Reform for 
Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN Law).” The Act amends and repeals certain provisions of the 
previously amended RA No. 8424 (the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997). Included in the 
Law is the increase in excise taxes of petroleum products, thus, the active involvement of the DOE
in its implementation.
A. The Tax Table
The Law took effect on 01 January 2018, and the excise tax was implemented in three tranches, 
from 2018 to 2020, as illustrated in Table 38. By 2020, the full amount of tax affected all products.
B. Methodology Implemented to Protect the Consumers
Advisory to the oil industry. While the implementation of the excise tax was on 01 January of each 
year, the application of such would depend on the levels of inventory (and the corresponding daily 
Table 38. IMPACT OF EXCISE TAX ON PETROLEUM 
PRODUCTSwithdrawals in their depots) of the oil refiners and bulk importers as of 31 December of the 
preceding year, which were taxed with the old excise rates. Accordingly, the DOE issued advisories 
to the oil players before the yearly implementation to ensure and advise their dealers that pump 
prices should only reflect stocks that have the new excise tax imposed. Old stocks should be sold 
on the old excise rate or at zero rate for diesel, kerosene, fuel oil and LPG.
The DOE Directive on TRAIN implementation. The DOE, in each year of implementation, issued to 
oil companies in early January, the Directive calling for the following:
▪ Submission of a duly notarized inventory report as of 31 December of the preceding year. 
Implementation of the excise tax under TRAIN shall not be applied unless the 31 December 
stocks of finished products are fully exhausted.
▪ For effective monitoring, the inventory shall be on per depot and per product basis. 
▪ Submission of the daily summary of withdrawal starting 01 January of the following year until 
the depletion of the declared inventory as of 31 December, supported by the Withdrawal 
Certificates. 
▪ Retailers to post in a conspicuous area, for transparency, notice of new excise tax 
implementation under the TRAIN in a signage measuring 1 meter by 1 meter in size.
Verification of the submitted reports. The verification focused on the levels of inventory per depot 
vis-à-vis the withdrawals to properly gauge the depletion date and for proper application of the 
new tax scheme in the retail sector. 
Actual monitoring of the retail outlets. During the first tranche of implementation, the DOE 
responded to initial reports of early implementation by some LPP retail outlets pending receipt of 
the documents instructed for submission as specified in the Directive. Thus, Show-Cause Orders
(SCOs) were issued to several outlets directing them to explain in writing, within five days from its 
receipt, why they have already imposed the excise tax, and to include supporting documents to 
substantiate the imposition of the correct excise tax. Validation of documents submitted ensued, 
though not for the whole industry given the immense number of retail outlets nationwide, and 
those validated were found to be compliant in their implementation of the new tax scheme.
C. Savings for Consumers: Estimate of excise tax prevented from being improperly imposed.
The efforts by the DOE helped the customers in saving billions of pesos, thereby ensuring that the 
imposition of the new excise tax rates on petroleum products under the TRAIN Law in the industry 
is fairly and responsibly implemented by all the participants. 
The DOE estimated that its actions saved consumers around PhP 7.96 billion for liquid petroleum 
fuels, and PhP 591.65 million from LPG after the three tranches of implementation. Such was based 
on submitted inventory and daily summary of withdrawals reports of the oil companies in 
compliance with the DOE directive as explained above. 
To validate whether the implementation of the TRAIN Law was proper, the DOE closely examined 
the supply chain, starting with the dates of the source depot run-out vis-à-vis the implementation 
dates of price increases due to TRAIN, including checking of submitted delivery invoices. The 
delivery dates of the excised products were then compared to the implementation dates of the 
price increase in the outlet or gas station involved.BIOFUELS
The growing concerns on energy security and environmental sustainability have stirred countries 
across the world to explore alternative clean sources of energy, including biofuels. Global 
prospects for biofuel production as an alternative to petroleum is seen to substantially contribute 
to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction in the future.
Countries in Southeast Asia have continuously advancing the development of biofuels by 
increasing the blend rates with petroleum (bioethanol for gasoline and biodiesel for diesel) 
supported with comprehensive policies and programs that are in place (Figure 57).
Thailand introduced its 
first 2.0 percent biodiesel 
blend rate (B2)
92 and
voluntary use of 5.0 
percent bioethanol blend 
rate (E5) in 2007, which 
increased to the 
mandated B5 and E10 in 
2016 and subsequently
started implementing 
B6.5-B7 a year later along 
with price incentives on 
using E20. Thailand plans 
to further increase its 
biodiesel blend rate to B10
by 2020 and is also eyeing 
to implement B2093 for 
buses and trucks. 
Indonesia has also set an 
ambitious target of B30 
by 2020 and E20 by 2025

Figure 57. ASEAN MEMBERS WITH EXISTING COMPREHENSIVE POLICIES ON BIOFUEL
Source: The ASEAN Postthrough a Ministerial Regulation No. 12/2015. On the other hand, Malaysia introduced the 
mandated B5 in 2014 and expanding further its mandated B7 in 2015 to B10 in 2019. The 
implementation of B20 biodiesel mandate is still pending. Malaysia has no program on bioethanol 
due to lack of domestic feedstock industry support.
Vietnam is also looking towards utilizing biofuels to sustain its energy needs in the transport sector 
and has been encouraging the production and consumption of B5 and E5 for domestic use. It
started implementing B10 in 2018 and currently conducting large-scale on-road test for B25 and 
E25. 
At the domestic front, the
mandated B2 and E10 are 
being enforced. The 
initiatives of increasing the 
blend rates for biofuels form 
part of the DOE’s long-term
undertaking. Pursuing further 
the development of biofuels 
has been one of the ongoing 
activities of the DOE in 
compliance with Republic Act 
(RA) 9367 or the Biofuels Act 
of 2006. As of 201894, there 
are 11 biodiesel and 12 
bioethanol accredited 
producers in the country as 
shown in Figure 58 with total 
production capacity of 574.9 
million liter per year (Mlpy) and 380.5 Mlpy, respectively.
A. ASSESSMENT
1. Biofuel Production
With the current B2 blend for biodiesel and E10 for bioethanol, the actual production for biodiesel 
increased by 9.8 percent, from 220.0 Mlpy in 2018 to 241.5 Mlpy in 2019, while 16.7 percent increase 
was recorded for the production of bioethanol, with 296.5 Mlpy in 2018 to 346.1 Mlpy in 2019. 
Table 39. BIOFUELS PRODUCTION

Bioethanol 12 380.5 296.54 303.73 346.14 355.55
The DOE also facilitated the establishment of two (2) bioethanol distilleries, Victorias Milling 
Company, Inc. and Progreen Agricorp Inc. (Balayan), and one (1) capacity expansion of Kooll 
Company Inc., from its existing capacity of 14.12 to 30.0 Mlpy in 2018. These new facilities have 
combined capacity of 98.38 Mlpy making the total bioethanol production capacity to 380.5 Mlpy. 
94 In 2019, one (1) biodiesel production facility, Archemicals Corporation, was awarded with Certificate of Accreditation under RA 9367 with a rated 
annual capacity of 33 million litersbringing the total biodiesel production capacity to 6079 Mlpy
Figure 58. EXISTING BIOFUELS PRODUCERS (2018)2. Social Amelioration and Welfare Program (SAWP)
In accordance with Section 17 of the Biofuels Act, the SAWP has been institutionalized where 
biofuel producers contribute a corresponding “lien”95 per liter of biodiesel and bioethanol 
produced and sold. Currently, a lien of PhP 0.05 per liter of coco methyl ester (CME)-based 
biodiesel, PhP 0.19 per liter of sugarcane-based bioethanol, and PhP 0.07 per liter of molassesbased bioethanol are being imposed by the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). Under 
the SAWP, qualified biofuel workers are able to avail various assistance, such as for livelihood, 
training, education, social protection and welfare, and emergency. 
As of 31 December 2018, a total of PhP 53.5 Million was collected from the CME producers, while
PhP 10.2 million was generated from sugarcane-based bioethanol producers and PhP 44.8 million
from molasses-based. Of the amount collected, 95.0 percent is allocated for Socio-Economic 
Project Fund (SEPF) and 5.0 percent for Administrative Expense Fund (AEF).
3. Research and Development for Non-Power
There are other alternative biofuel feedstock sources that can be tapped and harnessed to address 
the issue on supply sustainability. Implementation of higher blend may also be hastened through 
the development of indigenous biofuel feedstock. In the case of the biodiesel, feedstock sources 
are: (a) jatropha, (b) waste cooking oil, (c) microalgae, and (d) rubber seed oil. While for 
bioethanol, feedstock sources include: (a) sweet sorghum, (b) cassava, (c) microalgae, (d) nipa 
sap, and (e) cellulosic materials, among others.
In 2017, the DOE, in coordination with the Department of Science and Technology-Philippine 
Council for Industry, Energy and Emerging Technology Research and Development (DOSTPCIEERD), the Technological University of the Philippines–Integrated Research and Training Center 
(TUP-IRTC), and the University of the Philippines–National Center for Transportation Studies (UPNCTS) initiated the conduct of an actual on-road using B596 and employing dedicated test vehicles 
(Toyota Innova and Hilux) procured in 2014. The test completed the 13,431-km (Hi-Lux) and 14,234-
km (Innova) distance covering flat and high altitude/elevated terrains with varying weather 
conditions. Initial results showed a mileage increase of about 10.0 percent for B5 as compared to 
B2. However, the DOE needs to complete the remaining 16,596 kilometers for a more conclusive 
result on mileage savings.
B. PLANS AND PROGRAMS
Several developmental issues encountered by the industry contributed to the delays in the biofuel 
sector’s roadmap. It has always been a continuing challenge for the industry to sustain the level of 
production and supply to meet the growing demand, particularly on increasing the mandated 
biofuels blend rate.
The rise in demand of biofuels is always paralleled with the rise in demand for feedstock. The 
sustainability of feedstock, such as sugarcane and coconut oil for bioethanol and biodiesel 
production, respectively, poses a challenge for the industry specifically on the issue of food 
security and pricing. There is also a concern related to potential impact of higher biofuels blend to 
current vehicle fleet. 
95 Lien refers to the levy collected from the production of biofuels (with different feedstock sources) to support the SAWP for biofuels plant workers. 
96 5
0 percent biodiesel blendPricing is a major factor that challenges the stability of the domestic biofuel industry with relatively 
higher per liter price of local biodiesel and bioethanol than gasoline and diesel. Thus, this affects
the pump price of the transport fuel,which further makes higher blends more expensive. However, 
it should be noted that biofuels improve compliance of vehicles to existing emission standards.
The National Biofuel Board (NBB) deems it necessary to address these issues through a holistic 
analysis as the basis in finalizing a decision to increase biofuel blends.
Consistent with the objectives of the Biofuels Act, the DOE continuously conducts the following:
▪ Regular monitoring, inspections, validation and evaluation of existing and proposed 
biofuels/biomass projects and facilities nationwide, and sampling laboratory testing of biofuels 
in all biofuel production facilities and feedstock production areas and biofuel-blended gasoline 
and diesel in all blending/distribution facilities;
▪ Research and development activities and studies on biofuels, biofuel-blended gasoline and 
diesel, and/or other biomass-derived fuels for use in motors and engines including air transport 
and other vehicle technologies. Thus, continuance of actual on-road and performance testing 
for B5 and the implementation of research/demonstration projects using alternative 
feedstock; and, 
▪ Encourage investments and provide fiscal incentives to entities engaged in the production of 
biofuels and biofuels feedstock. 
BIOFUELS ROADMAP
While maintaining the current blend for 
biodiesel (B2) and bioethanol (E10) until 
2019, the DOE along with NBB and other 
stakeholders will revisit the biofuel blend 
requirements and available feedstock. 
Continuous research study and 
development on potential feedstock 
sources will also be conducted. 
An economic impact study relating to GDP 
need to be updated if the mandated 
biodiesel blend (B2) increases to B5 by 2020. 
The study will assess the economy-wide 
impacts of biodiesel expansion on 
household welfare, other sectors of the 
economy, rural development, employment 
and income generation, which redound to 
better energy supply security, and incremental growth in the economy. Higher blend rate can 
intensify agriculture production and agriculture crop prices. 
A sensitivity analysis will also be conducted for the determination of the break-even price per 
kilogram of copra and per liter of coconut oil. This could be evaluated if the mill gate / farm gate 
prices of copra to CME are reasonably competitive and beneficial to the farmers. Further 
deliberation on price and its effect on the final pump price will also be considered. 
Figure 59. BIOFUELS ROADMAPExpansion / Production Target
In addition to the production capacity of the existing 12 biodiesel producers in the country, four (4) 
additional facilities are foreseen to be operational by 2020-2025 with combined capacity of 397.65
Mlpy (Table 40). With continued R&D and resource assessment, additional 400 Mlpy is targeted for 
the long-term period.

Corporation from 30 to 45 Mlpy) are likely to be added by 
2020 from the existing capacity of the 12 accredited 
bioethanol producers. Further, the Cavite Biofuels 
Producers, Inc. with 38 Mlpy capacity is expected to be 
online by 2021. The amendment of rated production 
capacities of some of the existing bioethanol producers is 
also projected to provide additional aggregated 
capacities of 56 Mlpy until the year 2025 due to 
progressive optimization of bioethanol plant production 
and additional feedstock supply. For the period 2030-2040, possible additional capacity can reach 
400 Mlpy based on available feedstock (Table 41). 
C. INVESTMENT AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES
The biofuel industry also provides opportunities for livelihood and increase rural employment and 
income. The construction of new biofuel facilities and capacity expansion projects during the 
planning period requires a total investment of PhP 922.4 billion while creating jobs of more than 
120,000. By 2040, it is expected that 51 biofuel producers with total production capacity of 2,205
Mlpy will be operating throughout the country.

*Existing CapacityRENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS
The government’s regulatory framework on renewable energy (RE) development provides the
platform for growth of indigenous clean energy sources in the country. The promulgation of RA 
9513 or the Renewable Energy Act of 2008 establishes a wide range of measures and strategies to 
further drive the development of the RE industry sector. 
Key actions to strengthen policies and 
program framework remain a priority 
thrust of government to stimulate RE 
development and foster innovation on 
technology advancement. Consistent 
with this, the DOE formulated and 
updated the National Renewable 
Energy Program (NREP) and the
implementing Roadmap to serve as 
guideposts for a country-wide approach 
to achieve the aspirational goal of 
increasing the installed RE capacity to at 
least 20,000 MW by 2040. This goal is 
expected to sustainably improve the 
energy supply security, mitigate the 
effects of climate change and catalyze 
rural development. 
An affirmation of the government’s 
ardent efforts in exhausting the full 
potential of renewable resources are
the number of commercially operating 
RE facilities in the country (Figure 60).
As of 2018, the 148 RE facilities provided
a total of 7,226.4 MW97 (both on- and 
off-grid), equivalent to 30.3 percent of 
the country’s total generating capacity. 
Hydro and geothermal contributed bulk of these capacities with 3,700.9 MW and 1,944.0 MW, 
respectively. On the other hand, solar and wind capacities expanded significantly over a 10-year 
period. Solar capacity increased to 896 MW in 2018 from only 1 MW in 2008, while wind capacity 
rose to 427 MW from 33 MW for the same period. 
A. ASSESSMENT
Progress has been made on the short-term targets (2017-2018) of the RE roadmap in terms of the 
number of achievements and completed activities as discussed below. 
1. Accelerated RE Position
The government’s forefront policies on RE, coupled with the unwavering efforts from the private 
sector have secured critical investment for the development of renewables since the 
implementation of the RE Act. Completion of development contracts has resulted in an aggregate 
97 In 2019
total RE capacity reached 7399 MWAdditional capacities came from solar and biomass
Figure 60. EXISTING RE FACILITIES (2018)additional capacity of 2,150 MW 
from renewables (Figure 61). 
About 40.0 percent of 
additional capacity came from 
solar, while wind and hydro 
contributed around 19.0 percent 
each of total. Biomass and 
geothermal added 8.0 – 10.0 
percent to renewable capacity. 
To further attract investments 
and encourage greater 
deployment of more 
renewables, the DOE issued and 
promulgated the following rules 
and guidelines: 
▪ Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) for On-Grid (Department Circular/ DC 2017-12-0015) issued 
on 22 December 2017. The RPS is a market-based policy mechanism under the RE law that 
requires load-serving entities to source an agreed portion of their energy supply from eligible 
RE facilities.
▪ Rules and Guidelines Governing the Establishment of the Green Energy Option Program 
(GEOP) (DC 2018-07-0019) issued on 18 July 2018, which provides end-users the option to 
choose RE resources as their source of energy.
▪ Rules and Guidelines Governing the Establishment of Renewable Portfolio Standards for OffGrid Areas (DC 2018-08-0024) issued on 24 August 2018.
▪ Establishment and Development of Competitive Renewable Energy Zones (CREZ) (DC 2018-
09-0027) issued on 13 September 2018, which covers upgrading and expanding transmission 
facilities through policy initiatives and activities that shall enable the optimal use of the 
indigenous RE resources of the country.
▪ Adopting the Guidelines for the Operationalization of the Renewable Energy Trust Fund 
(RETF) (DC 2018-10-0018) issued on 23 October 2018. The RETF shall be used to finance 
research, development, demonstration, and promotion of the widespread and productive use 
of RE systems both for power and non-power applications.
The Feed-in-Tariff (FiT) scheme for biomass and run-of-river hydro, which expired in 2017 was
extended for two years (2018-2019) or until fully subscribed. This is for the purpose of completing 
the installation targets of the remaining unsubscribed – 29.4 MW for biomass and 105.4 MW for 
run-of-river hydro (as of 31 March 2020). Private entities have ample time to invest in the energy 
sector and deploy additional power supply utilizing renewables. In 2019, the DOE issued 
Certificates of Endorsement to ERC for FiT Eligibility of four hydropower projects with a total 
capacity of 32.18 MW and seven (7) biomass projects with an aggregate capacity of 70.35 MW.
Through the conduct of detailed technology and resource assessment, the DOE was able to 
identify frontier areas for RE development. In 2018, two areas in Quezon Province and five (5) 
areas in Nueva Viscaya were assessed for hydropower potential resource. Meanwhile, the two 
areas identified as candidates for the conduct of detailed wind resource assessment include
Figure 61. RE CAPACITIES INSTALLED (2008-2018), MWBarangay Caragsacan in Dingalan Aurora and Barangay Sinisian East in Lemery Batangas. 
Continuous data collection to validate the initial collected wind data using Sonic Detection and
Ranging (SODAR) equipment will be undertaken in the following areas:
1. Brgy. Poblacion, Pantabangan, Nueva Ecija;
2. Brgy. Malasin, San Jose City, Nueva Ecija;
3. Brgy. Malacapas, Dasol, Pangasinan;
4. Brgy. Ibis, Bagac, Bataan; and,
5. Brgy. Puro, Magsingal, Ilocos Sur.
2. Conducive Business Environment
In line with government’s initiative on the Ease of Doing Business Act98 (RA 11032), the DOE further 
improved transparency and shorten the processing time for the issuance of RE service contracts 
and permits. This helps unleash the full potential of private sector investments for renewable 
energy. 
Setting the progressive pace for RE developers, the DOE revised the existing guidelines and 
procedures governing the awarding and administration of Renewable Energy Service/Operating 
Contracts (RESCs/REOCs), and providing for the Registration Process of Renewable Energy 
Developers. From 45 working days, the processing period has been reduced to not more than 25 
working days.
This was supported with the issuance of the DC 2019-10-0013 on 1 October 2019 promulgating the 
Omnibus Guidelines governing the awarding and administration of RE contracts and the 
registration of RE developers. Under the Circular, renewable projects for own-use and/or for noncommercial purposes shall not require the issuance of RE Contracts, but shall only comply with the 
registration requirements as provided in the Circular.

Duterte signed Republic Act (RA) 11032 or the “Ease of Doing Business Act” on 28 May 2018
Policies issued in 2019 and 2020
▪ Promulgating the Omnibus Guidelines governing the awarding and administration of RE contracts and the 
registration of RE developers (DC 2019-10-0013) issued 01 October 2019. Under said DC, RE projects for own-use 
and/or RE projects for Non-Commercial Purposes shall not require the issuance of RE Contracts but shall comply 
with the registration requirements provided under the Circular.
▪ Promulgating the Renewable Energy Market Rules (DC 2019-12-0016) issued on 04 December 2019.This establishes 
the market for the trading of RE Certificates (RECs) between and among trading participants.
▪ Guidelines on the Duty-Free Importation and monitoring of the utilization of RE machinery, equipment, materials 
and spare parts and their transfer and other disposition (DC 2020-02-0005) issued on 13 February 2020.
▪ Guidelines governing the issuance of Operating Permits to RE Suppliers under the GEOP (DC 2020-04-0009) issued 
on 22 April 2020, which sets rules and procedures in the issuance, administration, and revocation of GEOP Operating 
permits to RE suppliers.
▪ The Green Energy Auction Program (GEAP) (DC 2020-07-0017) issued on 14 July 2020. It sets the framework for 
which the DOE shall facilitate the procurement of supply from RE projects by the mandated participants under the 
RPS on-grid rules through a competitive process for compliance with the RPS program and as applicable for their 
long-term power supply requirements.Recognizing that expeditious realization of energy projects aids economic progress, the Executive 
Order (EO) 30 has been issued declaring some energy projects as “Energy Projects of National 
Significance (EPNS). As of December 2019, 16 RE projects were endorsed and awarded with a 
Certificate of EPNS as indicated in Table 43.
Complementing the EO 30 is the “Energy 
Virtual One Stop Shop (EVOSS) Act” or 
Republic Act (RA) 11234. Prospective 
developers, including RESC holders can 
apply, monitor, and receive all needed 
permits and applications, submit all 
documentary requirements, and even pay 
for charges and fees through this online 
system platform. 
Moreover, 275 Certificate of Endorsements 
(COE) for duty-free importation were also issued to RE developers to lower the investment cost. 
As part of the DOE’s promotional strategy and to incentivize local technology producers, the DOE

3. Reliable and Efficient Infrastructure
Since the country is vulnerable to natural calamities, energy facilities and infrastructures should be 
made stronger to withstand the adverse effects in the energy system. In view of this, the DOE 
issued DC 2018-01-0001 adopting energy resiliency in the planning and programming of the energy 
sector to mitigate potential impacts of disasters. The policy aims to: (1) strengthen existing 
infrastructure facilities; (2) implement the “build back better” principle in terms of reconstruction 
and rehabilitation; (3) improve existing operational, maintenance and practices to ensure 
continuous operations and energy supply; and, (4) develop resiliency standards as bases for future 
construction of energy facilities.
In compliance to the DC, all energy industry participants need to submit their respective Resiliency 
Compliance Plans (RCPs) to the DOE containing adaptation measures, which include both 
structural and non-structural measures options. This is to gauge infrastructure and human resource 
preparedness during and in the aftermath of disruptive events. In 2018, a total of 94 RE industry 
participants submitted their RCPs coming from 12 geothermal projects, 60 hydropower projects, 
13 wind projects, and nine (9) solar projects.
To further strengthen resiliency of the RE systems, some projects have been proposed, among 
which are:
▪ Adoption of Solar-Powered Emergency Shelter Solution (SPESS) as an Energy Resilience Tool 
for Natural Disaster Relief in the Philippines Project; and,
▪ Adoption of Resilient Solar Energy Solution for Calamity Susceptible Areas Project (RESCUE).
4. Promote and Enhance Research, Design and 
Development (RD&D) Agenda
Non-Power
Research and development on other alternative 
biofuel feedstock sources including second 
generation biofuels is a continuing undertaking of 
the DOE. The second-generation biofuels, also 
known as advanced biofuels, are feedstock that 
can be manufactured from various types of nonfood biomass.
Power
Implementation of demonstration project using 
biomass gasification technology for household 
electrification has also been pursued. The 18.0-kW 
Biomass Gasifier Demonstration Project in Sitio 
Bagong Silang, Barangay Alad, Romblon, Romblon 
has already completed its testing and commissioning and now operational since November 2018.
The gasifier was specifically designed for the locally available feedstock, such as bana grass, 
coconut husk and shell.

There has been a growing global call urging governments and financial institutions to increase 
investments on renewables as clean sources of energy to reduce the risks from burning fossil fuels 
affecting human health and environment. Increasing the share of renewables allows the 
displacement of carbon-intensive energy sources, and thus reduces GHG emissions, while 
sustaining the country’s energy supply base.
In support of this goal, the government has set forth a national commitment to intensify the use 
of renewable energy resources as a major policy. The DOE has been encouraging private entities 
to mobilize more investments for the development of renewable resources and technologies. To 
strategically guide prospective investors, the DOE has updated the National Renewable Energy 
Program (NREP) and revised the RE Roadmap containing the targets and deliverables necessary to 
further progress the expansion of renewables in the energy system.
NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY PROGRAM (NREP) 2020-2040
The draft NREP provides an indicative interim capacity targets for each RE technology within the 
new timeframe covering 2020 to 2040 to reach the total aspirational RE capacity target of more 
than 30,000 MW by 2040 (from the original target of 15,304 MW of installed capacity by 2030). The 
program foresees that an additional 20,000 MW capacity is expected to be mainstreamed and 
integrated into the grid on top of existing RE capacity. These capacities have been incorporated in 
the energy outlook as discussed in Chapter II of the PEP. The National Renewable Energy Board 
(NREB) is currently finalizing the NREP 2020-2040 for endorsement to the DOE.
New capacities of 1,453 MW, in addition to the existing geothermal capacity of 1,906 MW, are seen 
to be installed within the planning period bringing the total capacity to 3,359 MW by 2040. This is 
based on the inventory and assessment of geothermal resource, as well as from research and 
studies on geothermal potentials in the country. 
A total of 13,440 MW additional capacities from hydropower resources are likewise expected to be 
in place by 2040. Of the total, Luzon hosts 10,722 MW, Visayas claims 894 MW, and Mindanao holds 
1,824 MW. The target capacity additions are dependent on the development and completion of 
identified hydropower potentials in the medium- to long-term period. 
The awarded biomass operating contracts (as of December 2017) indicate that new capacities 
totaling 1,305.7 MW is foreseen to be added in the energy system within the planning horizon. 
About 192.0 MW of biomass projects are to be installed in the short-term period (2018-2020), 313.4 
MW in the medium-term (2021-2025), and 800 MW in the long-term. 
National Renewable Energy Program 2020-2040Resulting from the resource assessment and awarded service contracts, wind capacity is likely to 
increase by 1,337.7 MW. On the other hand, the capacity target of 11,070 MW for solaris anticipated 
from existing awarded service contracts, committed and indicative projects. 
A Shift on RE Perspective
The NREP 2020-2040 also introduces a paradigm shift on renewables wherein it categorizes RE 
systems into three (3) main baskets refocusing towards a consumer-centered use from the then 
grid-centered approach.
1. Consumer + RE Systems. It encourages the development of RE systems to be utilized by 
the consumers in the agriculture, fisheries, health, and education. This basket aims to 
maximize the integration of battery and other energy storage systems, as well as the use 
of information and communications technology (ICT).
2. Consumer + RE Systems + Distribution Utility (DU). This basket aims to promote 
investments in the Net Metering Program, demand-side participation schemes and 
distributed energy systems through innovative, technical, and commercial approaches. 
3. Consumer + RE Systems + DU + System and Market Operations. This facilitates and 
improves compliance to the RPS, GEAP, RE Rules, GEOP and smart grid policy, among the 
other systems and policies.
RE ROADMAP
Moving towards the realization of the NREP goals, the DOE has intensified the strategies and 
implementing mechanisms as reflected in the revised RE Roadmap (Figure 62), which encompasses 
medium-to long-term period. The Roadmap encapsulates new policy directions and programs that 
need to be institutionalized and strengthened including the positive stance on new initiatives. It 
seeks to provide an inclusive approach to mainstream the targeted 20,000 MW RE capacity by 
2040.
1. Accelerate RE Positioning
With government pursuing its commitment to accelerate the position of RE into a higher level, 
enforcement and fast tracking of all policy mechanisms as required under the RE Law should be 
put in place to fully realize objectives of the Law. Upcoming issuances to strengthen RE 
development include: (a) Renewable Energy Safety, Health and Environment Rules and 
Regulations (RESHERR) Code of Practice; (b) Operational Guidelines for the RE Trust Fund; (c) 
NREP 2020-2040; (d) Guidelines for RE Suppliers under GEOP; (e) Enhanced Net Metering; (f) Green 
Energy Pricing; and, (g) Updated Guidelines on the Duty-Free Importation and monitoring of the 
utilization of RE machineries, equipment, materials and spare parts.The DOE also recognizes that streamlining of existing guidelines and procedures for the awarding 
and administration of RESCs/REOCs and registration process of RE developers will facilitate 
expeditious implementation of RE projects. This also includes the governing guidelines for the 
development, registration and administration of all distributed and small-scale renewable energy 
projects and facilities. 
Continued assessment of renewable resources and regular updating of RE database remain to be 
part of the long-term strategy of the DOE to improve prospective investors’ access to data and
information on the country’s renewable potentials. This also facilitates the mapping of new 
potential renewable resources in the country.
2. Creation of a Conducive Business Environment
As discussed above, the “Ease of Doing Business Act,” EO30 and EVOSS demonstrate the 
government’s commitment t0 providing a conducive environment for investors, making doing 
business in the country easier and faster. These policies remove bureaucratic red tape and 
eliminate corrupt practices. 
With improved and streamlined processes in the issuance of RESCs/REOCs and other required 
permits and clearances, the development of RE projects shall move forward without delays, and 
thus encourages more investments. A reduced processing time for securing permits and 
clearances trims down transaction cost leading to lowering of investment cost. From these 
policies, RE projects shall be expected to be commercially available as scheduled. 
Figure 62. RENEWABLE ENERGY ROADMAP3. Reliable and Efficient Infrastructure
It is the primary focus of the DOE to continuously improve the reliability, availability, and resilience 
of energy infrastructure and facilities in the countryside. As such, it is the policy of the DOE to 
incorporate energy resiliency in the planning and programming of the energy sector as part of its 
long-term strategies in mitigating the potential impacts of disasters. 
Also forming part of the DOE’s medium- to long-term strategy is the intensification of RESHERR
Code of Practice to all RE operators. This is to ensure safety and protection against hazards to 
health, life and property, as well as pollutions (air, land and water) from all RE projects.
4. Promote and Enhance Research, Design and Development Agenda
The DOE continues to explore and conduct research development studies on RE technologies,
including the viability of new technologies. This is one of the government’s strategic approach to 
further expand the share of renewables in the energy supply mix to fuel the country’s 
industrialization and urbanization, while simultaneously being mindful of its environmental 
responsibility. 
Further, the DOE will promote an innovation culture through supporting new and emerging 
renewable technologies, as well as innovative business models in the renewable energy industry. 
Research studies on acidic fluids, low-to-medium temperature/enthalpy and geothermal heat 
pump will be the focus in the medium-term plan (2019-2022). Corresponding policy guidelines for 
the development of low-to-medium enthalpy geothermal energy resources for small-scale power 
generation, agro-industrial and direct use/non-power application will also be undertaken. 
To strengthen partnership with Affiliated Renewable Energy Centers (ARECs), the DOE facilitated
the amendment of Department Order (DO) 2013-12-0019100 through the issuance of DO 2019-03-
0007. This is to streamline the criteria, requirements, process of selecting and establishing ARECs, 
which shall be need-driven and conducted in a competitive and cost-effective manner. 
5. Other Activities
Enabling policy guidelines on the utilization of geothermal energy for direct use/non-power 
applications will also form part of the medium-term plan. The conduct of Information, Education 
and Communication (IEC) campaign to convey the benefits of RE will also increase awareness and 
social acceptance.
D. INVESTMENT AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES
With government’s aggressive promotion and adoption of cost-competitive sustainable RE 
technologies, the scale of investment into clean energy has been encouraging. As the country is 
abundant with these resources, investments in renewables propel a sustainable energy future. 
100 DO2013-12-0019 titled
“Strengthening the Management and Operations of the ARECs in the Philippines”Renewable Energy Service/Operating Contracts 
With a number of RESCs/REOCs being awarded annually for the development of RE technologies, 
greater employment opportunities have also been favorable to Filipinos. Additional green energy 
projects and jobs are expected to be deployed within the planning period as 277 RESCs under predevelopment stage were awarded as of end-2018 (Table 44). These contracts translated to an
equivalent potential capacity of 15,109.2 MW. 
Hydropower holds the greatest number of awarded RESCs with 119 providing an equivalent 
potential capacity of 6,798.9 MW followed by solar with 86 RESCs with potential capacity of 
6,464.7 MW. Awarded RESCs for wind totaled 39 with potential capacity of 1,239.70 MW, while 
geothermal has 25 RESCs with 585 MW, and ocean energy has 8 RESCs with 21 MW.
These projects under pre-development stage require a total investment of PhP 2,062.0 billion,
which could potentially create employment of 10,616. With most number of RESCs issued and 
requiring extensive pre-development works, hydropower gets the large chunks of the estimated 
investment cost for pre-development, more than 95.0 percent of total. Other renewable 
resources get less than 1.0 percent of total estimated investment. The falling costs of solar and 
wind make them economically competitive. Solar and wind farms have estimated investment of 
around PhP 5.5 billion. 
Competitive Renewable Energy Zones (CREZ)
Another prospective investments from RE are expected to come from the 25 candidate RE zones
(REZ) (Figure 63) with highest concentrations of high-quality wind and solar resources combined 
with demonstrated interest from project developers.
The CREZ is a stakeholder-driven planning process chaired by the DOE with financial support from 
the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and technical support from the 
U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory. This is in accordance with the DOE’s issued DC 2018-
09-0027, “Establishment and Development of CREZs in the Philippines.” This initiative aims to 
encourage the transmission upgrades and expansion towards the optimal utilization of the 
country’s indigenous RE resources.
The CREZ involves a proactive transmission planning approach, which aims to connect CREZ to the 
power system. Thus, these zones open the opportunities for private sector development and 
reduce investment barriers by directing transmission development and RE developers to the 
country’s most promising RE opportunities. 
101 In 2019, additional 144 RE projects with total potential capacity of 7,420.3 MW were awarded. Pre-development of these new RE projects could generate 
an additional investment of PhP 4595 billion while creating employment to 2470 Filipinos

demonstrated developer interest, thereby bringing down overall feasibility assessment costs.
The 25 selected CREZs across the Philippines have an estimated gross capacity of 152 GW of wind 
and solar photovoltaics (PVs) potentials. The zones also include an estimated 365 MW of 
geothermal, 375 MW of biomass, and over 650 GW of hydropower capacity distributed across the 
Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao systems (Table 45). The gross RE resources represent an upper 
bound assessment for each zone.

Initial results of the transmission expansion scenario models captured the integration of more than 
30 GW of wind and solar in CREZs by 2040. Renewable projects in CREZs with high capacity factors 
result in lower cost per megawatt-hour (PhP/MWh) and greater utlitilization of transmission 
assets.

Figure 63. 25 CANDIDATE CREZsPower sector development plays an invaluable role in fueling the economy and nation building. 
The country’s electric power industry is governed by Republic Act (RA) 9136 or the Electric Power 
Industry Reform Act (EPIRA) of 2001 that envisions a regime of a liberalized power industry 
towards fully achieving a competitive and a market-driven electricity sector. The EPIRA’s goals and 
objectives were further strengthened by RA 9513 or the Renewable Energy (RE) Act of 2008 that 
pushes the utilization of indigenous and new renewable energy resources to increase energy selfsufficiency and reduce dependence on imported fuels.
As the power sector continuously evolves along with technology innovation, the DOE remains 
committed with its mandate of formulating plans, programs, and policies to usher the sector’s 
unimpeded growth. This translates to a number of benefits such as ensuring economic stability, 
creation of wealth for communities and the people, and consumer empowerment, among others.
To heed the Administration’s call for inclusive growth and development, the DOE aligns its powerrelated development plans with the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2017-2022, the “Build, 
Build, Build, Infrastructure” Program and Ambisyon 2040, as a converging strategy to fast-track the 
attainment of the President’s priority thrusts and agenda.
In addition, the DOE crafted Power Sector Roadmap that encapsulates the generation, 
transmission, distribution and supply subsectors, including missionary and household 
electrification. The sub sector roadmaps outline the various strategies and approaches, which are 
targeted for implementation in the short- up to the long-term period. Each of the roadmaps are 
anchored on the power sector’s overall objectives by 2040, which are to: 1) ensure quality, reliable, 
affordable and secure supply; 2) expand access to electricity; 3) ensure a transparent and fair 
playing field in the power industry; and 4) accelerate total electricity access in the country.
Key legislations and their corresponding Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRRs) were likewise 
passed in 2019. These include RA No. 11234 or the Energy Virtual One Stop Shop Act, RA 11371 or 
the Murang Kuryente Act, and RA 11361 or the Anti-Obstruction of Power Lines Act. With these
laws in place, the benefits to be drawn by the electric power industry participants and stakeholders 
include accelerated implementation of power projects, continuous delivery of electricity service, 
and easing the burden on consumers.
 A. EXISTING POWER SYSTEM
The Philippines is an archipelago made up of 7,641 islands. With its geographical nature, the 
country’s electricity network is characterized by grid and off-grid power systems. The main grid is 
composed of three (3) sub-grids, namely, the Luzon and Visayas grids that are already 
interconnected via submarine cable, and the Mindanao grid that remains an independent grid
anticipating the completion of the Mindanao-Visayas Interconnection Project (MVIP). Once 
completed, the major grids can benefit from sharing of available capacities as a “One Grid 
Philippines.”
▪ Main Grid
In 2018, the main grid recorded a peak demand of 14,782 megawatts102 (MW). There were 235 
generating facilities with a total installed capacity of 23,281 MW103 and a dependable capacity of 
20,825 MW. Gross power generation in the same period stood at 98,308 gigawatt-hour104 (GWh). 
More than half of the electricity produced were sourced from coal-fired power plants, while a fifth 
came from natural gas. Renewable-based generation, such as geothermal, hydro, biomass and 
variable solar and wind power plants, contributed nearly one-fourth of total power generation. 
Oil-based power plant roughly supplied around 2.0 percent of electricity generated (Figure 64).
Electricity generated by the power plants is delivered at a higher voltage through the transmission 
system. The existing transmission assets, with total substation capacity of 34,852 MegavoltAmpere (MVA) and combined transmission line length of 20,505 circuit-kilometers (ckt-kms), are 
owned by the government through the National Transmission Corporation (TransCo). It is being 
operated and maintained by privately-owned company – National Grid Corporation of the 
Philippines (NGCP) – by virtue of RA 9511 or the NGCP Franchise Law105. Under the said franchise, 
the initial concession agreement between government and NGCP is for a duration of 25 years that 
can be renewed for another 25 years.
102 In 2019, the main grid recorded a peak demand of 15,581 MW.
103 In 2019, the main grid has a total installed capacity of 25,006 MW and total dependable capacity of 22,317 MW.
104 The 2019 gross power generation of the main grid reached 104,417 GWh.
105 Signed on 01 December 2008
Figure 64. EXISTING POWER SYSTEM (2018)
Source: DOE, NGCP and NPCThe distribution utilities (DUs) supply electricity to the end-users. As of 2018, the National 
Electrification Administration (NEA) supervises the operation of 100 Electric Cooperatives (ECs),
while the 24 Private Investor Owned Utilities (PIOUs) and Enerzones106 including the two (2) LGUOwned Utilities (LGUOUs) directly report to the DOE. During the period, total electricity sales or 
the amount of electricity consumed by the end-users of DUs in the main grid was 76,359 GWh107. 
The residential and commercial sectors are among the largest power users, which account for 36.2 
percent and 31.1 percent of total sales, respectively. Electricity consumption of the industrial sector 
closely followed with 30.5 percent, while the remaining 2.3 percent was accounted for the 
“others” sector for electricity used by public buildings and streetlights.
▪ Off-Grid
Off-grid power systems or “missionary areas” are those that are not yet connected to the main 
grid. These are typically small islands and isolated grids (SIIGs) whose electricity supply is being 
provided majority by the National Power Corporation (NPC), privately-owned New Power 
Providers (NPPs) for relatively large off-grid islands, and some Qualified Third Party (QTP) 
providers servicing far-flung and remote areas.
For the period in review, there are 181 power generation facilities in missionary areas. Of the total, 
139108 power plants are operated by the NPC-Small Power Utilities Group (NPC-SPUG), 32 from 
NPPs, six (6) are DU-owned, and four (4) from QTPs. Existing power plants have a total installed 
capacity of 534 MW and a dependable capacity of 416 MW109. In terms of power generation, total 
power produced reached 1,456 GWh110. About 97.1 percent was sourced from oil-based power 
plants, with only a small portion from RE-based generation facilities, particularly mini-hydro that 
contributed about 2.9 percent of the gross generation.
Aside from generating facilities, NPC-SPUG owns, manages and operates the transmission and 
substation assets of the government, with total substation capacity of 185 MVA and 776 ckt-kms 
of transmission lines. On the other hand, the NEA administers and supervises 21 Off-grid ECs, while 
the DOE directly oversees one (1) Multi-purpose Cooperative (MPC) and one LGUOU that act as 
local distribution utilities in SIIGs.
The 2018 electricity consumption of the off-grid was 1,163 GWh111, representing only 1.5 percent of
the total electricity consumption of the main grid. The residential sector accounted for the largest 
share demanding more than half of total. Meanwhile, the commercial, industrial and other sectors 
required 25.7 percent, 7.9 percent and 10.5 percent of the total electricity consumption, 
respectively.
B. GENERATION
The power generation sector’s roadmap articulates short- to long-term strategies anchored on the 
government’s overarching thrust and energy agenda of achieving power supply security, reliability, 
and sustainability throughout the country. It forms as an integral part of the holistic approach 
toward realizing the full restructuring and reform of the electric power industry in support of 
national development.
106 Enerzones are duly authorized entities operating within economic zones.
107 In 2019, the electricity sales of the main grid was 81,237 GWh, excluding directly connected customers (DCC).
108 Excluding the 135 small-scale power plants in the PRES mini-grids.
109 In 2019, off-grid power plants have a total installed capacity of 526 MW and a dependable capacity of 419 MW.
110 In 2019, gross power generation in off-grid areas reached 1,623 GWh.
111 In 2019
total electricity sales in off-grid areas reached 1278 GWhASSESSMENT
For the short-term period, the DOE has taken strategic strides to attain these key targets outlined 
in the roadmap. Relatedly, the electric power industry also welcomed milestone developments, 
new policy directions and crucial interventions that are instrumental in meeting the envisioned 
goals and outcomes of the sector.
1. Declaration of Major Power Projects as Energy Projects of National Significance
The promulgation of Executive Order No. 30 (EO30) creating the Energy Investment Coordinating 
Council (EICC) is a paramount development in the energy sector, particularly in securing a conducive 
business environment for energy investments. Through this executive issuance, the establishment 
of a simplified and streamlined regulatory process essentially can benefit the electric power 
industry investors in pursuing and expediting the implementation of proposed power 
infrastructure projects that are vital in ensuring the country’s energy security.
Two power generation projects have been granted with a Certificate of Energy Project of National 
Significance (CEPNS), namely: 
▪ The Atimonan One Energy 2 x 600 MW Coal-fired Power Project; and,
▪ The Energy World Corporation 650 MW Combined Cycle Gas Turbine Power Project with 
Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Import Terminal and Regasification Facility. 
▪ Addressing Issues Relative to Real Property Tax (RPT) and Local Taxes
In fulfillment of its mandate to provide a sustainable and reasonably-priced energy for the people,
the DOE continues to establish strategies to make electricity costs more competitive. Among the 
identified measures being considered by the DOE include the relaxation of government tariffs, 
such as exemption from real property and other local taxes being imposed by the LGUs to the 
power generation companies. 
In 2018, the DOE fully supported the Department of Finance (DOF) in proposing for an Executive 
Order mandating the reduction and condonation of real property taxes, interests and penalties for 
the period 2017. The proposed EO will cover the power generation facilities of the Independent 
Power Producers (IPPs) under the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) contracts with the Government 
Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs). It also intends to relieve the burden of the privatized 
IPPs that are yearly encountering problems on the assessment and payment of real property tax 
to the concerned LGUs. This initiative is in relation to the administration of IPP contracts, as part 
of the major functions of the Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management (PSALM) 
Corporation wherein the DOE sits as one of the agency’s Board of Directors.
▪ Granting of Business Permits and Licenses to Operate
The DOE evaluates, processes and issues necessary endorsements and certifications including 
permits and licenses to operate, which form part of the basic requirements of other government 
agencies relative to the construction of new power generating facilities. For the period in review, 
the DOE granted a total of 272 clearances in 2017 and endorsed 261 power projects in 2018 as 
presented in Table 46.Table 46. NUMBER OF CLEARANCES/ENDORSEMENTS ISSUED TO POWER GENERATION COMPANIES, 2017-2018

2. Establishment of Power Mix Policy for Power Generation towards Optimal Portfolio
The DOE remains cognizant of its crucial role in empowering the nation by ensuring the delivery of 
stable, secure, sufficient and accessible energy supply. In carrying out this mandate, the DOE firms 
up its strategies by instituting an appropriate power mix for electricity generation, which considers 
an optimal supply portfolio that meets the growing electricity demand including the reserve 
requirements of the grid. The optimal portfolio constitutes the required baseload, mid-merit and 
peaking power plant capacities based on least-cost options.
Parallel with this policy thrust, the DOE regularly formulates, on an annual basis, the power 
demand-supply outlook using a simulation software that provides optimal capacity addition 
planning. The Power Outlook 2018-2040 was presented in the E-Power Mo campaign held in Iloilo 
City last 09 October 2018.
3. Plant Performance Assessment and Audit/Benchmarking of Power Generation Facilities
On 03 May 2017, the DOE promulgated the Department Circular (DC) 2017-05-0008 titled “Providing 
for the Policies and Guidelines on the Conduct of Performance Assessment and Audit for All Power 
Generation, Transmission and Distribution Systems and Facilities.” The Circular provides the policy 
for the conduct of performance assessment and audit (PAA) of all facilities related to the power 
system – power generation, transmission, and distribution systems and facilities. In support of this 
issuance, DC 2017-12-0016 titled, “Adopting the Guidelines for the Performance Assessment and 
Audit of All Power Generation, Transmission and Distribution Systems and Facilities” was then 
issued on 28 December 2017, embodying the implementing guidelines of all PAA activities of the 
DOE.
These Circulars are enforced to serve as effective guideposts to evaluate the overall performance 
and efficiency of power facilities with respect to their mandated operational standards. In 
addition, these policies are also aimed at identifying existing gaps and challenges in the policies 
and regulations in the electric power industry, as well as the necessary action plans that are 
instrumental for the review and development of corrective policy measures.
In the last quarter of 2018, the DOE’s Performance Assessment and Audit Team on Power 
Generation Facilities (PAAT-PGF) spearheaded the conduct of PAA in the following grid-connected 
power generation facilities listed in Table 47.Likewise, the DOE is firming up the engagement of professional consultants to strengthen the 
sustainability, institutional capacity and the overall improvement of the program. In line with this, 
the DOE completed the procurement process for the Consultancy Services that is responsible for 
enhancing the PAA implementing guidelines, including the accreditation of the third-party
independent auditors.
4. Periodic Monitoring of Power Generation Projects
As part of its regular function, the DOE closely monitors the development phase of power 
generation projects that are in the pipeline to ensure that these capacity additions are timely 
commissioned based on their scheduled commercial operations.
In 2018, new generating capacities with an aggregate capacity of 934 MW were commissioned 
during the period as enumerated in Table 48. Of the total, nearly 80.0 percent was coal, 13.0 
percent from renewables and less than 10.0 percent oil-based plants. New capacities from 
renewables comprised of 80 MW hydropower, 34 MW biomass and 12 MW geothermal. About 
70.0 percent of these newly installed capacities are located in Luzon, and the remaining in 
Mindanao. Meanwhile, Visayas maintained a stable power supply despite no additional capacities 
that came online in the region.

PLANS AND PROGRAMS
Mindful of its crucial role in 
powering the nation, the DOE is 
poised to buckle up concrete 
strategies under the generation 
roadmap for greater power supply 
security, grid stability, and increase 
sustainability in the long-run. In 
pursuit of this goal, the DOE 
continues to bring forth suitable 
policy regulations coupled with 
pragmatic mechanisms to 
promote full competition and 
increase transparency in the 
power sector (Figure 65).
1. Formulation and Updating of Power Demand and Supply Outlook as Reference for Investments
To upkeep the DOE’s societal contributions toward national development, the formulation and 
periodic updating of the country’s power demand and supply outlook remains as a priority 
program. In carrying out this mandate, the DOE stays vigilant in developing its electricity 
projections giving due consideration on optimal power mix, technology neutral approach, and fuel 
diversity.
The power outlook serves as a firm reference for enticing more investments in the electric power 
industry, and as a responsive measure to meet the dynamic needs of surging economy. The 
positioning of landmark policies and regulations aimed at revamping the rigid business processes 
and transaction-making in the government are seen to revitalize the private sector’s investment 
interest with a big appetite for the energy sector. These remarkably flag a turning point to attract 
more investors and infuse the much-needed capital, particularly in the power generation business.
Figure 65. POWER GENERATION ROADMAP2. Monitor Implementation of Power Generation Projects
To support the power outlook, the DOE constantly monitors the committed and indicative power 
projects to facilitate their timely completion to fill up the requirement of the grid. As of 31 
December 2018, a total of 45 committed power projects with corresponding aggregate installed 
capacity112 of 6,329 MW were listed in the private sector initiated power projects of the DOE. On a 
per grid basis, Luzon requires three-fourths of the committed, while Visayas and Mindanao share 
the remaining as shown in Figure 66 and Table 49.
Among fuel sources, capacity from conventional power plant type (coal, oil-based and natural gas) 
totals 5,813 MW, constituting more than 90.0 percent of the committed capacity. Meanwhile, 
renewables (geothermal, hydro, solar, wind, and biomass) make up a little less than 10.0 percent 
of the total capacity, or 516 MW.

By fuel type, renewable-based generation facilities sum up at 18,161 MW, accounting for 54.9
percent of the total indicative capacity, mostly from solar (Table 50). On the other hand, fossilbased fuels, composed of coal, natural gas and oil represent 31.6 percent, 12.3 percent, and 1.3 
percent shares, respectively. Meanwhile, the 14 projects using battery energy storage system 
(BESS) are also included in the indicative projects with an aggregate capacity of 500 MW. The 
detailed list of the committed and indicative power projects as of 31 December 2018 can be found in 
Annexes 19-24.
3. Endorsements of Power-related Projects
Considering the positive economic outlook of the country, the DOE deems it vital to have adequate 
and sufficient capacity additions across the grids. To realize this, the DOE strictly reviews, 
evaluates and endorses power-related projects with due diligence consistent with existing policies 
and regulatory framework. In conjunction, the DOE continually processes and issues pertinent 
clearances and endorsements, and oversees project implementation to ensure the timely 
completion and commercial operations of the power generation projects.
Figure 67. INDICATIVE POWER PROJECTS (As of 31 December 2018)4. Crafting of Policies on the Entry of New Emerging Technologies for Power Generation
The policy direction of the DOE on fuel source diversity aims to address the reliance of the power 
sector to a particular fuel source toward electricity supply security. In parallel with this thrust, the 
DOE is set to pursue the formulation of enabling policies to push for the strategic pacing and 
mainstreaming of advanced and emerging technologies for power generation, such as ocean 
thermal energy conversion (OTEC), fuel cells, nuclear energy, and energy storage system (ESS), 
among others.
To initiate the development of the policy framework on the adoption of ESS in the country, the 
DOE steered several Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and consultations nationwide among energy 
agencies, electric power industry participants, and stakeholders. Inputs from the said FGDs and 
Public Consultations form part of the DC 2019-08-0012 titled “Providing a Framework for Energy 
Storage System in the Electric Power Industry”, which was signed on 01 August 2019. The 
implementation of the Circular is timely for the medium- to long-term targets of the roadmap.
Another technology that the DOE monitors is the development of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) in 
the power sector. In 2017, the DOE issued a policy for the Philippine Downstream Natural Gas 
Regulation (PDNGR), which aims to expedite the entry of LNG to the country in time for the 
depletion of the Malampaya Natural Gas reservoir. 
Meanwhile, initiatives for the development of administrative policies on other emerging 
technologies for power generation are already underway and remain as continuing targets of the 
roadmap within the planning period.
5. Development of Resiliency Policies for Power Generating Facilities
Ensuing the promulgation of the universal framework for Energy Resiliency Policy, the DOE also 
focuses on developing the governing policies to reinforce the resiliency of power generation 
facilities. The policy broadly grasps operational protocols and contingency measures to make 
power facilities withstand all forms of natural and human-induced calamities and immediately 
restore the electricity service.
The said policy is primarily aimed at mitigating and adapting to adverse impacts of climate change 
and strengthen safety and dependability of the power system of the country. It is seen as an 
imperative strategy for continuous delivery of power services amidst uncontrollable disruptive 
events.
6. Monitoring and Assessment of Power Demand and Supply Situation
In the performance of its regular function, the DOE constantly monitors and assesses power 
demand and supply situation, which is imperative for conveying timely, strategic, and proactive 
measures for the sector. Learning from previous experiences, the DOE ardently executes full 
authority over mandated industry participants to ensure quality, reliability, affordability and 
security of supply of electric power across the country.
7. Monitoring of Compliance to Reportorial Requirements
The DOE upholds its supervisory role to all electric power industry participants, including energy 
stakeholders, by monitoring their compliance to reportorial requirements set forth by existing laws policies and regulations of the government. These reports serve as decisive platform and effective 
tool to strengthen and improve the DOE’s planning and policy making functions.
C. TRANSMISSION 
The Transmission Development Roadmap is a clear and comprehensive pathway that directly 
supports the national goal of achieving reliability and integrity of the country’s transmission grid. 
This roadmap assessment highlights the implementation of the commitments set out in the shortterm (2017-2018) linked to realizing the target goals for medium- to long-term.
ASSESSMENT
1. Timely Completion of Transmission Projects 
With the growing load and steadily increasing demand, the timely completion and commissioning 
of transmission infrastructures remain high in the DOE’s agenda. Such is in pursuit of decongesting 
the existing transmission facilities and enabling the connection of new power projects to the grid
allowing greater market competition.
For the short-term assessment, the NGCP focused on upgrading substation capacities and 
expanding transmission backbones to support entry of new generating facilities. From 2017 to 
2018, the NGCP completed a total of 552.24 ckt-km of overhead transmission lines, installed 
additional 851 MVA of substation capacities, and added 35 megavolt amperes reactive (MVAR) or 
reactive power for voltage improvement (Table 51).
To ensure timely completion of the planned projects, the DOE endorsed a total of 48 transmission 
projects of the NGCP as “Energy Projects of National Significance.” To date, all these projects have 
already been issued with CEPNS by the DOE, and thus, entitled to all the rights and privileges under 
EO30. (Please see Annex 25 for the List of Projects with CEPNS). With priority status, expeditious 
implementation and development of transmission projects is highly expected.

Source: NGCPIn addition, the DOE also endorsed to the NCIP for the issuance of a Certification 
Precondition/Certificate of Non-Overlap (CP/CNO) of the following major transmission projects:
▪ Mindanao-Visayas Interconnection Project or MVIP;
▪ Nabas-Caticlan-Boracay Transmission Project;
▪ Cebu-Negros-Panay 230 KV Backbone Project (Stage 3); and,
▪ Tiwi Substation Upgrading Project.
2. Power Plants Siting
As part of continuous enhancement in the formulation of Transmission Development Plan (TDP), 
the NGCP has included in the Plan the ideal locations of power plants to maximize the capability of 
the existing network and to serve as a guide for investors in power generation (Figures 68, 69 and 
70). The recommended connection points are the areas with existing substations that can still 
accommodate additional connection of new power plants without the need for any transmission 
reinforcement. Future siting of power plants reduces the need for major transmission 
reinforcement to address congestion, as well as to cater bulk generation capacity addition. 
Figure 68. IDEAL LOCATION OF POWER PLANTS, LuzonFigure 69. IDEAL LOCATION OF POWER PLANTS, Visayas
Figure 70. IDEAL LOCATION OF POWER PLANTS, Mindanao3. Expedite Interconnection of Major Grids 
For the short-term, the DOE is committed to facilitate the interconnection of the three major grids 
(Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao) to ultimately achieve the longstanding goal of a unified national 
grid. Hence, the project with the highest priority among other interconnection projects is the 
MVIP.
Considered as one of the biggest power infrastructure projects, the implementation of the MVIP 
is in the close watch of the DOE. In July 2017, the NGCP was granted by the ERC the provisional 
authority to implement the project. In May 2018, the project qualified as an EPNS and was issued 
with CEPNS. With this, the issuance of regulatory and documentary requirements by the different 
local and national government agencies will be expedited to meet the target completion date of 
December 2021. 
4. Monitoring of Compliance with Transmission Development Plan
As part of its continuing activities, the DOE is closely monitoring the implementation of projects 
identified in the TDP 2016-2040. The projects mainly consist of continuous upgrading, 
rehabilitation, and expansion of existing transmission lines, substations and other related facilities. 
Currently, one of the monitoring mechanisms is through the NGCP’s submission of monthly status 
report of transmission projects that indicates the progress of various project items including 
securing permits and clearances. 
5. Resiliency Planning 
With the introduction of the Resiliency Policy by the DOE, one of the key highlights of TDP is the 
planning considerations for resiliency to improve the ability of the power system to withstand the 
effects of adverse environmental conditions, man-made power interruptions, and other system 
disturbances. To make the transmission system resilient, the NGCP included in its resiliency 
planning the enhancement of transmission line and substation site selection, increase of 
transmission towers strength and capacity, and security of transmission assets. 
PLANS AND PROGRAMS
To fulfill the vision of a strong, 
unified electricity transmission 
network that can meet the 
country’s increasing power needs 
until 2040, the DOE warrants the 
formulation of a responsive TDP
through the NGCP, giving due 
importance on continuous 
transmission system upgrades 
and expansion, generation siting 
with no reinforcement 
requirement, island 
interconnections, and building 
necessary transmission 
infrastructures to enable the 
connection of renewable energy 
plants.
 Figure 71. POWER TRANSMISSION ROADMAPResponding to the need to 
upgrade and expand the existing 
transmission system, the DOE 
continues its initiative to monitor 
and facilitate the timely 
completion of transmission 
projects with reference to the 
TDP 2019-2040, a 22-year 
roadmap for the expansion of the 
Philippine power grid. As shown 
in Table 52 and Figure 72, part of 
the priority projects is the 
development of new 
transmission backbones and 
island interconnections that are 
geared towards the DOE’s and 
the NGCP’s vision to build the 
strongest power grid in 
Southeast Asia and improving the 
country’s transmission network 
consistent with the long-term 
Transmission Master Plan (TMP).

Since some of the segments of these huge and complicated backbone projects included in the TMP 
are still subject for detailed studies, the DOE focuses more attention to the following significant 
projects programmed for completion up to 2025 and considered crucial in the development of the 
grid:
Figure 72. TRANSMISSION BACKBONES AND ISLAND INTERCONNECTIONS1. Metro Manila 500 kV Backbone Loop
The only Extra High Voltage 
(EHV) drawdown facilities 
servicing Metro Manila are the 
two existing 500 kV 
substations located in San Jose 
del Monte City, Bulacan and 
Dasmariñas, Cavite. These 
become critical nodes in the 
grid as capacity expansion and 
space limitations in these 
substations could result in grid 
congestion. For a more 
efficient power network, part 
of the proposed long-term 
expansion plan for Metro 
Manila is the development of 
the new 500 kV substations, 
such as the Taguig EHV 
Substation. Taguig City is 
considered as the priority site due to its proximity to the load center. The development of Taguig 
EHV Substation including its associated 500 kV Lines will support the load growth and strengthen 
the grid by forming loop configurations. Aside from Taguig EHV Substation, major 500/230 kV 
drawdown substations will be developed around the area – the Marilao 500 kV Substation and 
Silang 500 kV Substation including its associated 500 kV lines (Figure 73). 
2. Bolo to Laoag 500 kV Backbone
The development of Bolo to 
Laoag 500 kV Transmission Line 
addresses the entry of the 
proposed coal, hydro, and wind 
power generating plants in the 
north eastern part of the grid 
(Figure 74). The backbone 
development is consisted of two 
projects: (1) Bolo–Balaoan 500 
kV Transmission Line to support 
the entry of large generation 
capacity, such as the 4x335 MW 
Luna Coal Plant in La Union, and 
the 500 MW Pumped- Storage 
Hydro Power Plant in Benguet; 
and, (2) Balaoan–Laoag 500 kV 
Transmission Line to 
accommodate the additional 
wind farm project in Ilocos area 
and address the overloading of 
the San Esteban–Laoag 230 kV 
Line during N-1 contingency.
Figure 73. METRO MANILA TRANSMISSION OUTLOOK
Figure 74. BOLO TO LAOAG 500 KV BACKBONE3. Batangas-Mindoro Interconnection Project (BMIP)
The project intends to develop a 
230 kV interconnection via 
submarine cable between the 
island of Mindoro and main 
Luzon grid. This allows the 
island to have access on bulk 
generation sources in the main 
grid, while at the same time, 
export possible excess power 
once the generation potentials 
within the island have been 
developed. Based on the 
conducted transmission line 
route investigation, the nearest 
connection substation is the 
proposed Pinamukan 500 kV 
Substation in Batangas. The 
expected improvement in 
supply reliability can result in 
better economic growth as the 
island could attract more 
investors for industrial and 
commercial loads, and for the 
tourism industry (Figure 75).
4. Palawan-Mindoro Interconnection Project (PMIP)
The envisioned Batangas-Mindoro 
Interconnection Project gives rise 
to the proposed interconnection 
of Palawan to the Luzon Grid 
through the Mindoro Grid. The 
Palawan Mindoro Interconnection 
Project (PMIP) aims to provide the 
Mainland Palawan a more reliable 
supply of power and to address 
the power quality issues, which 
result in frequent blackouts 
experienced by the customers. 
The project development will be 
implemented in a stage-by-stage 
basis. Stage 1 covers the conduct 
of detailed studies to determine 
the submarine cable route, as well 
as the preparation of the Mindoro 
Backbone through the 
development of Calapan–San Jose 
230 kV Transmission Line 
Figure 75. CONNECTION CONFIGURATION OF BMIP
Figure 76. CONNECTION CONFIGURATION OF PMIPBackbone and San Jose 230 kV Substation in Occidental Mindoro. The Stage 2 involves the physical 
implementation of the PMIP (Figure 76).
5. Western Luzon 500 kV Backbone
The first stage of this grid 
expansion project is the 
construction of CastillejosHermosa 500 kV Transmission Line 
to accommodate the bulk 
generation in Zambales, such as 
the 2X300 MW RP Energy CoalFired Power Plant. The new line 
will be initially energized at 230 kV 
voltage level and will form part of 
the proposed long-term plan for 
500 kV backbone loop 
development from Bolo 
(Kadampat) down to Hermosa 
Substation. The second stage will 
complete the reinforcement of the 
capacity of the western corridor 
presently consisting of a singlecircuit line from Labrador down to Botolan to Hanjin then to Olongapo, which involves the 
construction of a new Castillejos Substation, Bolo Substation, and the Castillejos-Bolo 500kV 
Transmission Line, creating the Bolo–Castillejos–Hermosa 500 kV Transmission Line backbone in 
Western Luzon (Figure 77). The long-term development plan considers providing higher level of 
reliability up to N-2 contingency for the 500 kV backbone system of the Luzon grid.
6. Cebu-Negros-Panay 230 kV Backbone
The development of 230 kV transmission 
backbone from Cebu up to Panay Island is 
divided into three stages. The development 
of high capacity transmission corridor via 
submarine cable between Negros and 
Panay forms part of the first stage of the 
project. The submarine cable component 
was already energized in October 2016 
addressing the congestion and market 
issues brought about by the limited capacity 
of the existing single-circuit 138 kV link
(Figure 78). 
The second stage involves the construction 
of 230 kV facilities in the existing Cebu 138 
kV Substation. It aims to facilitate the 
termination of the proposed overhead 
transmission line from the 300 MW coalfired power plant of Therma Visayas, Inc. in 
Toledo City, Cebu. 
Figure 78. CEBU-NEGROS-PANAY 230 KV BACKBONE
Figure 77. WESTERN LUZON 500 KV BACKBONETo enable the sharing of power supply among the three islands, the last stage includes the 
development of 230 kV facilities extending from Barotac Viejo Substation in Panay to a new 
Magdugo Substation in Cebu. It is intended to accommodate the transmission of excess power 
from Panay and Negros Islands towards the rest of the Visayas grid and possibly, the Luzon grid. 
7. Mindanao 230 kV 
Transmission Backbone
This backbone project aims to 
further strengthen the entire 
Mindanao grid upon the entry of 
new generating plants. It entails 
two major activities – the 
construction of the 230 kV 
Transmission Line traversing 
Matanao-Toril-Bunawan route, 
and the energization of the 
existing Mindanao Transmission 
Backbone (Balo-i-VillanuevaMaramag-Bunawan) to 230 kV 
voltage level. Energizing the 
Mindanao Backbone to 230 kV 
voltage level allows full dispatch 
of the new large power plants 
and eliminate the vulnerability 
of power supply to hydropower (Figure 79).
8. Mindanao-Visayas Interconnection Project 
(MVIP)
Formerly known as the Visayas-Mindanao 
Interconnection Project, the change to MVIP 
aims to highlight the importance and priority 
given to Mindanao grid, which has long been 
isolated. The project aims to realize a single, 
unified national grid by connecting the 
Mindanao grid to the Visayas grid. Based on 
the desktop study and results of the 
hydrographic survey, the recommended 
route traverses the country’s western 
seaboard through the Zamboanga del NorteCebu interconnection (Figure 80). 
The project’s potential benefits is on reduced 
investments in power generation due to 
sharing of system reserves, lesser investment 
in power generation in either the Visayas or 
Mindanao to maintain the one-day Loss of 
Load Probability (LOLP), and reduction of 
operating cost due to economic dispatch of 
Figure 79. MINDANAO 230 KV TRANSMISSION BACKBONE
Figure 80. CONNECTION CONFIGURATION OF MVIPgenerators. Further, it will help optimize the use of available energy resources and additional 
generation capacities in the country in support to the operation of the electricity market to include 
the Mindanao grid. 
9. Eastern Mindanao 230 kV Transmission Line
The project entails reinforcement of the 
existing 138 kV single circuit transmission 
line serving the substations of Butuan, 
San Francisco, Bislig and Nabunturan in 
eastern Mindanao, which already lacks 
the single outage contingency 
requirement as prescribed in the 
Philippine Grid Code (PGC). This 
development addresses the anticipated 
power quality problems caused by 
possible operations of huge mining loads 
in the area. More so, it serves as an initial 
step in establishing a higher transmission 
corridor in the north eastern Mindanao 
area. The implementation of the project 
requires a total of 282.68 km of new 230 
kV transmission lines, required power 
circuit breaker (PCBs) and associated 
equipment (Figure 81).
The list of transmission projects identified in the TDP is summarized in Annexes 26-27, detailing all 
ongoing and future projects including the expected completion dates.
From a number of transmission projects that are part of the TDP, the DOE embarks to keep a tight 
watch on the implementation of MVIP to fully realize the vision of one Philippine grid in 2020. 
Similarly, the interconnection of emergent island-grids to the main grid are also envisioned to be 
implemented by building new interconnection facilities that link the isolated islands to the main 
grids (Annex 28).
The DOE is also set to monitor and assess forced outages and significant incidences of transmission 
facilities to avoid major system disturbances causing power interruptions and transmission-related 
outages. To efficiently address the damage brought by natural and man-made disasters to 
transmission lines and facilities, the grid operator and the DOE will continue to disaster-proof the 
country’s transmission network for long-term resilience through developing climate-resilient 
transmission infrastructures and implementing resiliency policies and programs specific for 
transmission subsector. 
The DOE deems it necessary to continuously enhance the transmission policies to achieve the 
targets specified for medium- to long-term and carry out the implementation schemes in the TDP. 
D. DISTRIBUTION
The DOE provides continuous support to the DUs in increasing their capacities and improving the 
quality of service provided to their franchise areas through new policies and programs. These 
include the issuance of a policy on the conduct of PAA on the distribution system and facilities and 
Figure 81. EASTERN MINDANAO 230 KV TRANSMISSIONthe drafting of DCs directing amendments and additional guidelines on the Distribution 
Development Plan (DDP). 
Policy on the conduct of Competitive Selection Process (CSP), framework for the uniform monthly 
electric bill format, and the rules governing the review and evaluation of direct connection 
applications were also issued in accordance with the DOE’s mandate in ensuring transparent and 
a reasonable price of electricity. 
ASSESSMENT
1. Distribution Development Plan
To effectively implement the DC 2004-02-002 titled “Prescribing the Guidelines for the Formulation 
of a Five-Year Distribution Development Plan” pursuant to Section 2 of DC 2003-12-011, “Enjoining all 
Distribution Utilities to Supply Adequate, Affordable, Quality and Reliable Electricity,” the DOE 
drafted a DC directing amendments and providing additional guidelines to DC 2004-02-002. 
The draft guidelines will require DU’s additional information on the existing and potential 
contestable customers for Retail Competition and Open Access (RCOA), available renewable 
resources and the number of customers with net-metering in preparation for the Renewable 
Portfolio Standards (RPS) and the Green Energy Option Program (GEOP). Information on the 
capital expenditure projects and financing requirements should also be reflected in their 
respective five-year DDPs. Through these provisions, the DOE will be able to closely monitor, in 
close coordination with ERC, the operability of all distribution facilities and the progress in project 
implementation.
In 2018, the DOE completed the DDP 2017-2026, which outlines the 10-year demand outlook and 
supply requirements of the DUs and their contracted supply mix. The plan highlights the growth 
rate of peak demand annually over the 10-year planning period, as well as the main drivers of 
projected load growth. It also presents a comparative analysis of the estimated values for 2016 on 
the number of customers, energy sales and system loss from the previous DDP 2016-2025 vis-a-vis 
the actual 2016 data as indicated in the DDP 2017-2026.
2. Uniform Monthly Electric Bill Framework
To protect public interest affected by rates and services of the DUs and electricity supply providers, 
the DOE promulgated the Framework for the Uniform Monthly Electric Bill Format through DC
2018-08-0026 issued on 14 September 2018. The framework provides that all entities issuing 
electricity bills –PIOUs, ECs, LGOUs and other entities authorized by law to distribute and/or supply 
electricity, including the Retail Electricity Suppliers – shall use a uniform bill format. The uniform bill 
should reflect all corresponding charges, such as, but not limited to generation, transmission and 
ancillary services, distribution, supply and metering charges, universal charges and bill deposits, 
subject to the rules and regulations that the ERC may promulgate. In June 2018, four public 
consultations on the draft DC were conducted in Mandaluyong City, General Santos City, Cebu City 
and Puerto Princesa City, Palawan. 
Efforts to continuously empower electricity consumers with greater understanding on monthly 
electricity bill, the DOE has prepared regular statistics on electricity charges on generation rates, 
transmission rates, unbundled distribution costs and the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market 
(WESM) prices, which can be accessed via the DOE website (www.doe.gov.ph).3. Competitive Selection Process Policy
With the government’s thrust of ensuring that all the DUs must supply an adequate power and 
reserves to serve its respective captive market in the least cost manner, the CSP Policy through DC
2018-02-0003 titled “Adopting and Prescribing for the Competitive Selection Process in the 
Procurement by the Distribution Utilities of Power Supply Agreement for the Captive Market” was 
issued on 01 February 2018. The policy prescribes the conduct of CSP as a clear, transparent and 
fair supply procurement process that will promote competition and greater private sector 
participation in the provision of least-cost, reliable and adequate supply of electricity. It addresses 
the power supply contracting of the electric power utilities serving both on-grid and off-grid areas 
in the country.
In compliance with its provisions, the DUs are required to establish a Third-Party Bids and Awards 
Committee (TPBAC) or Joint TPBAC or may opt to engage a Third-Party Auctioneer in lieu of the 
TPBAC or Joint TPBAC. Further, the selection process of the TPBAC or Joint TPBAC captive 
customer representatives must be submitted to the DOE for approval. As of December 2018, the 
DOE approved the selection process for 16 DUs. 
During the initial implementation of the policy, 16 DUs (15 DUs and 1 PIOU) were granted a 
Certificate of Exemption as of December 2018 as listed in Table 53.

To implement the PAA for the 
distribution system, the 
Performance Assessment and 
Audit Team on Distribution 
System Facilities (PAAT-DSF) 
has been created under DC 2017-
05-0008. The PAAT-DSF is 
chaired by the DOE and 
composed of NEA, Distribution 
Management Committee, TransCo, and Philippine Electricity Market Corporation (PEMC). The list 
of 2018 PAA conducted activities for distribution system is shown in Table 54.
Findings and recommendations from PAA activities were presented on 21 May 2019 during a 
workshop organized by the DOE in coordination with the NPC and NEA. The workshop was 
intended to have a common understanding of the situation, and to ensure implementation of the 
recommended policies, programs and strategies through an action Plan.
5. Direct Connection Applications of Industrial, Commercial and Other Electricity End-Users
Pursuant to Section 9 of the EPIRA, which states that TransCo or its Buyer/Concessionaire shall 
provide open and non-discriminatory access to its transmission system to all electricity users, the 
DOE issued DC 2018-08-0025 on 24 August 2018 “Prescribing the Rules Governing the Review and 
Evaluation of Direct Connection Applications of Industrial, Commercial and Other Electricity EndUsers.” The Circular allows transparent guidelines on the assessment of applications for direct 
connections to the grid or sub-transmission assets that are still owned by TransCo. Applications 
were previously being reviewed by the ERC until the Supreme Court ruled that the distribution of 
energy resource, specifically direct supply of electricity is not within the authority of the ERC but 
falls within the DOE’s jurisdiction. In May 2014, the ERC endorsed to the DOE all direct connection 
applications.
The DC also provides the creation of the Direct Connection Review and Evaluation Committee 
(DREC) with primary mandate to evaluate all applications and recommend for the approval of the 
DOE Secretary. As of October 2018, 15 applications were reviewed and evaluated by the DREC, of 
which, two applications were approved, namely Summit Iron and Pueblo de Panay Technopark 
(Table 55).

short-term remain as continuing 
agenda for the DOE in the mediumto long-term period. Realization of 
infrastructure projects is a priority 
undertaking of the government 
coupled with effective policy 
framework and reinforced 
strategies and programs. These 
efforts are expected to improve 
the operations and quality of 
services provided to the electricity 
end-users.
1. Enhancement of Distribution Utility’s Development Planning
A draft circular directing amendment and providing additional guidelines to DC 2004-02-002, titled 
“Prescribing the Guidelines for the Formulation of a Five-Year Distribution Development Plan,” is 
expected to be adopted and promulgated within the medium-term. The corresponding manual of 
instructions will be drafted and disseminated to properly guide the DUs in filling out the new DDP 
form (DOE-EPIMB Form 2018-01-01), which is composed of four major sections, namely; (1) 
Introduction and Legal Basis; (2) Objective; (3) Forms and Annexes; and (4) Summary Outputs.
In accordance with the timeline set forth in the EPIRA, the DOE-EPIMB Form 2018-01-01 shall be
submitted every 25th of January each year. A series of workshops will also be conducted to ensure 
that the DUs conform with prescribed new guidelines.
2. Monitoring of Timely Implementation of necessary Distribution Facilities Projects
To ensure reliability, security and sustainable delivery of electricity to the consuming public, the 
DOE will facilitate the timely completion of the following infrastructure projects as indicated in the 
DDP 2017-2026:
▪ 19,934 MVA additional substation capacity;
▪ 5,156 ckt-km for the expansion and rehabilitation of sub-transmission lines;
▪ 39,944 ckt-km for the expansion and rehabilitation of distribution lines.
Distribution line upgrades and expansion programs also form part of the medium- to long-term 
strategies to safeguard the power distribution network across the country. Interceding barriers, 
such as right-of-way issues, that hinder sustainable development will also be properly addressed.
3. Monitoring of DUs’ Compliance to Reportorial Requirements
Improving data quality and developing more robust in-country monitoring and reportorial of the 
distribution systems will also be a major concern of the DOE within the planning period to ensure 
progress in the implementation of projects by the DUs. An appropriate template/matrix will be 
promulgated to guarantee reportorial compliance and performance indicator of the DUs.
Figure 82. POWER DISTRIBUTION
ROADMAPAs provided under DC 2017-12-0016 (guidelines for performance assessment and audit or PAA), the 
DUs need to submit the compliance audit form to effectively implement the PAA of distribution 
system. This enables the thorough inspection and evaluation of the operations and facilities, and 
adheres to the principle of efficiency, effectiveness, appropriateness and safety of the distribution 
network.
4. Implementation of Policies toward Operational Efficiency and Good Governance of the DUs
The DOE continues to espouse policies to improve the operational efficiency of the distribution 
system in the country. Creating better working conditions further improve performance, and thus 
achieve developmental objectives, including enhancing cooperation within the distribution 
network.
5. Strengthening Institutional Cooperation to ensure Transparent and Effective Competitive 
Selection Process 
The DOE institutionalizes collaboration among participating entities under the CSP policy to 
effectively implement the governing principles stipulated in the Circular. Allowing equal 
opportunity and wide dissemination of bid opportunities to eligible and qualified generation 
companies encourage greater participation. This will also gather wide range and broad-based 
support and cooperation among energy stakeholders. 
6. Ensure Equitable Access to Electricity Services
Enabling access to basic electricity services brings significant economic benefits to communities. 
This redounds to increased business activities, economic productivity and income. Mindful of this, 
the DOE continues to look for strategic solutions and pragmatic approaches to achieve sustainable 
development towards the delivery of an affordable and reliable electricity services across the 
country.
E. RETAIL ELECTRICITY SUPPLY
The DOE is keen on the full implementation of RCOA to allow electricity end-users to buy electricity 
from the suppliers of their choice. Being the conduit between the suppliers and end-users of 
electricity, the DUs recovers their investments through the imposition of distribution wheeling 
charges. The move toward RCOA is pursuant to Section 31 of the EPIRA. RCOA took effect when 
the ERC declared compliance to the conditions set forth in the EPIRA, which are: a) establishment 
of the WESM; b) approval of unbundled transmission and distribution wheeling charges; c) initial 
implementation of cross subsidy removal scheme; d) privatization of at least 70.0 percent of the 
generating assets of the NPC in Luzon and Visayas; and, e) transfer of the management and control 
of at least 70.0 percent of the total energy output of power plants under contract with the NPC to 
the Independent Power Producer Administrators (IPPA).
In continuing pursuit of the objectives of the EPIRA, the Supply Sector Roadmap for the short-term 
(2017 – 2018) resulted in promulgation of policies that facilitated the following: a) mandatory 
contestability for one Megawatt (MW) and up electricity end-users; b) full open access for 750 
kilowatt (kW) and above contestable customers; c) retail aggregation for a minimum of 750 kW 
aggregated demand; and d) conduct market studies for lowering contestability to 500 kW.ASSESSMENT
1. Retail Competition and Open Access 
With the electricity industry having complied with the conditions as stipulated in the EPIRA, RCOA 
was introduced on 26 June 2013 and allowed electricity end-users of 1.0 MW and above to choose 
their electricity suppliers. The end-users categorized as contestable customers are permitted to 
source their supply from retail electricity suppliers (RES) and the use of transmission and 
distribution systems and associated facilities subject to the payment of distribution wheeling 
charges duly approved by the ERC. The implementation of RCOA presented a voluntary 
participation from contestable customers. It was only in December 2016 that the mandatory 
participation of the contestable customers with an average demand of 1.0 MW and above was 
directed. 
A Supreme Court restraining order on RCOA prompted the DOE to revert to voluntary 
participation. To advance RCOA’s implementation, the threshold was reduced to 500 kW in 
December 2018. The implementation of retail aggregation114 was intended to commence last 
December 2018 subject to the issuance of relevant guidelines.
The DCs promulgated by the DOE for RCOA’s transparent and efficient implementation are 
highlighted in Table 56.

114 Allows customers in a contiguous area whose aggregate demand is not less than 500 kW to source their electricity supply requirement on a group basis 
from a licensed supplier.
115 On 29 July 2019, the DOE issued Department Circular No. 2019-07-0011, entitled Amending Various Issuances on the Implementation of the Retail 
Competition and Open Access” in order to address gaps and ensure the implementation of RCOAAs of April 2019, the total prospective participants for RCOA already reached 2,033, an increase of 
112.0 percent from 961 participants during RCOA’s initial commercial operation (Table 57). 
Contestable customers comprised 93.0 percent (1,884) of the prospective participants, 3.0 percent 
(55) from suppliers (including local retail electricity suppliers116), and the remaining 4.0 percent (94) 
from RCOA service providers. 
For the same period, the total RCOA participants registered with the Central Registration Body 
(CRB) stood at 1,356117. From the registered contestable customers, 81.0 percent (999 customers) 
is within the 1.0 MW threshold, and the rest (19.0 percent or 241 customers) is within the 750 kW –
1 MW.
Policy and regulatory issuances relating to RCOA were also promulgated in 2018 and these are ERC 
Resolution No. 9 Series of 2018118 and the DOE DC 2018-04-0010119. The former specifies that the 
customer may choose its payment option whether single or multiple billing scheme. It also 
provides that the contestable customers have the option to contract on its own directly to the RES
and/or the WESM for their supply and to the network service provider for metering services. In 
such setup, customers are billed separately for the services. Meanwhile, the latter clarifies the 
application and treatment of retail market participants under the WESM rules and specifies the 
application of standards under the DUs to the contestable customers.
RCOA is one of the policies that will impact consumers or end-users. The policy empowers 
consumers because they can opt for their preferred electricity supplier, provided they belong to 
the right threshold of contestable customers. Having the freedom of preference for electricity 
supply has a bearing on electricity cost reduction and expands transparency in the electricity 
industry.
PLANS AND PROGRAMS
As a continuing action plan that spans from the medium- to long-term, the supply subsector will 
be resolute in the monitoring and development of policies to enhance RCOA participation (Figure 
83).

above, 750 kW – 1.0 MW, and 500 kW – 749 
kW. Once the end-users (contestable 
customers) have the power of choice, it 
marks a turning point for the industry. 
The retail aggregation covering the 750 
kW–1.0 MW demand accordingly relies on 
ERC’s promulgation of requisite 
guidelines to ensure proper application. 
In addition, the DOE and ERC are bent on 
formulating/developing policies to lower 
the threshold to 500 kW and aggregation 
for the specified demand.
F. WHOLESALE ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET DEVELOPMENT
The Market Development Roadmap identified a number of action plans carried out in the shortterm (2017 – 2018) geared towards enhancing the implementation of the WESM. Specifically, 
strategies are anchored on developing policies and monitoring compliance on the following: a) 
WESM design improvements / new market management system (NMMS); b) appointment of 
independent market operator (IMO); c) privatization of the NPC assets; d) policy for embedded 
generators; e) establishment of the Mindanao Electricity Market; f) development of a roadmap 
and policy on the utilization of smart grid and other technologies; g) Renewable Energy Market or 
REM in line with RPS implementation; h) reserve/energy market co-optimization; i) demand 
bidding in the WESM; and j) forwards market/financial transmission rights/day-ahead 
market/derivatives market.
Enhancing the electricity market through policy development is a continuing action plan and 
covers the period from the short- to long-term (2017 – 2040). Policies were also aligned with the 
requirements of RA 9513 (RE Act of 2008), which mandates the preferential treatment and higher 
utilization of RE. 
ASSESSMENT
1. WESM Design Improvements / NMMS
The WESM’s commercial operation in Luzon was on 26 June 2006 while Visayas grid’s integration 
in the WESM commenced on 26 December 2010. The market serves as the venue for trading 
electricity as a commodity and a clearing house to reflect the economic value of electricity for a 
particular period as indicated by a spot price.
The electricity market’s key features are: a) a gross pool system for scheduling contracted and 
uncontracted generation and balancing supply and demand; b) a price determination process, 
which sets the marginal value of all electricity produced and consumed by time and location at all 
nodes; and c) a financial settlement process in which the customers pay for electricity purchases 
and generators receive payments for electricity produced.
Figure 83. POWER SUPPLY ROADMAPThe DOE’s promulgation of DC 2015-10-0015 titled “Providing Policies for Further Enhancement of 
the WESM Design and Operations” in November 2015 prompted the move to develop the WESM 
design and operations enhancements. The enhanced WESM design features the following 
changes: a) shortening of scheduling and pricing intervals from one hour to five minutes, and ex 
ante only pricing to better reflect the changes in supply and demand, and potentially reduce the 
requirement for frequency regulation reserve; b) automatic re-runs when prices reflect constraint 
violations to provide timely disclosure of settlement-ready prices; and, c) hour-ahead projections 
(in addition to the week-ahead and day-ahead projections) to facilitate commitment decisions of 
trading participants.
The PEMC as the Market Operator (MO) procured the NMMS that bears the changes and capable
of: a) automatically detecting non-compliances to the WESM rules, specifically must-offer rule and 
conformity to dispatch standards; and, b) accommodating additional market products (e.g. 
reserve market and forwards market).
The MO also procured, side by side with the NMMS, the Central Registration and Settlement 
System (CRSS), which automates registration and settlement processes for both wholesale and 
retail transactions.
In 2018, the MO carried out the following activities related to the market system: a) roll-over of 
software certification audit activities of the NMMS; b) parallel operations of the NMMS in Luzon 
and Visayas and Trial Operations in Mindanao; and c) soft launch of the CRSS in Luzon and Visayas 
and Trial Operations in Mindanao. The DOE also continued to monitor the completion of the 
software certification audit of the NMMS and carried out various activities to assist the MO in the 
successful deployment of its NMMS and the CRSS. It should be noted that NMMS’ operation is 
dependent on the approval by the ERC of the amended WESM price determination methodology 
(PDM), which reflects the enhancements made in the WESM design.
To date, the Independent Electricity Market Operator of the Philippines (IEMOP), in collaboration 
with the PEMC, DOE and ERC, is finalizing the independent certification audit of the NMMS and 
CRSS to ensure that the new developed software and systems are in accordance with the market 
rules. Further, the PEMC together with the IEMOP conducted market readiness and assessment 
(MRA) through an independent consultant and the final report was presented to the Philippine 
Electricity Market (PEM) Board last 31 July 2019. The IEMOP has been continuously implementing 
the NMMS parallel operation to further test and familiarize the market participants with the new 
NMMS and CRSS.
As mandated by the EPIRA, the DOE continually reviews and promulgates proposed changes to 
the WESM Rules, Retail Rules and Market Manuals to ensure consistency of amendments with the 
objectives of the EPIRA, WESM and RCOA. Under the action plan of developing policies related to 
the WESM design improvements and NMMS, the DOE promulgated nine (9) related DCs in 2018 as 
shown in Table 58.Table 58. PROMULGATED DCs RELATED TO WESM AMENDMENTS TO ENHANCE MARKET DESIGN, DISPUTE

2. Appointment of an Independent Market Operator 
The creation of an IMO stems from the EPIRA provision on the WESM (Section 30). Part of Section 
30 explicitly mentions that the WESM shall be implemented by a Market Operator (MO) in accordance with the WESM rules. The MO shall be an autonomous group, to be constituted by the 
DOE, with equitable representation from electric power industry participants, initially under the 
administrative supervision of the TransCo. The MO shall undertake the preparatory work and initial 
operation of the WESM. Not later than one year after the implementation of the WESM, an 
independent entity shall be formed and the functions, assets and liabilities of the market operator 
shall be transferred to such entity with the joint endorsement of the DOE and the electric power 
industry participants.
The WESM establishment paved the way for the creation of the PEMC120 which served as the 
Autonomous Group Market Operator (AGMO) from August 2004 to 25 September 2018. The DOE 
in coordination with the PEMC undertook several activities to ensure compliance with the required 
establishment of an IMO, one of which is the conduct of studies on appropriate arrangements and 
consultations with the various stakeholders and the Joint Congressional Power Commission 
(JCPC). 
On 17 January 2018, the DOE issued DC 2018-01-0002 titled “Adopting Policies for the Effective and 
Efficiency Transition to the Independent Market Operator for the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market”,
which reiterates that the IMO shall be an independent entity incorporated as a private corporation 
under the Corporation Code of the Philippines. The IMO shall execute the functions of the MO as 
espoused in the EPIRA and its IRR, WESM Rules and Market Manuals and other relevant 
rules/regulations and issuances. The governance function is retained by the PEMC as it will still be 
responsible for overseeing and monitoring the activities of the IMO for it to perform its obligations 
as set out in the WESM Rules and Market Manuals. 
The industry participants of PEMC during its membership meeting on 6 February 2018 endorsed 
the transition to the IMO with the approval of the “Plan for Transition to the IMO of the Philippine 
WESM.” The IEMOP121 was incorporated on 15 May 2018 in the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) with a Company Registration No. CN201807379, and will function separately 
from PEMC. IEMOP’s incorporation was made by individuals who are independent from the 
electric power industry participants and from the government. The initial IEMOP Board was 
selected and confirmed by the PEM Board and the DOE Secretary last 25 June 2018 during the first 
PEMC annual membership meeting. The current Board of Directors of IEMOP122 is seen in Table 59.

An operating agreement was signed between the PEMC and IEMOP on 19 September 2018 for the 
transfer of assets, liabilities, personnel and market operator related functions. This agreement 
defines the parties’ rights and obligations in relation to the transfer and outlines the parties’ roles 
and functions (Table 60). The functions of the MO as provided in the EPIRA and its IRR, WESM 
Rules, WESM Market Manuals and other official issuances were assumed and performed by the 
IEMOP on 26 September 2018 at 00:00 hour.

3. Renewable Energy Market Registrar
The DOE issued the Department of Order (DO) 2019-03-0009 on 18 March 2019 creating a Special 
Task Force that will assess the performance of WESM under its current structure of operations. 
Such assessment covers the following as stated in Section 2: a) assessment of PEMC as the 
governance arm of the WESM; b) assessment of the performance of IEMOP as the IMO; and c) 
over-all performance of WESM.
The Interim Board of IEMOP has a limited term of one (1) year, which expired last 24 June 2019. 
However, the PEM Board recommended to keep the existing Interim Board to prevent disruption 
of services and ensure continued operations of WESM until the assessment results are put into 
place or until a regular Board has been duly elected. The DOE agreed with the said 
recommendation as the conditions for transition to IMO under Section 8 of DC 2018-01-0002 are 
yet to be fulfilled.
3. Establishment of the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market in Mindanao
With WESM already established in Luzon and Visayas, Mindanao remains without an electricity 
market on operation.
On 04 May 2017, the DOE issued DC 2017-05-0009 titled “Declaring the Launch of Wholesale 
Electricity Spot Market (WESM) in Mindanao and Providing for Transition Guidelines.” The said 
Circular provides for the following: a) commencement of registration of the WESM participants; b) 
application of the Interim Mindanao Dispatch Protocol until commercial operations is declared by 
the DOE; and, c) termination of the Interim Mindanao Electricity Market (IMEM). 
On 28 June 2017, WESM was formally launched in Mindanao and it is seen as a medium for providing 
an efficient scheduling, dispatch and settlement of energy withdrawal and injections in the grid. 
The market also embodies competition and transparency that is aimed at the Mindanao electricity 
consumers. This also signaled the commencement of the Trial Operations Program (TOP) that was 
participated in by the MO, System Operation (SO) and trading participants. 
For its part, the DOE monitors all preparatory activities related to the full commercial operation of 
WESM in Mindanao. The DOE conducted FGDs, Information, Education and Communication 
Campaigns, Registration Drive, and Hands-on-Trainings on 2017-2019. As such, the declaration of 
full commercial operation will be made once the criteria set forth is complied with – systems and 
procedure, TOP, operationalization, trainings, PDM and NMMS. The DOE also continues to work with 
both MO and SO to ensure the systems and infrastructure readiness for the WESM’s commercial 
operation.Part of the DOE’s joint endeavors with the other key agencies from the electricity market include 
reconciling of MO-SO on the list of expected WESM trading participants with required metering 
points, the conduct of the study on the impact of over-declaration, proposed improvements on 
TOP workshop design, and the testing of the new back-up system of the NMMS. Corollary to this, 
major interface links between the two (MO and SO) have been established and tested for 
consistency, accuracy and redundancy. The NGCP has also installed the WESM compliant metering 
and real-time monitoring facilities in most trading participants’ sites in Mindanao. Further, 
software certification of all market systems including the critical modules, enhancements, fixes 
and Net Settlement Surplus enhancements for the NMMS and CRSS have been completed.
Another significant criterion in the declaration of commercial operation of WESM in Mindanao is 
the registration of power industry participants. As of August 2020, a total of 24 out of 88 expected 
total participants have completed the registration process with the MO. The MO is currently 
conducting online registration drive to increase the turnout of registration.
The WESM in Mindanao will be operationalized upon the ERC’s approval of the PDM adopting the 
five-minute dispatch interval and certification of market readiness.
4. Policies on Embedded Generators, Ancillary Service and Demand Bidding in the WESM 
Policy development is an integral component in the power sector’s roadmap. In the short-term, 
the DOE formulated policies covering embedded generators and ancillary services (AS). 
Discussions were also started on demand bidding in the WESM.
▪ Embedded Generators
Embedded generators (EGs) pertain to generating units that are indirectly connected to the grid 
through the DUs’ lines or industrial generation facilities that are synchronized with the grid.
With the influx in the use of EGs, the DOE needed to clarify the policies governing decentralized 
generation considering the benefits it may provide, while ensuring that these are operated within 
the framework of centralized power system. To set the context in relation to its optimal operation 
or utilization, the DOE issued on 08 February 2019 DC 2019-02-0003 titled “Providing for the 
Framework Governing the Operations of Embedded Generators.”
As embodied in the Circular, EG shall operate within the following framework: a) provision of 
central dispatch by SO to EGs with material impact to grid operations in the interest of achieving 
economic operation and maintenance of quality, stability, reliability and security of the 
transmission system; b) compliance to the EPIRA and its IRR, PGC, Philippine Distribution Code 
(PDC), WESM Rules and its Market Manuals, Philippine Electrical Code and other pertinent 
issuances by the DOE, ERC and other relevant government instrumentalities having authority over 
the grid reliability and supply security; and c) market share and bilateral contracts limitation under 
Section 45123 of the EPIRA and other relevant regulations issued by the ERC concerning abuse of 
market power and competition.
The Circular also specified the requirements for licensing, connection, market registration and 
participation. It also covers the EGs’ provision of ancillary, as well as metering services. Likewise, 
the Circular provides for the delineation of responsibilities and support of the DUs, MO, 
Transmission Network Provider, SO and the ERC.
123 Cross Ownership
Market Power Abuse and Anti-Competitive Behavior▪ General Framework Policy for Ancillary Services
As a means to effectively utilize ancillary services in the grid, the DOE issued DC 2019-12-0018 on 04 
December 2019 adopting a general framework on the provision and utilization of such services. As 
defined, ancillary service refers to the services necessary to support the transmission of capacity 
and energy from resources to loads, while maintaining reliable operation of the transmission 
system in accordance with good utility practice and the Grid Code to be adopted in accordance 
with the EPIRA. 
The Circular provided a general framework for ancillary service encompassing the issues identified, 
which include among others the following: a) harmonization of the guidelines, rules, and 
regulations concerning the operation of the grid; b) proper accountability among concerned 
entities in the efficient and transparent operation of the grid; c) transparent and cost-effective 
procurement of ancillary services taking into account compliance to reserve requirements of each 
grid; d) co-optimization of energy and reserves in the WESM, through central dispatch and the 
commercial operation of the WESM Reserve Market; and e) transparent accreditation process for 
ancillary services.
The Circular also established the creation of a Technical Working Group (TWG), chaired by the DOE 
and the ERC. The TWG is a recommendatory body to assist in the implementation of the Circular.
▪ Demand Side Bidding in the WESM
The DOE’s initiatives on demand side bidding are based on the initial discussions made with the 
PEMC and on the matter of market derivatives.
A derivative is a contract between two or more parties whose value is in accordance with the 
agreed-upon underlying financial asset (like a security) or set of assets (like an index). The most 
common instruments include bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, market indexes and 
stocks. Derivatives are secondary securities whose value is solely based (derived) on the value of 
the primary security that they are linked to. Commonly used derivatives are futures contract, 
forward contracts, options, swaps and warrants. Derivatives are used either to mitigate risk 
(hedging) or assume risk with the expectation of commensurate reward (speculation)124.
Applying this on the sector leads to the energy derivatives, which are financial instruments wherein 
the underlying assets are energy products including oil, natural gas and electricity. These are 
traded either on an exchange or over-the-counter. Moreover, energy derivatives can be options 
for futures or swap agreements. The value of the derivative varies as a result of the changes in 
price of the energy product125.
5. Development of Power Generation Policies including Rewards-and-Penalty System
The generation sector plays a critical role in maintaining the demand and supply balance of the power 
system. With the goal of enforcing full accountability of the power industry players during forced 
outages, the DOE explored mechanisms that aimed to penalize power generation companies for 
lapses and negligence incurred from their end. This measure is viewed not only to provide safety nets 
to the consumers but also to ensure power supply security to prevent unwanted disruptions and 
mitigate impacts to the power grid.
124 Source: https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/derivative.asp
125 Source: https://www
investopediacom/terms/e/energy-derivativeaspAs early as 2017, the DOE initiated a policy review on the “Causer Pay Policy Program” and subjected 
the same to several FGDs and public consultations among the concerned stakeholders in the electric 
power industry. In the same period, the DOE drafted and finalized the DC on “Causer Pays Mechanism.” 
Under the proposed DC, the penalty system imposes the incremental costs of procuring higher priced 
electricity to the GenCos, DUs and the SO, provided that such forced outages are intentional or has 
transpired as a result of negligent or incompetent operations. 
Recognizing the need to align the draft DC with other cross-cutting policies, the DOE embarked on the 
formulation of a general policy framework for ancillary service.
6. Creating a Roadmap for Smart Grid and Other Technologies
According to the United States-Department of Energy (US-DOE), making the grid “smarter” can be 
achieved through the use of cutting-edge technologies, equipment and controls that communicate 
and work together to deliver electricity more reliably and efficiently. This reduces the frequency 
and duration of power outages, limits storm impacts, and restore service faster when outages 
occur126.
In 2013, the DOE created an Inter-Agency Steering Committee to develop a smart grid roadmap 
with the issuance of DC 2013-03-003 titled “Creating an Inter-Agency Steering Committee for the 
Development and Formulation of a Comprehensive and Holistic Smart Grid Policy Framework and 
Roadmap for the Philippine Electric Power System.”
Among the deliverables of the Inter-Agency Steering Committee as postulated in Section 3 are: a) 
propose a National Strategy for Smart Grid for the period until 2030 with major consideration on 
the possible impact to the price of electricity; b) formulate and prepare the transition policies and 
guidelines for the effective implementation of Smart Grid by all electric power industry 
participants; c) prepare a roadmap for Smart Grid implementation; and, d) formulate customer 
education and information framework for countrywide Smart Grid.

5. Regulatory Support Legal Services (LS)
6. Consumer Empowerment Consumer Welfare and Promotion Office (CWPO)
Taking off from the said Circular, the DOE is cognizant that it is timely to formulate a Smart Grid 
Policy Framework with the following objectives: a) ensure and encourage greater participation 
from power sector stakeholders; and, b) promote technology innovation, business growth and job 
creation. The DOE also created the Smart Grid–Technical Working Groups (SG-TWG), which 
focuses on six (6) key areas: a) power systems operations; b) sustainable and renewable energy; 
c) ICT and cyber security; d) standardization; e) regulatory support; and f) consumer 
empowerment (Table 61).
A Smart Grid Forum was initiated by the DOE in 2017 and followed by one-on-one workshop with 
the leading DUs, as well as FGDs with energy agencies, PIOUs and ECs. The results of these 
126 Source: https://www
energygov/oe/activities/technology-development/grid-modernization-and-smart-griddiscussions served as inputs to the DC to be formulated. The proposed Smart Grid Roadmap 
specifically for the distribution sector is shown in Figure 84.
 
PLANS AND PROGRAMS
 
The course of the medium-term implies that the sector still needs to undertake policy development 
to supplement the initiatives accomplished in the short-term. These policies aspire to enhance the 
already established initiatives – WESM design improvements/NMMS, embedded generators, 
establishment of WESM Mindanao, Reserve/Energy Market Co-optimization, demand bidding in the 
WESM, Forwards 
Market/Financial Transmission 
Rights/Day-ahead 
Market/Derivatives Market.
In the long-term, the market 
development subsector 
undertakes monitoring of 
several initiatives that were 
carried out in the short-term 
and for continuous 
implementation in the 
medium-term, including new 
efforts. Policy development is 
steadily pursued to improve 
further transparency and 
competitiveness of the 
electricity market. Specifically, this covers the WESM rules changes, periodic audit on market 
operations, market operator performance standards, compliance to the WESM rules, metering service 
provider performance standard, and enforcement. Throughout the planning period, the DOE 
warrants a regular capacity-building for the WESM monitoring and assessment.
Figure 84. PROPOSED ROADMAP FOR DISTRIBUTION SECTOR
Figure 85. MARKET DEVELOPMENT ROADMAPG. INSTITUTIONAL AND SUPPORT MECHANISM
The institutional and support mechanism was put in place to sustain the implementation of the 
action plans identified in each power subsector for the planning horizon. As a cross-cutting and 
cross-sectoral initiative, it is primarily attuned to assist in the fulfilment of the EPIRA objectives.
ASSESSMENT
The action plans completed in the short-term dwelled on the following: a) improvement of public 
and stakeholder understanding through IECs; b) provision of support in the conduct of audit and 
review of the WESM relative to market operations, WESM rules, market manuals and retail rules; 
c) maintenance of the electric power database management including the development of interim 
systems and preparation of market operations and variable renewable energy monitoring reports; 
d) submission of reports to oversight – Joint Congressional Power Commission (JCPC) – to ensure 
compliance to the requirements of the EPIRA and other laws; and e) enhancement of power 
planning, specifically in generation and transmission with the aid of modelling tools and 
optimization software.
PLANS AND PROGRAMS
Over the medium-term, the 
objective is two folds – develop 
smart grid roadmap and policy 
framework and enhance power 
development planning. The 
action plans from the mediumto long-term mirror what were 
initially implemented and 
accomplished in the short-term. 
It is deemed fundamental to be 
continuously executed to bring 
about performance efficiency in 
the industry so that services 
delivered to stakeholders and 
consumers adhere to quality, reliability, affordability, and security. Moreover, these action plans 
put emphasis on the realization of the EPIRA’s objectives for the electricity industry.
1. Smart Grid Roadmap and Policy
The smart grid policy and roadmap are among the action plans specified under market 
development for the short-term. Advancing from DC 2013-03-003 wherein an Inter-Agency 
Steering Committee was created, the DOE led various discussions with concerned stakeholders of 
which the results were incorporated as inputs in the draft DC. The draft Smart Grid Circular was 
presented to public consultations and posted on DOE’s website for further comments of 
stakeholders. Correspondingly, an initial roadmap has been created for the distribution sector, 
known as the National Smart Distribution Utility Roadmap (SDUR).
Correspondingly, the DOE promulgated on 12 March 2020 DC 2020-02-0003 titled “Providing a 
National Smart Grid Policy Framework for the Philippine Electric Power Industry and Roadmap for 
Distribution Utilities.” The criteria to be adopted as the country’s power system transitions into a 
Figure 86. INSTITUTIONAL AND SUPPORT MECHANISM ROADMAPsmart grid by 2040 are safety, reliability, efficiency, flexibility/sustainability, resiliency, and 
consumer empowerment.
2. Enhancement of Power Development Planning
As a continuing action plan over the planning period, enhancement of power development 
planning is critical in the DOE’s mandate. The DOE is required to formulate and update annually 
the PDP, which details the electricity demand and supply outlook of the country. Improvement in 
supply expansion planning capability entails the procurement and application of power planning 
tools, specific for generation and transmission.
3. Assessment of Industry Stakeholder’s Performance and Development of Policies and Programs 
for Greater Efficiency
As an approach in the evaluation of industry performance, the DOE is set to continue conducting 
PAA activities. It also functions as a mechanism to gauge the performance and efficiency of power 
facilities based on mandated operational standards.
4. Continuous Monitoring, Review and Evaluation of the EPIRA Implementation
The DOE, after a series of FGDs and public consultations with the stakeholders, drafted a DC titled, 
“Amending Certain Provisions of the Rules and Regulations to Implement the EPIRA.”
The draft Circular proposes to, among others, (a) Clarify the responsibilities of the DOE, ERC, 
TransCo and its buyer/concessioner relative to the TDP; (b) Clarification on the mandate of the NEA 
relative to its authority and responsibility over the ECs towards viably operating in the deregulated 
electricity market and ensuring the total electrification of the country; (c) Alignment of the ERC 
mandate to ensure that Suppliers would comply to rules concerning anti-competitive behavior and 
market share limitations, including unbundling provisions as required under Section 36 of the Law; 
(d) Emphasis on the compliance of generation companies including embedded generators and 
distribution utilities to the PGC, PDC and WESM Rules; (e) Rationalization of the subsidies for 
missionary electrification; (f) Authority for TransCo or its buyer/concessionaire to operate, 
maintain, and develop the transmission system in any SPUG area that has been identified by the 
DOE as viable; (g) Separation of accounts of related business of distribution and transmission 
utilities subsidization among related businesses; (h) Determination of remote and unviable areas 
for the provision of electricity; (i) Exemption from the imposition of universal charge (UC) for selfgenerating entities; (j) Rationalization of lifeline rates subsidy; and (k) Clarification on the PSALM 
mandates on the administration of UC.
▪ Privatization of NPC Assets
The EPIRA mandates the overall restructuring of the country’s electricity industry and calls for the 
privatization of NPC. The move for privatization was deemed to introduce competition and level 
the playing field in both generation and supply sectors. The government’s privatization efforts 
primarily pinpoint to power generating facilities, as well as the power supply contracts. Majority 
of the privatization activities done by the government were from 2007–2016 wherein major assets 
of NPC, IPP Contracts and transmission assets were turned over to the private sector.The privatization level of the NPC’s 
generating assets in Luzon and Visayas is 
already at 87.0 percent as of April 2019 
wherein 4,364.30 MW of the 5,014.30 MW 
are already privatized (Figure 87). The 
remaining 13.0 percent for privatization is 
the Malaya Thermal Power Plant (MTPP) 
with a capacity of 650 MW.
On the IPP contracts, privatization was 
recorded at 78.3 percent of the total 
contracted capacities equivalent to 
3,415.00 MW of the 4,362.92 MW (Figure 
88). This covers coal (Sual and Pagbilao), 
hydro (San Roque, Bakun), natural gas 
(Ilijan) and geothermal (Unified Leyte 
Strips of Energy).
The revenue generated by PSALM from 
the privatization of generation assets, 
transmission business and IPP contracted 
capacities totaled PhP 910.16 billion. 
Actual collections as of April 2019 stood at 
PhP 571.43 Billion and with a collectible 
balance of PhP 338.73 Billion127. PSALM 
was able to achieve 100.0 percent 
collection stemming from the auctioned 
generating assets and decommissioned 
plants. The remaining collectibles are from 
the balances of TransCo’s transmission 
assets (concession fees) and appointment 
of IPPA. The utilization of the privatization 
proceeds was solely used for the 
liquidation of PSALM’s financial 
obligations as provided under the EPIRA.
▪ Malaya Thermal Power Plant128
The privatization package of MTPP in line with the DOE’s directive to PSALM and as relayed by the 
latter to the DOF includes the land underlying the plant with an estimated area of 26.28 hectares 
(ha) consisting of five parcels of land registered under the Republic of the Philippines.
Four bidders were declared compliant by PSALM-Bids and Award Committee (BAC) on 28 
November 2018 with all the requirements of the documentary deliverables. The compliant bidders 
are: 1) AC Energy Inc.; 2) D.M. Wenceslao & Associates, Inc.; 3) DMCI Power Corporation; and 4) 
FGEN Reliable Energy Holdings, Inc. The Final Asset Purchase Agreement was issued to the 
qualified bidders, after a meeting held with them. PSALM also issued Supplemental Bid Bulletin 
No. 6 amending the bid submission deadline from 24 April 2019 to 14 June 2019. This was

▪ Procurement of the Third-Party Consultant for the Valuation of MTPP
PSALM’s Board of Directors directed the procurement of a third-party consultant to undertake the 
valuation of assets. Three bidders participated during the bidding held on 04 March 2019, namely 
a) Price Waterhouse Coopers (PWC), b) Beyond Energy, Inc. (BEI), and c) Lantau Group.
On 15 March 2019, the PSALM-BAC declared PWC as the winning bidder with the highest rated 
technical proposal, and subsequently approved by the Head of the Procuring Entity. PSALM issued 
the Notice of Award to PWC on 22 April 2019. In line with this, the timeline for MTPP’s privatization 
activities has also been adjusted. 
▪ Privatization Schedule
To date, eight (8) generating assets are still up for privatization with a total capacity of 1,651.1 MW 
(Table 62). The privatization of the Agus-Pulangi hydro complexes will be subject to consultation 
with Congress and PSALM Board’s policy direction. On the appointment of IPPAs, there are still 
three plants remaining with a total capacity of 1,225.92 MW, the largest of which is the CalirayaBotocan-Kalayaan (CBK) hydroelectric power plant with a capacity of 797.92 MW (Table 63).

H. MISSIONARY ELECTRIFICATION
Consistent with its overall mandate and the policy objectives of the EPIRA, the DOE remains firm 
in fulfilling its commitment to perform missionary electrification functions throughout the country. 
In pursuit of this thrust, the DOE continues to develop key policies, programs and strategic 
measures to ensure the delivery of quality, reliable, secure and affordable electricity service in 
marginalized communities located in far flung and remote areas.
In support of the government’s total electrification agenda, the DOE is putting best efforts to bring 
missionary areas into commercial viability level, to contribute in attaining inclusive growth and development. Relatedly, to realize policy reforms in the power sector, the DOE is exploring for 
feasible measures to rationalize the subsidy mechanism, introduce necessary improvements in 
system operations including the modernization and entry of emerging and efficient technologies 
across all small island grids.
ASSESSMENT
1. Development of the Omnibus Guidelines for Off-Grid Areas
The DOE crafted the Omnibus Guidelines for Off-Grid Areas anchored on three main objectives that 
aims to: (1) accelerate access to sustainable energy; (2) rationalize the Universal Charge for 
Missionary Electrification (UCME); and (3) improve the efficiency, sufficiency and reliability of 
electricity services in off-grid areas.
Prior to its approval and signing on 25 January 2019, the DC has gone through a series of 
preparatory activities, such as FGDs and public consultations, which were participated in by 
government agencies, electric power industry participants and other stakeholders involved in 
missionary electrification as presented in Table 64. The Omnibus Guidelines for Off-Grid Areas 
became effective on 10 March 2019 following its publication in the Business World and the Daily 
Tribune on 22 February 2019.

As a comprehensive policy governing off-grid power development, the completion of the Omnibus 
Guidelines encapsulates the key accomplishments based on the short-term targets under the 
missionary electrification roadmap.
▪ Ensure Adequate Supply in Off-Grid Areas
To date, the NPC-SPUG still supplies majority of the power requirements in the off-grid areas 
despite having a Private Sector Participation (PSP) Program in place. As such, the timely 
completion and implementation of capacity additions and uprating projects are imperative to 
sustain power supply security in the islands. 
Along with this effort, the NPC-SPUG took advantage of EO30 by applying 32 of its power 
generation projects in missionary areas as EPNS. With foreseen contributions of bringing positive economic impacts to the off-grid islands, the proposed power generation projects have been 
granted with CEPNS as listed in Table 65.

On the other hand, one private power provider, the DMCI Power Corporation has also been 
granted with a CEPNS for its 15-MW coal power plant project in Masbate.
As CEPNS holders, NPC-SPUG and DMCI Power Corporation are entitled to the full benefits of EO30 
for the timely implementation of their proposed off-grid power generation projects.
▪ Conduct Policy Studies on Optimal Energy Mix for Off-grid Areas
As part of its continuing advocacy to identify and establish the optimal energy mix for small islands 
and isolated grids, the DOE endeavors the formulation of a sound Missionary Electrification 
Development Plan (MEDP). Relative to this, the policy on optimal energy mix is embodied in the 
priority goals and objectives of the MEDP, in conjunction with DC 2018-08-0024 or the “RPS for Off-Grid.” Currently, the DOE has ongoing efforts focused on the generation planning for the five 
island provinces namely, Mindoro, Palawan, Masbate, Marinduque and Romblon.
Along with this thrust, the DOE is assisted by the European Union – Access to Sustainable Energy 
Programme (EU-ASEP) in conducting studies and facilitating capacity building activities to help 
improve off-grid operations as part of the Programme’s Technical Assistance (TA) component. 
Among the activities undertaken by the DOE and the ASEP in 2018 include the study to improve the 
efficiency of the NPC-SPUG diesel power plants, and the training on the enhanced Simplified 
Planning Tool (SPT) for the optimization of supply mix.
▪ Rationalize and improve UCME Subsidy System
As a key intervention to attain countryside development, off-grid areas are intensely supported by 
a subsidy mechanism through the UCME, which is being passed on to all electricity consumers. 
With the objective of easing power rates that burden all end-users, the rationalization of existing 
tariffs including the phase-out of the UCME subsidy mechanism is one of the salient provisions 
underscored in the Omnibus Guidelines for Off-Grid Areas.
In line with this, the DOE identified feasible measures to propel the rationalization of the UCME 
mechanism, which include: (a) tariff differentiation among customers and missionary areas; (b) 
methodology review for the determination of the True Cost Generation Rate (TCGR) and 
Subsidized Approved Generation Rate (SAGR) for the NPP Program; (c) methodology review for 
determination of the Full Cost Recovery Rate (FCRR) and Subsidized Approved Retail Rate (SARR) 
for the QTP Program; (d) provisional review of the cash generation-based incentive for RE 
Developers aligned with the context and objectives of UCME; and (e) interconnection of SPUG 
islands to the main grids of Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao or intra-connection among adjacent small 
islands not connected to the main grids.
▪ Performance Assessment and Benchmarking
With the goal of improving small grid power system operations, the DOE has undertaken PAA 
activities in three off-grid areas in Luzon. These activities enabled the DOE to wholly assess the 
power situation including the operational efficiencies of the generation, transmission and 
distribution system facilities serving small islands and isolated grids.
As a priority measure, the main results of the off-grid PAA were instrumental in the formulation of 
the Omnibus Guidelines for Off-Grid Areas that facilitated the establishment of benchmark data 
and information with respect to technical standards and operating guidelines of small grid 
systems.
Activities related to the conduct of PAA in MASELCO on 18-29 June 2018Along with this initiative, the DOE piloted its first off-grid PAA in Oriental Mindoro Electric 
Cooperative, Inc. (ORMECO) in November 2017 followed by a post-audit activity, which was 
conducted in the last quarter of 2018. Likewise, the DOE implemented the same undertaking in 
Masbate Electric Cooperative, Inc. (MASELCO) in June 2018. The last off-grid PAA was carried out 
in the First Catanduanes Electric Cooperative, Inc. (FICELCO) in July 2018.
As a continuing program of the DOE, the results of future PAA activities will primarily serve as firm 
bases in identifying appropriate policy measures and programs to further improve the reliability, 
efficiency and modernization of off-grid power systems.
PLANS AND PROGRAMS
The issuance of the Omnibus 
Guidelines for Off-Grid Areas is 
a bold move of the 
government in setting a clear 
track for power development 
in small islands and isolated 
grids and unviable areas. Now 
that the governing policy is 
already in place, the DOE 
concentrates on harmonizing 
efforts among energy 
agencies, including the 
stakeholders mandated with 
missionary electrification 
functions, to ensure the timely 
and effective implementation 
of the said policy within the medium- to long-term horizons.
At the early stage of the policy execution, the DOE prioritizes the rationalization and the 
enhancement of the UCME subsidy mechanism to cushion the potential and encumbering impacts 
to electricity users in off-grid areas. As an instrument of social justice, the UCME subsidy 
mechanism will be reviewed and reformulated to enable the marginalized consumers to afford the 
cost of electricity and use it efficiently. 
Considering also that a number of off-grid islands are regularly stricken by calamities, the DOE 
pushes for resiliency policies to fortify existing and upcoming power facilities serving small island 
grids. Coherent with the DOE’s energy resiliency thrust, this action plan also serves as a 
complementing strategy to ensure energy security in the off-grid areas.
To address the pressing concern for a stable power supply in the small islands, the DOE strictly 
advocates for stronger institutional cooperation between the NEA and NPC-SPUG toward the 
fulfilment of their sworn mandates. Essential in their mandates are the timely programming and 
delivery of respective plans, programs, and missionary electrification related projects in off-grid 
areas, among others. Likewise, full compliance to administrative and regulatory policies to include 
the fair and transparent execution of CSP for power supply sustainability needs to be efficiently 
enforced.
As a continuing program of the DOE, the MEDP is periodically formulated to embark on the 
generation and overall planning for off-grid areas. Along with this, the DOE undertakes various 
 Figure 89. MISSIONARY ELECTRIFICATION ROADMAPcapacity building programs to boost the technical competencies of the DUs in off-grid with respect 
to power development planning. Relatedly, the DOE will develop and maintain a suitable off-grid 
power monitoring system, and work on the necessary improvements accordingly, and as the need 
arises.
In the long run, the DOE firmly monitors the implementation of the Omnibus Guidelines for OffGrid Areas and conducts policy review to assess its applicability, consistency and relevance with 
the overall energy agenda of the DOE.
I. TOTAL ELECTRIFICATION PROGRAM
The government continues to put premium on the importance of expanding electricity access as 
this remains in the energy sector development agenda. Viewed as a tool that improves the quality 
of life of Filipinos, the sector is driven with the goal of attaining 100.0 percent electrification of 
unserved and underserved129 areas in the country by 2022 based on 2015 Census of Population. The 
government has formulated the Total Electrification Program (TEP) with the main objective of 
providing electricity to all households by 2040.
With the President’s directive to accelerate electrification by 2020, the Total Electrification Master 
Plan has been crafted under the TEP. As a concrete step, the Task Force E-Power Mo! (TFEM) was 
created by virtue of DO2018-05-0010 signed on 24 May 2018. The Task Force, chaired by the DOE, 
is responsible for overseeing the government’s TEP and ensuring that electricity reaches the 
unserved and underserved communities within the franchise areas of the DUs/ECs. The TFEM is 
also tasked to develop the National Unified Strategy for TEP based on the consolidated and 
reviewed comprehensive Total Electrification Master Plan of the individual DU/EC. The plan 
likewise pushes for increased private sector participation specifically on areas where the DUs/ECs 
cannot perform their responsibilities. 
The TFEM has identified three major forms of electrification programs – household electrification, 
grid electrification and off-grid electrification. Household and grid electrification programs include 
the following strategies: a) the provision of house wiring subsidy for unenergized households 
situated in areas with distribution facilities such as the DOE’s Nationwide Intensification of 
Household Electrification (NIHE); b) extension of distribution line facilities to unserved areas such 
as NEA’s Sitio Electrification Program (SEP) and the Barangay Line Enhancement Program (BLEP). 
On the other hand, off-grid electrification programs include: a) DU’s installation of individual 
photovoltaic – solar home systems (PV-SHS) under the DOE and the EU-ASEP PV Mainstreaming; 
b) implementation of mini/micro-grid system through potential entry of private sector as QTP, 
partner in a joint venture agreement (JVA), and the NPC-SPUG Mini-Grid Scheme.
The obligation of providing electricity service to areas throughout the country remains with the 
DUs. Electricity must be supplied in the least cost manner to its captive market subject to the 
collection of retail rate duly approved by ERC130. The provision of universal service by the DUs also 
includes unviable areas and if there is no viable solution, these areas may be transferred to another 
DU (if any is available). The performance of the DUs particularly its obligation in electrification of
its franchise area is overseen by the NEA.
129Underserved area refers to those areas with less than 24-hour electricity service. 
130 Section 23 of RA 9136The electrification solution is opened to QTPs if the DUs are unable to serve the remote and 
unviable villages131. The DOE has the responsibility of declaring these remote and unviable areas 
that cannot be served by the DUs open for private sector participation. As support to the total 
electrification program and for an environment that is more conducive to private sector 
participation particularly in unviable areas, the DOE issued DC 2019-11-0015 or the Revised QTP 
Guidelines on 22 November 2019. The policy basically updates and revises the existing guidelines 
on QTP participation.
The NPC-SPUG’s role in electrification comes when neither a DU nor QTP cannot provide electricity 
service in an area. It is responsible for providing power generation and its associated power 
delivery systems in areas that are not connected to the grid and cannot be serviced by the DUs and 
other QTPs132.
The short-term targets espoused in the TEP are as follows: a) process, evaluate and approve 
projects that contribute to the attainment of 90.0 percent household electrification by 2017 (based 
on 2010 Census133); b) monitoring of household electrification development plan (HEDP) programs; 
c) establish off-grid database management system; and d) develop proposal for NIHE Phase 2.
ASSESSMENT
1. Process, Evaluate and Approve Projects that Contribute to the Attainment of Household 
Electrification Target by 2017 
The energy sector in the short-term was guided with the goal of attaining its household 
electrification target – that is 90.0 percent of the total households in the country have electricity 
access by 2017. 
As early as December 2016, the DOE together with NEA has already reach the 90.0 percent 
household electrification level based on the 2010 Census of Population.
In December 2017, the country posted a household electrification level of 91.1 percent wherein a 
total of 20,936,498 households out of the potential 22,984,971134 have access to electricity. This is 
translated to 2,048,473 households without electricity service throughout the country. Luzon 
registered the highest electrification level at 99.9 percent, while Visayas and Mindanao had 89.5 
percent and 70.2 percent electrification levels, respectively (Figure 89 and Table 66).

The NIHE program was implemented from 2015 to 
2017. However, with the need to further expand the 
program, the DOE carried out a review and 
evaluation of its existing mechanism to further 
enhance and streamline the requirements. In the 
later part of 2017, the DOE issued the 
implementation guidelines that included the 
streamlined process in project approval, 
implementation and monitoring. In effect, approval 
was made to 13 out of the 18 projects under 2018 
NIHE with a total beneficiary of 81,770 households. 
The ECs with approved projects are: Ilocos Sur 
Electric Cooperative (ISECO), Ifugao Electric 
Cooperative (IFELCO), Pangasinan III Electric 
Cooperative (PANELCO III), Marinduque Electric 
Cooperative (MARELCO), Antique Electric Cooperative (ANTECO), Iloilo III Electric Cooperative

Misamis Oriental I Electric Cooperative (MORESCO I), Surigao del Sur I Electric Cooperative 
(SURSECO I), and Zamboanga del Sur I Electric Cooperative (ZAMSURECO I) (Table 69). These ECs 
signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the DOE for the project implementation within 
their franchise areas.

services to those who have been deprived of electricity access.
Consumers who have electricity service are helping other consumers or would be consumers as a 
portion of the payment in electricity bills (the Universal Charge – Missionary Electrification) is 
utilized in subsidizing electricity in missionary or off-grid areas. Electrification is a program that 
enhances local development and transcends to every consumer.
PLANS AND PROGRAMS
 
For the medium-term, the TEP 
has the objective of developing 
and implementing plans and 
programs in the attainment of 
total electrification of targeted 
households by 2022 (based on 
2015 Census). In the long-term, it 
is envisioned that electricity 
service is provided to all 
households throughout the 
country. Continuing action plans 
will be pursued within the 
medium- to long-term period, 
which include: a) monitoring of 
implementation of total 
electrification plans and 
programs; and b) provision of 
support and assistance to communities hosting generating facilities and/or energy resources.
1. Development, Monitoring and Implementation of Total Electrification Plans and Programs
Cognizant of the total electrification target by 2022, the DOE is unwavering in the implementation 
of its identified electrification strategies in both grid and off-grid areas. This entails the 
management of the DOE approved projects and programs covering the following: a) TEP, in 
collaboration with the NEA and NPC-SPUG, as the project implementers; b) PV Mainstreaming both 
by the DOE and the EU-ASEP; c) Electrification Fund (EF) projects under ER 1-94 of the DUs; and d) 
QTP.
The TFEM continuously ensures that electricity access reaches communities that remain unserved 
and underserved by the DUs. Thus, the DUs are enjoined to execute their respective Total 
Electrification Masterplans outlining the appropriate electrification strategies and fund resources. 
A pragmatic and timely approach in project implementation greatly contributes in attaining the 
objective of providing electricity access to the targeted households in the country.
Figure 92. ELECTRIFICATION ROADMAP2. Provide support and assistance to Communities Hosting Generating Facilities and/or Energy 
Resources
On ER 1-94137, the DOE is on the standpoint to continue providing support and assistance to host 
communities from medium- to long-term period. It may be noted that in 2018, two pertinent 
policies on ER 1-94 were issued – DC 2018-03-0005138 and DC 2018-08-0021139. The former, 
promulgated on 20 March 2018, recognizes the rights of indigenous cultural communities (ICCs) / 
indigenous peoples (IPs) in their ancestral domains to have equitable share from the financial 
benefits under ER 1-94. The latter, promulgated on 23 August 2018, effects the transfer of financial 
benefits to the DUs/ECs and to host LGUs and ICCs/IPs. The Circular stipulates that the EF 
component will be remitted directly to the DUs/ECs, while the development and livelihood fund 
(DLF) and reforestation, watershed management, health and/or environment enhancement fund 
(RWMHEEF) will be remitted to the host LGUs and ICCs/IPs. 
To guide the ICCs/IPs in availing their share, the DOE issued DC 2019-06-0010140 on 14 June 2019 
specifying the administrative operating guidelines (AOG) to facilitate the transfer and utilization of 
financial benefits by the ICCs/IPs whose ancestral domains are host to generation facilities and/or 
energy resources. 
▪ ER 1-94 Status
The ER 1-94 is a program that intends to recompense 
for the contribution made by communities hosting 
energy generating facilities and/or energy 
resources. The promulgation of DC 2018-08-0021 in 
August 2018 provides the guidelines on the direct 
remittance of financial benefit to host beneficiaries,
while DC 2019-06-0010 specified the AOG to 
facilitate the transfer and utilization of the funds. 
As a means for host LGUs to have additional fund source in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
DOE issued DC 2020-04-0008 on 07 April 2020 titled “Rationalizing the Utilization of ER 1-94 by 
LGUs in Response to COVID-19 Public Health Emergency.” The Circular stipulates that all available 
and unremitted ER 1-94 Funds (as of December 2019) that is with DOE and concerned GenCos shall 
be immediately distributed to host LGUs in order to have a readily available fund for undertaking 
COVID-19 related responses. An Advisory was also issued last 14 July 2020 for the implementation 
of the said Circular and to provide clarification on particular sections, as well as for the continuity 
of processes and activities.
For the period September 2019 to 12 August 2020, the DOE remitted a total of PhP 2.9 billion of ER 
1-94 funds to host LGUs with half of the remitted amount comprised the EF (Table 70).
137 The provision of benefits to communities hosting generating facilities or energy resource development projects is stipulated in Section 5 (i) of RA 7638, 
Section 66 of RA 9136, and Rule 29 of the EPIRA-IRR.
138 “Prescribing the Guidelines Recognizing the Rights of Indigenous Cultural Communities (ICCs) / Indigenous Peoples (IPs) in their Ancestral Domain and

Investments in the power sector must be highly promoted to ensure that power supply remains 
steadily available for the production and delivery of electricity to fuel economic growth. One 
important aspect for the future of power sector is the need to meet the necessary investment 
requirements for expansion of power generation capacity and development of required additional
infrastructure to strengthen the existing power system. 
The restructuring of the country’s power sector paved the way for a more competitive electricity 
supply market as the government opened the opportunities of financing power projects to private 
investors. Considering that power projects are highly leveraged investment undertaking, building 
up substantial portfolios of investment in the sector should be of greater interest to encourage 
greater capital investments and private sector participation.
Table 71 shows the investment requirement in the generation sub sector and the capacity addition 
per scenario to support the expanding electricity demand. The estimated financing requirements
are slated for building new power plants to augment existing capacities and ensure adequate and 
reliable power supply. Under the Reference Scenario, the total capital investment needed to 
develop additional generation capacities amounts to USD 104,650 million. With higher shares of 
renewables in the capacity addition, the Clean Energy Scenario (CES) is expected to be more 
expensive by 18.5 percent (USD 19,325 million), reaching USD 123,975 million due to high upfront 
cost in building more renewable power plants.

To increase the grid capacity and complement the entry of new generating facilities, the 
transmission sub sector will need to invest USD 7,011.82 million covering the period 2019 to 2025 
(Table 72). These projects are mostly comprised of upgrade and expansion of transmission 
backbones and development of island interconnections. For ongoing projects, only the remaining 
investments needed to complete the projects are considered. For projects already filed and to be 
filed before the ERC for approval, some of the estimated investments only represent portion of 
the total project cost as there are still additional investments needed beyond 2025 to complete 
such projects.

other future projects still need further assessment to estimate the total project cost for 
engineering, procurement, and construction.
For the benefit of the customers, increasing network efficiency and improving the performance of 
distribution services also necessitate large amounts of new investments to achieve long-term
reliability. Table 73 enumerates the needed investments for distribution development projects 
planned to be implemented in the next ten years (2019-2028).

The estimated capital spending to further develop the country’s distribution sector amounts to 
USD 16,423 million. More than half (54.2 percent) of the total cost is allotted for electrification 
projects. This is followed by network projects taking 40.0 percent (USD 6,571 million) and mostly 
consisting of additional substation and sub-transmission facilities, upgrading and rehabilitation of 
the existing distribution system. The remaining is shared out to non-network projects which range 
from acquisition of property, equipment, safety gadgets, software, vehicles, and others that assist 
DUs in its operations and delivery of services. 
Investments in the power sector have been supporting the growth of the economy by stimulating
potential jobs related to construction and operation of power sector’s infrastructure or services. 
Likewise, the power sector’s skilled workforce generally has higher level of incomes thus 
contributing higher spending per capita for the economy. 
The total potential employment associated with power generation projects is expected to be 
around 515, 881 jobs under the Reference Scenario (Table 74). The Clean Energy Scenario
necessitates an additional of 110,192 employment in comparison with the Reference Scenario, 
equivalent to 626,073 estimated job opportunities. Since Clean Energy Scenario needs more 
capacity additions due to high share of renewables, the required workforce will considerably 
increase especially during the construction and installation phases. Renewable energy 
technologies tend to be more labor intensive as revealed by several available related literatures 
and studies. It must be noted that the job generation presented only reflects the projected 
number of jobs for the construction and operation and maintenance activities.Table 74. ESTIMATED JOB GENERATION IN POWER GENERATION PROJECTS

 4. Construction period varies per plant technology.The energy efficiency and conservation (EE&C) is fast evolving into a key policy solution to high 
energy cost, energy security and the threat of climate change. It is also seen as the heart of the 
consumers’ participation to ensure sustainable growth and development of the country’s energy 
future.
The DOE crafted the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Roadmap in 2018 with the overall
objective of reducing energy intensity – that is the energy consumed per unit of the Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP). The Roadmap highlights the strategies and approaches to trim down energy 
intensity across economic sectors – residential, transportation, industrial, commercial and 
agricultural. This puts EE&C initiatives at the core of consumer protection programs, empowering
energy users to be more proactive and intelligent in terms of energy choices. The EE&C also 
provides consumers the means to save on their energy cost, while contributing to the macroeconomic goal of de-carbonizing the environment.
With relevant policies and strategies now in place on EE&C, it may not take long for it to be 
considered as an energy resource that is equally important as other existing supply resources, 
even considering it as part of the Philippine energy mix by 2040.
A. ASSESSMENT
1. Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act of 2019
RA 11285 (EE&C Act) establishes a framework for introducing and institutionalizing fundamental 
policies on EE&C, promoting the efficient and judicious use of all energy resources, and increasing 
the use of energy-efficient and renewable-energy technologies. All national government agencies
ENERGY EFFICIENCY 
AND CONSERVATION 
Republic Act (RA) 11285 or the “Act Institutionalizing Energy Efficiency and Conservation, Enhancing the Efficient Use 
of Energy, and Granting Incentives to Energy Efficiency and Conservation Projects” was signed by President Rodrigo R. 
Duterte on 12 April 2019. This long-awaited policy measure came as a result of the DOE’s relentless effort to pursue its 
advocacy to curb energy demand without sacrificing economic productivity. 
Secretary Alfonso G. Cusi signed the Implementing Rules and Regulations (Department Circular/DC 2019-11-0014) on 22 
November 2019, and became effective on 21 December 2019. The EE&C Act shall serve as a measure to create 
institutional framework at different levels of government to promote energy efficiency and conservation practices 
in the country.(NGAs), government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs), local government units (LGUs) 
and state universities and colleges (SUCs) are directed to adopt energy efficiency measures and 
ensure implementation of such in their daily operations – offices, facilities, and vehicles, among 
others. The issuance of Department Order (DO) 2020-01-0001 created an Inter-Agency Energy 
Efficiency and Conservation Committee (IAEECC) to evaluate and approve government energy 
efficiency projects, as well as provide strategic direction for the implementation of the 
Government Energy Management Program (GEMP). The new Guidelines for GEMP was signed by 
Secretary A. G. Cusi as Chairman of IAEECC.
The conduct of Energy Audit Spot Check is a regular activity of the DOE for NGAs, GOCCs, LGUs, 
and SUCs to ensure government compliance to GEMP. This task has transitioned into the Virtual 
Energy Audit Spot Check relative to the “new normal” activities of DOE.
In 2018141, the GEMP initiative of the DOE was able to save the country about 6.55 GWh of electricity 
which is equivalent to PhP 52.32 million in monetary savings and reduction of 3,351.4 tons of carbon 
dioxide in the environment.
A National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Plan (NEECP)142 will also be formulated to serve as 
the national comprehensive framework on EE&C programs detailing sectoral targets and 
strategies, as well as a monitoring and evaluation scheme. The EE&C Act empowers the LGUs to 
develop and implement Local Energy Efficiency and Conservation Plan (LEECP) which should be
aligned with NEECP. Likewise, an Energy Efficiency Conservation Office (EECO) will be established 
to oversee and monitor the implementation of EE&C plans and programs under the GEMP.
Among the salient features of the EE&C Act include the following:
▪ Categorization of establishments based on their energy consumption threshold as Type 1 
(o.5 to 4.0 GWh annual consumption) and Type 2 (>4.0 GWh annual consumption);
▪ Designation of a Certified Energy Conservation Officer (CECO) for Type 1, and a Certified 
Energy Manager (CEM) for Type 2;
▪ Development and compliance to Minimum Energy Performance (MEP) standards for the 
commercial, industrial, and transport sectors, and energy-consuming products covering
appliances, lighting, electrical equipment, and machinery, among others; 
▪ Development and enforcement of a mandatory energy efficiency rating and labeling 
system for energy-consuming products (i.e. air-conditioners, refrigerators, lighting 
products and television sets), and performance labeling for vehicle manufacturers, 
importers, and dealers;
▪ Implementation of the Guidelines on Energy Conserving Design on Buildings for the 
construction of new buildings by the LGUs; and,
▪ Submission of the Annual Energy Consumption and Conservation Report (ECCR) by the 15th
of April of every year to the DOE.
141 In 2019, recorded energy savings from the implementation of GEMP was at 5.112 GWh of electricity, equivalent to PhP 49.5 million in monetary savings. 
This also reduced about 2,617 tons of carbon dioxide emission from the environment
142 The DOE has been implementing the National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Program since 2004, which covers Information, Education and 
Communication CampaignEnergy Labelling ProgramEnergy Management Program and GEMPamong othersIn the MEP and labelling provisions, no manufacturers, distributors and importers are allowed to 
sell energy-consuming products (covered by the Philippine Energy Labelling Program or PELP) 
unless t compliant with MEP and labelling requirements. 
2. Cross-Sectoral Energy Performance and Rating Systems
The EE&C Act sets up a data collection mechanism where large energy-consuming sectors 
(commercial, industrial and transport) shall submit to the DOE their respective annual 
consumption reports. To effectively implement this 
provision, a comprehensive data collection 
framework shall be required to guide how data will 
be managed and monitored. Moreover, a National 
Energy Consumption database will be developed to 
serve as a reference in the formulation and adoption 
of MEP across the different sectors. 
The DOE, in partnership with the DPWH, is updating the Philippine Green Building Code, specifically 
the Chapter on Energy Efficiency in Buildings which comprises sections on the building envelop 
and the mechanical and electrical systems. On the other hand, the Building for Ecologically 
Responsive Design Excellence (BERDE) Green Building Rating (GBR) System was expanded and 
enhanced through the partnership between the DOE and the Philippine Green Building Council 
(PGBC). This will ensure the use of efficient technologies and measures in building design, such as 
the development of appropriate building measures for roofs and insulation to bring down heat 
from the atmosphere, thereby reducing demand for cooling. 
Benchmarking and ratings for building 
information and reporting are also in the 
Roadmap. This involves the monitoring 
of energy consumption and collection of 
relevant data, which can be useful in the 
formulation of new policy directions by 
the government to enhance energy 
efficiency measures.
3. Integration of EE&C at the Local 
Government Units 
The DOE, in partnership with the 
Development Academy of the 
Philippines (DAP), aims to assist LGUs in
integrating concrete EE&C programs, 
projects and supporting policies into 
their respective local development 
plans and LEECPs.
Its objectives are to: (1) promote 
mainstreaming of EE&C in all energydemand sectors at the LGU level; (2) 
guide the LGUs in developing EE&C 
action plans and policies for 
implementation and integration into 
Mainstreaming Energy Efficiency and Conservation at the LGU Level
Baguio City
Batangas City
In 2020, the Memorandum Circular 2020-05-0001
was signed specifying the Rules on the Submission 
of the Annual Energy Consumption Report for 
Designated Establishments in the Commercial, 
Industrial and Transport Sectors.their local development plans; and (3) monitor and document best practices of LGU-related EE&C
measures.
In 2018143, the DOE conducted six (6) seminars on mainstreaming of EE&C at the LGU level in the 
cities of Cebu, Davao, Batangas, Baguio and Dumaguete. 
4. Market Demand Scoping
The DOE’s energy database system for determining market demand shall be strengthened to 
comply with the provision of the EE&C Act. Energy consumption data/information of energyconsuming sectors that were submitted to the DOE shall be used to establish a sectoral MEP. The 
EE&C Act strengthened the requirement of manufacturers, distributors, importers, and dealers of 
electrical appliances, and other energy consuming products to comply with the Philippine Energy 
Standard and Labeling Program (PESLP). 
To ensure adherence to the PESLP, continuous coordination and cooperation activities were
carried out with private organizations. These organizations include: Energy Practitioners 
Association of the Philippines (ENPAP), Institute of Integrated Electrical Engineers (IIEE) of the 
Philippines, Cement Manufacturers’ Association of the Philippines, Semiconductors and 
Electronics Industries of the Philippines, Inc., Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the 
Philippines, Association of Vehicles Importers and Distributors, Inc., and Certified/Accredited 
Energy Service Companies (ESCOs).
The PESLP shall be implemented by the DOE covering the following household appliances with 
their corresponding MEPs: (1)air-conditioning units with cooling capacity below 3.33 kW and with 
mandatory MEP of 3.08 Cooling Seasonal Performance Factor (CSPF), for units with cooling 
capacity between 3.33 and 9.99 kW, the MEP is 2.81 CSPF; (2) household refrigeratorsranging from 
113 to 600 liters – for Single Door Direct Cooling, the MEP is 200 Energy Efficiency Factor (EEF), for 
Two-Door Direct Cooling, the MEP is 230 EEF, and for Frost-Free units, the MEP is 180 EEF; and (3)
Lighting Products, such as compact fluorescent lamp (CFL), linear fluorescent lamp (LFL), 
fluorescent circular lamp (FCL), ballast and light emitting diode (LED) lamps), which have varying 
MEPs based on a per specification as provided for under the DC 2020-06-0016 (Minimum Energy 
Performance for Products or MEPP). On program expansion, the DOE conducted market 
characterization surveys for electric fans and washing machines.
For the government sector, relevant data on the implementation of GEMP is obtained from the
government entities (NGAs, LGUs, SUCs, GOCCs, and GFI or government financial institutions).
5. Information, Education and Communication (IEC) Campaign on EE&C Practices through EPower Mo
One of government’s crucial responsibilities is to promote energy awareness and disseminate 
useful information on energy efficiency measures and recommended practices for all economic 
sectors. The E-Power Mo is the DOE’s vehicle to empower energy consumers and inform the public 
on available options for a wiser and more intelligent use of energy. It summarizes the 
government’s energy policy agenda on the following:
▪ E-SAFETY – Undertake safety and saving measures through energy efficiency;
▪ E-SECURE – Secure the delivery of quality, reliable and affordable energy services;
143 In 2019, the DOE conducted seminars for the LGUs on the development of their respective LEECPs.▪ E-DISKARTE – Empower consumers through a wide range of options in utilizing 
conventional and alternative energy sources. 
A total of 51 IEC events were conducted nationwide with the theme “Energy Efficiency and 
Conservation.” The IECs were also conducted for E-Power Mo events in Pasay City, Cebu City, Davao 
City, Clark, Pampanga, Baguio City, Tagaytay City and Iloilo City, and Energy 101 for media in 
Tagaytay City and Iloilo City. The DOE was able to educate various sectors of society to make them 
aware of the energy efficiency programs of government with the objective of managing energy 
supply and reducing the country’s dependence on imported fuel sources. 
The DOE, using the EU-assisted project on Access to Sustainable Energy Programme, conducted a 
series of fora on the EE&C Act and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) to promote LGU 
participation in EE&C initiatives, particularly in developing and implementing LEECP, instituting an 
energy management program, strengthening the GEMP, concessional financing packages from 
government financing institutions (GFIs) for EE&C projects and providing incentives through the 
Local Investment Incentives Plan. Likewise, awareness-raising materials were developed in 2019 
to promote the EE&C Act and how it impacts consumers and energy stakeholders. 
B. PLANS AND PROGRAMS
The DOE seeks to reduce inefficient energy consumption in all sectors (including the government) 
in order to achieve a sustainable, secure, sufficient supply of energy and sustain modernization and 
development in the sector.
The Philippine Energy Efficiency and Conservation Roadmap provides the framework outlining the 
drivers and sectoral targets to be undertaken in support of the country’s economic development 
goals through the efficient use of energy. The revised Roadmap for the planning period lines up 
priority initiatives and strategies of the governmentin the medium-to long-term, as shown in Figure
93, to achieve the overall objective of making EE&C a “Way of Life” for the Filipinos. 
Series of E-Power Mo campaignsMedium-Term
1. Energy Efficiency and Resiliency of Electric Cooperatives’ (ECs) Power Line Distribution Systems 
and Facilities
A detailed strategy setting out appropriate mechanisms on energy efficiency and resilience of the 
ECs’ power line distribution systems and facilities shall be formulated. As most interruptions result 
from damages in the distribution system (caused by weather disturbances, accidents or aging 
equipment), power figure system’s reliability and efficiency must be improved through enhanced 
strategies to improve resiliency against any events that can cause long duration outages. A 
baseline study shall be conducted on energy efficiency, reliability and resiliency of the system. The 
resiliency and modernization of distribution systems and facilities are critical in sustaining the use 
and consumption of energy by all economic sectors. 
2. Cross-sectoral Energy Performance and Ratings 
The EE&C Act provides a policy framework on the implementation of PELP. With the approval of 
IRR of the EE&C Act, implementation of the PELP (which used to be under the Department of Trade 
and Industry (DTI) as prescribed in the Consumer Act of 1992 (RA 7394)] will now be transferred to 
the DOE. 
Figure 93. ENERGY EFFICIENCY & CONSERVATION ROADMAP
The DCs for the PELP (DC 2020-06-0015) and the Minimum Energy Performance of Products (DC 2020-06-0016) were 
approved in June 2020, superseding DC 2016-04-0005. The Implementing Guidelines of the said Circulars shall 
undergo public consultation before being finalized.Implementation of the labelling program itself will 
start with the opening of the DOE Online PELP 
Platform by the end of 2020 covering company 
registration, product registration and energy label 
issuance.
The DOE will monitor compliance of the 
manufacturers, importers, dealers and retailers to the 
PELP through market monitoring (label inspection) 
and verification activities by way of testing the actual 
market samples.
Aside from the mandatory energy efficiency and 
labeling system for energy-consuming products, such 
as room air conditioners, refrigeration units, 
television sets and lighting products, the Fuel 
Economy Performance Labeling requirements for 
transport vehicles will also be implemented covering
all manufacturers, importers, distributors and dealers 
of vehicles in the country.
The draft policy on Particular Product Requirements (PPR) is currently for comments of the energy 
stakeholders and the general public. The said PPR will help energy consumers choose wisely in 
buying electric appliances, such as refrigerators, air-conditioning sets, lighting products and 
television sets that are energy-efficient.
3. IEC Campaign on EE&C Policies, Programs and Best Practices
Dissemination of information on energy efficiency policies, programs, best practices and other 
initiatives shall be conducted regularly through the most effective channels like social media, mass 
media and localized events. 
The Roadmap embodies action plans that will be widely communicated so that government 
objectives are made known, as well as enable the private sector partners to recognize their roles 
and contributions towards the coordinated action on energy efficiency. 
4. Integrate and Mainstream EE&C at LGU Level
The integration and mainstreaming of EE&C at the LGU level will be a continuing program within 
the planning horizon as stipulated in the EE&C Act. The LGUs (except barangays), through their 
respective EECOs and Planning Development Offices (PDOs), will have to develop and implement 
LEECPs to be incorporated in the local development plans. 
Related activities include target monitoring and walk-through energy audits of selected LGUs per 
region. Monitoring of lighting, air conditioners and other equipment will also be conducted at the 
LGU level in partnership with DAP.
5. Integrate EE&C in the Learning and Education System
The DOE has strengthened collaboration with the Department of Education (DepEd), Commission 
on Higher Education (CHED) and Technical Education and Skills Development (TESDA) for the inclusion of EE&C in the school curricula. Relatedly, several IEC’s will be designed for educational 
campaigns. Aside from these, other activities include teachers’ training, and stronger linkage with 
the Environmental Education Program of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources
(DENR).
During the 2nd quarter 2020, a draft Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the DOE and 
TESDA on the CECO Training Regulation Development is being circulated for comments. Under 
this MOA, the TESDA (in collaboration with the DOE, CHED and the Department of Science and 
Technology or DOST) shall develop training regulations for certifications of energy managers and 
EE&C officers. This will also ensure promotion of energy efficiency practices through TESDA’s 
technical-vocational education and training programs.
6. Enhanced Demand Side Management Mechanism
Implementation of the Demand Side Management (DSM) Program, specifically for large energy 
consumers, is mandated under the DC 2014-08-0014. This policy enjoins all electricity-consuming 
sectors to implement DSM programs and other conservation measures. In compliance with EE&C 
Act, the DSM will be strengthened and extensively applied over the planning horizon. Lower tariff 
rates could be imposed during off-peak hours, while higher rates will be given during peak hours 
to encourage less power usage during periods of high demand. 
7. Collaboration with Stakeholders for Expanded Financing Models of EE&C Projects
The DOE will facilitate the execution and promotion of successful case studies that demonstrate 
the procurement of energy services and the financial model used especially in the public building 
sector as part of capacity building efforts for ESCOs. Along with this, a template contract on 
government energy efficiency project (GEEP) was also developed.
8. Cross-Sectoral Policy Development (i.e., Building Energy Code)
The development of a more energy-efficient commercial, industrial and transport sectors requires 
the support and participation of relevant stakeholders involved in developing policies that embody
appropriate measures and effective strategies. For instance, sectoral policy development in the 
commercial and industrial sectors is necessary toward the effective transition to a more energyefficient building infrastructure. Inclusion of efficiency measures in the Philippine Green Building
Code can create large-scale impact based on existing Guidelines for Energy Conserving Design of 
Buildings. This involves strong enforcement, collaboration and coordination in the policy making 
process. 
Further, the DOE shall develop a web-based online reporting platform on energy consumption for 
all designated establishments with an annual energy consumption starting from 100,000 kWh and 
above in compliance with their reportorial obligation under the EE&C Act. 
9. Smart Grid by 2040
The DOE looks forward to its long-term vision of transitioning the energy sector into a smart grid 
by 2040. In addition to improving grid reliability, efficiency and resiliency, smart grid technologies 
will empower consumers allowing monitoring and management of energy consumption and 
promotion of new and emerging technologies (such as electric vehicles, net metering, smart 
monitoring equipment and appliances), as well as the development of smart homes and cities
incorporating smart building technologies and home automation systems.In 2015, MERALCO rolled out its Smart Meter Program starting with pre-paid meters within its 
franchise area. This allows customers to monitor their electricity consumption, allowing them to 
budget their consumption and expenses. 
The DOE is conceptualizing a policy on Smart Homes. In line with this, the issuance of a DC on 
Building Energy Code for Low Rise Residential Building is being considered based on the guidelines 
set by the Department. Likewise, another policy is being formulated for buildings with a threshold 
energy consumption of 100,000 kWh per year and above (high-rise condominiums).
10. Create Enabling Mechanisms for Private Sector Participation
As a support for the realization of AmBisyon 2040 and Dutertenomics in the country’s quest to 
realize the “Golden Age of Infrastructure, the DOE recognizes that for a secured energy future, 
government must provide the right environment for investments in energy infrastructures and 
efficient energy technologies. 
Significantly, RA 11234 (the Energy Virtual One-Stop Shop Act) and RA 11032 (the Ease of Doing 
Business and Efficient Government Service and Delivery Act of 2018) were enacted to eradicate 
“red tape” and expedite business transactions in the public sector. EO 30, Creating the Energy 
Investment Coordinating Council and Administrative Order23 (AO 23) titled “Eliminating 
Overregulation to Promote Efficiency of Government Processes” were also issued by the Office of 
the President to accelerate reforms in government processes so as to remove overregulation (i.e. 
redundant or burdensome processes to the public) in the public sector. As stated in AO, timelines 
in the processing of energy projects under the EVOSS Act shall be strictly complied with.
Recognizing the private sector’s role in promoting economic growth, the implementation of the 
foregoing laws and executive issuances will provide a conducive environment for investments, as 
well as create enabling mechanisms for private sector participation. An effective mechanism must 
be in place for private sector participation that would stimulate capital investments. Partnerships 
with the private sector through business organizations like the Association of the Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry will have a pivotal stake in the implementation of key initiatives of the 
government. Fora, where project financings are discussed, could also be another pertinent
platform for dialogues and knowledge sharing for investment opportunities in EE&C related 
projects. 
11. Create the Business Toolkit for ESCOs
The participation of the ESCO industry in the energy efficiency market is vital in accelerating the 
promotion of energy efficient technologies in large energy consuming industries (more than 4 
million KWh per year). To further enhance ESCOs crucial participation in the energy sector’s quest 
for energy efficient industries, a business tool kit shall be created and adopted by the DOE under 
the NEECP. Energy data of ESCOs will be compiled, including assessment of their performance to 
determine the implementation of best practices. The said information is required for submission 
to the DOE every three (3) years prior to their application for renewal of ESCO accreditation. 
12. Cross-sectoral Energy Consumption Monitoring
A comprehensive data collection and management platform must be considered for the effective 
monitoring of activities, as well as to check on whether intended results or objectives are achieved. 
Likewise, an appropriate monitoring and evaluation system will have to be established whereby a data collection system is enhanced through improved indicators and reporting, as well as 
dissemination of performance results to stakeholders. 
13. Energy Efficiency Program in Air and Sea Transport
The energy efficiency and conservation program toward an efficient air and sea transport system 
is an innovative initiative highlighted in the revised Roadmap. 
Under the EE&C Act, the air and marine transport sectors are now required to submit reports to 
the DOE on their specific energy consumption, and other relevant details in order to establish a 
MEP specific to these sectors. The MEP for the transport sector will be introduced in a time-phased 
manner to keep pace with best practices internationally. 
14. Policy Development in the Medium-term
The DOE is working on other pending policies to make EE&C a “game changer” in terms of lowering 
energy demand, increasing energy security and improving the country’s productivity. 
Long-Term
1. Institutionalize a Knowledge Management System
The DOE shall institutionalize knowledge management practices in order to capture, retain, and 
share EE&C related information with all relevant stakeholders as required by RA 11285 and its IRR. 
To sustain this program, the DOE shall develop a repository of knowledge and resource database 
to facilitate retrieval and for sustainability purposes as it shall keep linkages with various economic 
industries, relevant government agencies, academe, non-government organizations, professional 
organizations, research institutions, among others.
2. Develop the Advance Research and Development (R&D) Capacity
The conduct of R&D programs is vital for advancing energy-efficient technologies and practices in 
the country. For this, the DOE will continuously foster collaborative efforts to develop and update 
existing technologies through active participation to international fora and trainings related to 
R&D on EE&C. 
C. INVESTMENT AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES
As the country advances its energy efficiency standards in terms of new technologies and 
infrastructure projects (e.g., net zero buildings), the EE&C programs can support the government’s 
Pending Policies
▪ The DC on the Guidelines in the Administration, Classification and Certification of Energy Service Company (ESCO)
▪ The DC on the Guidelines for the Assessment, Registration and Certification of Energy Conservation Officer, 
Energy Manager and Energy Auditors
▪ IAEECC Resolution No. 2. Adopting the GEMP Guidelines
▪ The DC on the Guidelines for the Endorsement of Energy Efficiency and Conservation Projects to the Board of 
Investments for Fiscal Incentives
▪ The DC on Prescribing the Guidelines of the Philippine Energy Labeling Program (PELP) for Compliance of 
Importers, Manufacturers, Distributors and Dealers of Electrical Appliances and other Energy-Consuming Products 
(ECP) Implementing Guidelineseconomic stimulus programs through the creation of “green jobs and investments” specifically in 
the construction and manufacturing sectors.
Initiatives to promote the efficient use of energy have the potential to bring about socio-economic 
benefits for the country. When investments are channeled to manage energy demand, businesses 
become more competitive, which can then boost local employment. Likewise, production and 
manufacturing of energy efficient equipment and technologies are labor-intensive activities, thus 
creating more jobs for the labor market. 
For the EE&C sector, the generation of investments and employment would focus on firms or 
businesses whose principal activity is the supply of energy efficient goods and services with the 
main goal of generating energy savings. The DOE’s accreditation of ESCOs is one area that 
contributes to such initiative. ESCOs are businesses that deliver energy efficiency upgrades to 
include design, development, and financing of projects that reduce energy consumption, as well 
as operating and maintenance (O&M) costs of their customers’ facilities. In 2018, the DOE 
accredited 26 ESCOs,
144 which brought in an estimated investment of PhP 1.62 billion, as well as 
employment for 390 personnel to implement EE&C projects.
Implementation of EE&C Act during the planning horizon will broaden the window of opportunity 
that generates more investments and employment in the EEC sector. For the commercial, 
industrial and transport sectors, the law provides the need to employ a CECO for Type 1 Designated 
Establishments, CEM for Type 2 Designated Establishments, and Energy Auditors. Both the CECO 
and CEM may either be chosen from within the organization or through external recruitment. 
The CECO Certification System will be developed by the DOE and TESDA, while the certification and 
assessment system of CEM shall be established by DOE and CHED. These certification systems 
shall be conducted by the DOE-accredited training institutions using the training modules 
developed/approved by the DOE and the members of the technical working group (TWG). 
For the national government agencies (NGAs, GOCCs, SUCs), the EE&C Act provides for the 
designation of the EECO for the development and implementation of the agency’s energy 
efficiency and conservation plans and programs (EECP) in accordance with IAEECC directives under 
the GEMP Action Plan. For the LGUs, a Local Energy Efficiency and Conservation Officer (LEECO) 
will be selected from the existing personnel, preferably from the Local Development Office. 
144 In 2019, the DOE posted a total of 34 accredited ESCOs. Figure 94. ENERGY SAVING TIPS
ENERG SAVING TIPS ` 12w3567
The Department of Energy’s (DOE) continuing plans and programs in promoting alternative fuels 
and energy technologies (AFETs) remain as important measures in addressing the increasing 
demand of the transport sector and the high dependency on imported conventional fuels. Greater 
penetration of alternative fuels in the energy mix contributes to energy supply security and to 
reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emission for improved air quality. Providing option for gradual 
replacement of fossil fuels with alternative fuels is one of the key strategies in meeting the 
country’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the Paris Agreement. 
To expand and intensify promotion, the DOE formulated the Alternative Fuels and Energy 
Technologies Roadmap that envisions the successful adoption and commercialization of AFETs. 
This endeavor will be carried out through close coordination and collaborative partnership 
between the government and private sectors in providing the enabling mechanisms and buildingup local capacities.
A. ASSESSMENT
The roadmap provides a detailed outline of the strategic plans and actions required to create a 
country that is both efficient and environment-friendly in terms of energy utilization. 
1. Policy Issuances 
As a policy-making body, the DOE’s primal responsibility lies in the formulation of policies and 
programs to ensure sustainable, secure, sufficient, and accessible energy supply to support the 
country’s overall economic development. 
In the short-term and to harmonize AFET-related policies with inter-agency jurisdiction/concern, 
the DOE:
▪ Drafted a Department Circular (DC) prescribing the Policy Framework for the Development 
of the Fuel Economy Rating, Fuel Economy Performance, and Related Energy Efficiency and 
Conservation Policies for the Transport Sector and Other Support Infrastructures. This is an
energy efficiency and conservation (EE&C)-related policy framework in the transport sector 
including the development and operation of electric vehicles (EVs) and electric vehicle 
charging station (EVCS) infrastructures. The said Circular is anchored on the Energy 
Efficiency and Conservation Act of 2019. 
Chapter VIII. ▪ Signed four (4) Memoranda of Agreement (MOA) and 36 Deeds of Donation with qualified 
local government units (LGUs) and national government agencies (NGAs) in Regions I, II, III 
V, IV-A, IV-B, V, VI, ARMM and the National Capital Region (NCR) regarding the deployment 
of 3,000 electric tricycles (e-trikes) under the Market Transformation through the 
Introduction of Energy Efficient Electric Vehicles Project.
▪ Signed 15 MOAs and Deeds of Donation with the NGAs and offices for the introduction of 
next generation vehicle package (85 units) under the Japan Non-Project Grant Aid (NPGA). 
The vehicle package consisted of for four EVs, four plug-in hybrid EVs (PHEV), 32 hybrid EV 
(HEV) sedans, and 45 HEV patrol cars. The beneficiaries include the Office of the President 
(OP), Department of Finance (DOF), Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), Department of 
Budget and Management (DBM), National Economic Development Authority (NEDA), 
Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), Department of Science and 
Technology (DOST), DOST-Philippine Council for Industry, Energy, and Emerging Technology 
Research and Development (DOST-PCIEERD), Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), 
Department of Tourism (DOT), Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), 
Department of Transportation (DOTr), Philippine National Police (PNP), Philippine 
Information Agency (PIA), Office of Civil Defense (OCD), and PNP Region VIII. 
▪ In support of the EVs program, charging stations were put in the following LGUs and national 
government Agencies/Offices (Table 75).

Group (TWG) under the supervision of the DTI- Technical Committee on Road Transport. 
▪ Issued Department Order (DO) 2019-07-0015 titled “Creation of the Special Financial Audit 
Team for the Alternative Fuels Fund (AFF) under the Natural Gas Vehicle Program for Public 
Transport (NGVPPT)” on 18 July 2019. The DO stipulates that the constituted Audit Team shall 
conduct financial assessment and evaluation of the AFF covered under the following 
aspects: compressed natural gas (CNG) sales volume under the NGVPPT; amount collected 
by Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation (PSPC) for remittance to DOE; and, other financial 
obligation and/or liability of PSPC that may arise under the current government accounting 
and auditing rules and regulations. Along with the issuance of DO, Special Order 2019-07-0045 was also issued designating the DOE officials and employees responsible in carrying 
out the tasks of assessment and evaluation stated under the issued DO and to come up with 
an Audit Report for submission to the Office of the Secretary and the Commission on Audit 
(COA).
2. Legislative Advocacy
The DOE supports various legislations/policies to further boost the promotion and adoption of 
AFETs. Relatedly, the DOE issued two (2) legislative position papers to wit: Inputs on pending bills 
related to alternative fuels vehicles (AFVs) presented at the House of Representatives (HOR) –
Ecology Committee, and inputs/position paper to the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR)
of Excise Tax incentives for AFVs, particularly hybrid and pure EVs, under the Tax Reform for 
Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) Act145.
3. Partnership / Leveraging
As a necessary step towards sustainable, more efficient, and environmentally safe alternative fuels 
and energy technologies, there is a need to access public and private sectors support, attract 
investments and establish partnerships to drive funding, financing, or competitive grants. 
In 2018, the DOE entered into a partnership with the DOST-PCIEERD through a MOA on the conduct 
of research and development (R&D) for the Prototyping of PNS-compliant auto-LPG jeepney; Field 
Demonstration of EV Fast Charging; and Development of Minimum Energy Performance (MEP) 
Protocol for EVCS. A MOA was also signed between the two agencies in 2019 for the “Prototyping 
of Solar-Assisted Plug-in Electric Motor-Powered Boat.” Likewise in 2019, the DOE entered into a 
MOA with the Cavite State University (CvSU) on the conduct of various research and development 
activities for emerging energy technologies. 
4. Prioritization / Promotion
The identified and promoted priority AFET activity in 2018 was the Solar Assisted Plug-in Electric 
Motor-Powered Boat for Tourist and harnessing Human Kinetics from gym and playground for 
electricity generation. The DOE, in partnership with the PIA, also promoted the identified AFETs
through the conduct of 18 information, education and communication (IEC) campaigns and three 
(3) promotional events nationwide.
In 2019, the DOE conducted 22 IECs on the promotion of research, development, demonstration, 
and utilization of AFETs, as well as other promotional activities, specifically in NCR and Regions I, 
III and IV-A. 
5. Technology Demonstration
To gain in-depth understanding of energy efficient technologies, the DOE organized a technology 
demonstration activity for the validation and pilot testing of AFETs with potential for 
commercialization. The conducted technology demonstrations are: a) hybrid vehicles using the 
combination of internal combustion engine (ICE) and electric motors as prime movers; b) plug-in 
hybrid, similar to the hybrid, but utilizing a battery charger that could directly charge from a power 
outlet; and c) pure EV using only electric motors as prime mover and could charge directly from 
power outlet. 
145 Republic Act (RA) 10963 or the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) ActFurther, two technology assessments were completed to wit: the UP-ALAMAT’s vehicle entry to 
the 2018 Shell Eco-Marathon whereby the recommendation for new body frame configuration and 
materials to reduce weight was made; and the Le Guider’s (Philippines) locally converted EV Model 
was developed with the recommendation to improve the transmission gear ratio to match with 
the electric revolution per minute (RPM) and torque. In addition, six (6) alternative fuel 
technologies were also pre-screened for assessment:

1. Review, update and formulate energy-related policies, guidelines, and standards
The DOE will establish concrete measures for the development of required infrastructure through 
a holistic approach to flourish the deployment of alternative fuel vehicles (AFV). The use of clean, 
sustainable, reliable, affordable, and safe energy forms is essential in the mobility of the economy. 
Thus, the promotion of EVs and the establishment of charging stations.
Policy Guidelines and Regulatory Framework for EVCS. Policy guidelines and regulatory framework 
will be developed for the establishment of required infrastructures (e.g. EVCS) and to support 
related laws in the mainstreaming of EVs. Through these guidelines, the DOE will be able to provide 
alternative energy that would power not only homes and industries but also sustain the electric 
vehicles industry in the future. 
Minimum Energy Performance for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations. As required by law, all 
manufacturers, importers, distributors and retailers of energy consuming products (e.g. household 
appliances, lighting products, vehicles, etc.) shall comply with the MEP and the Philippine Energy 
Labelling Program (PELP) guidelines set by the DOE. The MEP is set for specific energy consuming 
products to include EVs and EVCS to be developed by DOE in consultation with relevant 
stakeholders involved in the manufacturing, sale and use of the products covered.
2. Scale-up the use of AFET
Government Vehicle Re-Fleeting Using Next Generation Vehicles. Motor vehicles are indispensable 
for the efficient and effective performance and delivery of essential government services. Several 
policies support the purchase and modernization of government vehicles, such as Administrative 
Figure 95. ALTERNATIVE FUELS & ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES ROADMAPOrder (AO) 14146, and Republic Act (RA) 11285 or the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act of 2019 
(EE&C Act)147. Anchored on the provision of Section 36, the DOE is working on the issuance of rules 
and regulations governing the re-fleeting of government agencies towards the use of AFVs, which
specifically provide the guidelines on the procurement of AFVs for government offices. The AO 14 
allows all government offices to procure in the most efficient and economic manner, motor 
vehicles that are cost effective, fuel-efficient and environment friendly. 
Further, the EE&C Act highlights the government-wide program called the “Government Energy 
Management Program (GEMP),” which mandates all government agencies to reduce their monthly 
consumption of electricity and petroleum products through efficient use of electricity efficiency 
and conservation of fuels for government vehicles, among others. Under this program, the DOE is 
looking for a more economical and cost-effective approach towards fleet acquisition of 
vehicles/shuttles and the savings generated from GEMP can be used to purchase vehicles with 
preference for AFVs. This is responsive to the preference for AFVs of all government offices, such 
as biofuels, natural-gas, solar and electric power. 
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the DOE and Star Scientific Limited in relation to 
the development of the Philippines’ transition to a hydrogen economy. With more than half of the 
current power generation in the country sourced from coal with a strong reliance on the imports, 
the DOE plans to explore the use of hydrogen as a fuel for power generation, and its significant 
contribution to the domestic economy as a whole. Through this MOU, assessment of potential 
hydrogen production in the country will be undertaken to improve energy self-sufficiency level and 
contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions. 
Development of Solar-powered Motorized Boat. A unique way to revolutionize sea transport is the 
development of solar-assisted motorized boat. The DOE entered into a MOA with the DOSTPCIEERD on the prototyping of the solar-assisted electric boat. To motorize our bangka, the 
project will study the sourcing of its power directly from the sun with the use of solar photovoltaic 
(PV) panels and storage batteries. The solar PV provides for a clean, sustainable, and environmentfriendly mode of water transport. 
3. Pursue the use of sustainable energy efficient technologies
Greater partnership with relevant stakeholders and recognizing the fundamental role of the 
private sector in pursuing the use of these energy efficient vehicle technologies is crucial in 
effectively implementing this government initiative. 
Prototyping of OEM Auto-LPG Jeepney - Compliant to the PNS for Public Utility Vehicles (PUVs). In 
view of the escalating prices of petroleum products, the promotion of auto-LPG is being pursued 
as a viable option for transport fuel. Although it is a petroleum-based fuel, the price is much 
cheaper and stable as it is not considered as conventional fuel like gasoline and diesel. The 
promotion is aligned with the concept of providing continuous supply of fuels to the public, as well 
as lessening the impact of oil price fluctuations. Auto-LPG is clean and environment-friendly as it 
has lower GHG/toxic emissions compared with conventional fuels. However, safety and health 
concerns regarding its use need to be addressed. To discount health speculation on its use, the 
DOE conceptualized the prototyping of Original Engine Manufacturer (OEM) for auto-LPG 
jeepneys, which should be compliant with the PNS for PUVs in support of the PUV Modernization 
146 AO 14, s. 2018 provides for the Consolidation and Rationalization of the Rules on the Acquisition of Government Motor Vehicles, Adopting a Centralized 
System of Procurement Therefor, and for Other Purposes. 
147 Under the GEMP’s IRR, the use of alternative fuels in government vehicles is encouraged, among others, to help achieve at least 10.0 percent reduction 
in transport fuel consumptionProgram of the DOTr. The DOE will showcase the OEM auto-LPG jeepney to demonstrate the safe 
use and viability of auto-LPG as an alternative fuel for the public transport sector.
Field Demonstration of EV Fast Charger. Another continuing project is the Field Demonstration of 
EV Fast Charger. The DOE entered into a MOA with the DOST-Science and Technology on Energy 
Application (STEA) for showcasing and demonstrating technologies that could energize electric 
vehicles faster than the usual charging methods. As charging infrastructure is vital to the growth 
of EVs, the DOE, together with its partner institutions, shall continue to build capacities on fast 
charging options as a support for EV industry mainstreaming in the transportation and energy 
industries. 
LPG as fuel for farm equipment. With the objective to expand the utilization of LPG as fuel source, 
the DOE in partnership with Isabela State University, has converted farm equipment engine to use 
LPG to lessen the carbon footprints in the agricultural sector, which is identified as one of the 
sectors that emit extensive amount of GHG. This will help in the agricultural operations and 
innovation of farm equipment for efficient and faster way of harvesting and processing agricultural 
products for countryside development. 
Energy Innovation Challenge. To further develop AFETs, the energy sector will be more responsive 
to market conditions and current demand, with the goal of resorting towards more efficient 
technology evolution and innovation. This program is intended to ignite interest among 
stakeholders to create, design or conceptualize technological innovations on AFETs. 
4. Collaboration with Stakeholders
The role of stakeholders in all phases of technology development from conceptualization and
design, up to the implementation stage is critical. Their involvement, be it financial, technical or 
advisory, is significant to the success of energy technology program implementation. To ensure 
the development and exploitation of new energy technologies, the DOE is collaborating with 
relevant stakeholders on the following programs: 
Prototyping of Human Kinetic Energy Harvesting 
Equipment. This program tends to use ambient 
energy to provide electricity for small and mobile 
equipment sourced or generated from human 
motion. Energy harvesting is now a development 
in power sourcing as it is always available, 
requiring no fuel or any logistical processes. For 
this, the DOE is collaborating with concerned 
government agencies and academic institutions 
in securing consultancy services for the full 
development of this project. 
Performance Testing of EV/HEV. In compliance 
with the PELP and the MEP requirement as 
mandated by the EE&C Act, the DOE will continue to conduct performance testing of EVs in 
collaboration with DOST, UP-Diliman and the Cagayan State University. Performance testing is 
necessary to gather benchmark data for EV technology modeling and EV development programs, 
including the development of the required MEP. 
Electricity from Human KineticsDevelopment of Training Module for 
EV/HEV Technician. To help sustain the EV 
industry, the development of effective 
training modules for EV/HEV technicians
is highly significant. This module will help 
produce well-trained technicians to have 
the necessary skills to repair electric 
vehicles safely from basic maintenance to 
full diagnostic and repair. 
Development of Emergency Response 
Protocol. To ensure safety use of efficient 
AFVs (e.g. EV, HEV, PHEV, etc.), the 
development of emergency response 
protocol is needed. Together with the 
Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP), the 
response protocol will be adopted by the 
regional BFP sub-units to respond on the 
issues and concerns related to the AFVs,
while maintaining its safety and reliability 
as alternative mode of transport.
Long-Term
1. Alternative Fuel Vehicle mainstreamed in the transport sector 
To achieve the objective of mainstreaming of AFVs in the transport sector, the DOE will continue 
working on the following initiatives:
Deploy applicable AFETs for transport and non-transport purposes. As a long–term strategy, the 
DOE seeks to deploy applicable AFETs for transport to further decarbonize the sector and reduce 
dependence on oil. For non-transport purposes, the DOE shall also continue to identify and 
promote AFETs through collaborative efforts with relevant stakeholders for the effective 
mainstreaming of AFETs in the market. 
Strong collaboration with stakeholders – government agencies, private sector, LGUs, investors, 
funders, entrepreneurs, transport groups and academe – shall be intensified to achieve greater 
adoption and commercialization of AFETs with full government support. 
2. Continuing Government Initiatives
Assessment of emerging AFET. Assessment of emerging energy technologies shall be undertaken 
regularly. The government shall then continue to encourage and provide support and cooperation 
to the private sector for investment generation across to maximize the benefits of alternative 
fuels, and advanced and emerging energy technologies. 
Conduct of relevant policy studies on emerging AFET. To advocate and promote the use of AFETs, 
the DOE will strengthen research activities for its local adoption. This will come in the form of 
building up local capability for R&D and partnership with the DOST, state universities, and other 
research institutions. 
DOE Team inspecting the Toyota Prius Hybrid Electric Vehicle
Performance testing of E-trike in Cagayan ValleyConduct of IEC on the benefits of AFET to engage the stakeholders. The DOE shall continue to 
conduct IECs to create greater awareness and appreciation of the importance of cleaner AFETs, 
and efficient utilization of energy. By mainstreaming and encouraging the public to resort to AFET, 
it creates a long-term benefit to the people and the environment. 
3. Priority Alternative Fuels and Energy Technologies
Following are various AFETs that will be promoted 
within the planning horizon:
Electric vehicles. The EVs shall be continuously 
promoted by encouraging investments especially in 
after sales services such as charging stations, parts and 
supply service centers, among others, to make it more 
commercially competitive and be integrated in the 
transportation network.
In particular, the HEV utilizes an electric motor and an 
internal combustion engine that work together or 
separately to propel the vehicle, while simultaneously 
charging the battery. It is a reliable and efficient 
transportation that supports the objective of the 
government for a more efficient, cleaner, and 
sustainable mobility. Although there are some 
challenges in the infrastructure to support its 
development, the DOE continues to encourage
investments from the private sector to advance 
expansion of the HEV industry.
Auto-LPG. This supports the use of LPG as a clean 
alternative fuel for transportation and other 
equipment. The DOE shall continue to validate 
performance of LPG as a fuel for vehicles and formulate 
standards and policies to ensure public safety and 
welfare of the public. Likewise, research and studies 
for other application of LPG shall be undertaken. 
Compressed Natural Gas. The commercial viability of 
CNG shall be demonstrated, as well as its technical 
requirements, market demand, and impact of incentives and 
public acceptance to the public transport sector. Policies and various fiscal and non-fiscal 
incentives shall be formulated and provided to cover the standards regarding the vehicle, refueling 
station, gas cylinder, and gas quality to support the implementation of the program. 
4. Assessment of non-transport energy technologies will be pursued
Evaluation, testing and validation of emerging energy technologies for domestic application, 
specifically in the transport sector shall be given utmost attention. Also, the evaluation and 
validation of the following non-transport energy technologies will be conducted:
▪ Smart control and sensors at home for energy savings;
Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV)▪ Grass-based biomass fuel (Bugang/Napier) for domestic cooking to address deforestation 
and reduce indoor pollution; and
▪ Alternative fuel derived from waste rubber and plastics.
5. Infrastructure Support
The government institution partners – DOE, DOTr, DTI, DOST, DENR and Department of Public Works 
and Highways (DPWH) and other relevant agencies – are underway in the establishment of 
infrastructure support for the EV transport through close coordination and collaboration. 
Lawmakers have proposed bills to come up with policies,regulatory framework and incentives that
will help sustain the development of the EV industry. The infrastructure measures will focus on
following: a) development of dedicated parking lots with installed charging stations in every public 
and private establishments; b) installation of public charging stations at gasoline stations, public 
buildings and establishments; and c) provision of green routes or alternate lanes where EVs and 
other alternative transport such as bicycles, e-bikes, e-scooters will exclusively pass through. 
There are now several opened bicycle lanes in Metro Manila cities where bicycles and e-scooters 
traverse. Plans and programs are in progress in the provision of bicycle lanes in existing and future 
road plans of the DPWH. The LGUs will be mandated to create or identify the feasible green routes 
in their local public transport plan. When realized, this alternative mobility option will be 
convenient to the growing number of local residents who consider shifting their transport mode 
to bicycles, e-bikes and e-scooters in going around town/city or travelling between home and work.
C. INVESTMENT AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES
Electric Vehicle Industry
The EV market in the Philippines is segmented into e-tricycles/e-trikes, e-bikes/ 
motorcycles/scooters, e-jeepneys, e-quads, passenger EVs, and service vehicles. The market is 
projected to significantly grow over the next decade owing to the country’s economic growth.
As a result of the intensive promotional activities and implementation of the DOE on the Market 
Transformation through Introduction of Energy Efficient Electric Vehicles (E-Trike) Project
together with the vehicle manufacturing industry incentives of the DTI, the PUV modernization 
of the DOTr and the efforts of the LGUs to clean up air in their locality, the Project was able to 
catalyze the market by attracting 14 investors. These were formed from 2013 to 2019 and 
engaged in the business of electric vehicle manufacturing, assemblers and importers with a 
corresponding investment of PhP 562 Million (USD 11.3 Million148) and generated about 1,050 
direct jobs supporting the creation of the electric vehicle industry in the country (Table 76). 
With full coordination and support from the government and stakeholders on the EV industry 
initiatives, additional EVs are being envisioned by the Electric Vehicles Association of the 
Philippines (EVAP) to be on the road by year 2021 covering all types of EVs such as e-trikes, ejeeps, e-shuttles, e-buses and e-cars for both public and private transportation as illustrated in 
Table 77.
148 USD = PhP 50
0To achieve sustainable development of the industry, the DTI implements Executive Order No. 
226 or the “Omnibus Investments Code of 1987” which provides Income Tax Holiday of six years 
to a maximum of eight years for new registered pioneering firms that will engage in the business 
of EVs, Alternative Fuels Vehicles, charging stations and environment/climate change-related 
projects, as well as Duty Free importation of capital equipment, spare parts and supplies.
Executive Order 488 (s. 2006) was also issued modifying the rates of import duty on 
components, parts and accessories for the assembly of hybrid, electric, flexible fuel and CNG 
motor vehicles to zero rate, thereby allowing EV manufacturers to import components at a 
more affordable cost.
The Department of Finance (DOF) through the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) implements 
TRAIN Act, which provides excise tax incentives as follows: 
▪ Pure EV will be fully exempt from the excise tax on automobiles; and,
▪ Hybrid Vehicles will be taxed 50.0 percent of the applicable excise tax rates on 
automobiles.

 **** Market projection for 2020-2021 is seen to be greatly affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and recovery in the EV market sales may come in 
 the second semester of 2021Also, the proposed Senate Bill No. 1382 and House Bill 4075 will provide the national energy 
policy and regulatory framework for the use of EVs and the establishment of charging stations.
This applies to the manufacture, importation, installation, utilization, and regulation of EVs, 
charging station, parts and components, and batteries. When enacted, this will provide a clear 
direction and related incentives to boost the EV industry.Energy production and consumption produce greenhouse gas emission (GHG). These should be
continuously balanced with sustainable the development of a growing economy. As such, the 
energy sector takes into account a sound environmental management as an integral part of the 
sector’s strategic directions, specifically on strengthening consumer protection and promoting a 
low carbon future to achieve a sustainable development. 
In support of President Duterte’s “Build, Build, Build Program,” sufficient energy supply must be 
ensured to meet the growing energy demand of the economy and achieve the government’s 
economic goals. However, economic growth and rising energy requirement could result in greater 
environmental impacts if not managed conscientiously. Such environmental impacts can be 
reduced to moderate levels through stakeholders’ commitments to environmental protection. 
The following are the best practices on environmental management in the country’s energy sector: 
▪ Integration of environmental issues into business decisions through the use of 
management systems;
▪ Integration of health, safety and environmental management systems;
▪ Consideration of all environmental components (air, water, land, people and biodiversity) 
in decision making at strategic and operational levels;
▪ Implementation of appropriate pollution prevention techniques, including the re-use 
and/or recycling of waste components;
▪ Evaluation of alternatives on a cost, benefit and risk bases that include environmental 
values;
▪ Minimization of resource inputs through efficiency measures; and, 
▪ Innovation and improvement on environmental protection.
A. ASSESSMENT
1. The Philippines Environmental Impact Statement System and Environmental Impact Assessment 
Reports of Energy Projects 
The Philippines Environmental Impact Statement System (PEISS), established in 1979 through 
Presidential Decree (PD) 1586, requires project proponents to prepare and submit an 
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) that describes the potential effects of a project on 
environment and the corresponding mitigating measures. It serves as a planning tool for 
incorporating environmental management measures in project design, as well as a means for 
 compliance with environment laws, such as: the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Solid Waste 
Management Act, and Toxic Substances and Hazardous Waste Management Act.
Under Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Administrative Oder (AO) 03-
30149 issued in August 2007, the PEISS categorizes projects or undertakings, including major 
expansion, rehabilitation and/or modification of existing projects, and resumption of projects that 
ceased operations for a long period based on the following: 
▪ Category A projects or undertakings classified as Environmentally Critical Projects (ECPs), as 
they pose high risks or negative environmental impacts (e.g. energy facilities and 
infrastructure projects, power plants);
▪ Category B projects or undertakings classified as ECP under Category A, and significantly 
affect the quality of environment due to their location in an Environmentally Critical Area 
(ECA) – an ecologically, socially, or geologically sensitive area (e.g. renewable energy 
projects); 
▪ Category C projects or undertakings, not classified under Category A or B, that intend to 
directly enhance the quality of environment or directly address existing environmental 
problems; and,
▪ Category D projects or undertakings that are deemed unlikely to cause significant adverse 
impact on the quality of environment. These projects are not covered by PEISS.
Categories A and B are required to secure an Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC), which 
contains specific measures and conditions that must be met by the project proponent before and 
during operation of the project. All ECC applications should be accompanied by an Environmental 
Impact Assessment (EIA) Report in the form of an EIS, an Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) 
Checklist Report, an Environmental Performance Report and Management Plan (EPRMP), 
Programmatic EIS or Programmatic EPRMP. On the other hand, Categories C and D only need to 
obtain a Certificate of Non-Coverage (CNC) stating that the proposed project is not covered by the 
PEISS.
For the past 30 years of PEISS implementation, the DOE is actively participating in the continuous 
enhancement and/or improvement, specifically on the procedures and requirements in the 
conduct and review of EIA Studies and in the Environmental Compliance Monitoring and Validation 
Reporting. In the review and evaluation of the ECC application, the DENR-Energy Management 
Bureau (EMB) commissions experts who will form part of the EIA Review Committee, while the 
DOE expert serves as a resource person. 
In 2018, ECC was issued to 28 coal-fired power plants, 23 oil-based power plants, eight (8) natural 
gas-fired power plants, nine (9) geothermal power plants, 29 hydro plants, 13 biomass power 
plants, six (6) wind power, 18 solar, two (2) petroleum refineries, and one (1) gas processing plant. 
2. Environmental Compliance and Monitoring
The DOE regularly conducts environmental compliance monitoring of energy projects and facilities 
to ensure that social and environmental safeguards are effectively applied. This is done through 
the Multi-partite Monitoring Team (MMT), a required mechanism under the PEISS. Under DENR 
149 This refers to DENR Administrative Order on the Revised Procedural Manual and Guidelines of PEISS under the PD 1586AO 2017-15, only Category A or environmentally critical projects are required to organize its MMT 
after its ECC is awarded, thus not all energy projects have MMTs. 
The MMT aims to encourage public and/or stakeholders’ participation and provide appropriate 
check and balance mechanisms in monitoring the development and implementation of projects. 
It is composed of representatives from the relevant government agencies, local government units 
(LGUs), non-government organizations (NGOs), and peoples’ organizations (POs), the community, 
the women’s sector, and whenever necessary, from the academe and other sectors. For some 
projects, the DOE has been nominated to solely lead or co-lead the MMTs.
The MMT activity is guided by the following objectives: 
▪ Ensure compliance of project proponent with standards as stipulated in the Environmental 
Management Plan, Environmental Monitoring Plan, Social Development Plan, as well as other 
ECC conditions, and related permits;
▪ Share knowledge, experiences and provide recommendations to improve monitoring 
procedures; 
▪ Assist in harmonizing the relationship of all stakeholders to ensure public and social 
acceptability of energy projects; 
▪ Prepare, integrate and disseminate monitoring reports and submit recommendations to the 
DENR; and, 
▪ Monitor Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities.
The MMT is operationalized through the formulation of an annual monitoring plan that covers air 
and water quality, biophysical and socioeconomic monitoring activities. The DOE, as member of 
the MMT, participates in the environmental compliance monitoring and verification of various 
energy projects and facilities.
Table 78 shows the number of energy projects/facilities that have Environmental Management Plan
(EMP), Environmental Monitoring Fund (EMF), Environmental Guarantee Fund (EGF), and the
Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan (EMMOPs). The EMPs and EMMOPs cover four
(4) segments – air quality, water quality, biodiversity and waste management, and people. 
Implementation of efficiency and conservation program is likewise incorporated in the EMPs and
EMMOPs.

activities of the project, while EGF is the fund to cover potential public risk of the projects or 
undertakings, such as damage to life, health, property, and the environment requiring 
rehabilitation or restoration measures. 
The DOE shall encourage energy projects that are not ECPs or those that do not have MMTs to take 
the initiative to establish multi-sectoral/multi-stakeholder activities to monitor their compliance to 
ECC conditions and permits. This is to promote a more transparent engagement of the energy 
sector to host communities. Likewise, it helps future energy projects to be supported and 
accepted by the stakeholders.
Energy projects and facilities are committed to integrate health, safety and environment 
management system (HSEMS) in their operations. These projects/facilities must also adopt 
existence international standards, such as the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9000 for 
quality management and the ISO 14000 for environmental management. 
3. Pollution Control Technologies 
The energy sector has been proactive in evaluating and introducing new engineering and 
operational techniques to prevent and reduce pollution. To prevent waste at its source, the energy 
facilities are equipped with the following pollution control systems and technologies, namely:
▪ Electrostatic precipitators and bag filters for particulate matter emissions (PM);
▪ Flue gas desulfurizer for sulfur oxides (SOx) emissions;
▪ Low Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) Burners/Dry Low NOx combustion technology/selective 
catalytic reduction technology for particulates NOx emissions; 
▪ Waste water treatment facility, oil-water-gas separator, skimming/gas flotation, static 
hydrocyclones, mechanical centrifugation, gas stripping for treating wastewater; and, 
▪ Ash disposal system, sedimentation basin, hazardous waste storage and disposal 
facility, materials recovery facility for reducing and removing solid wastes.
4. Addressing Climate Change 
The energy sector is an important component of the National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP)
under its Sustainable Energy Program Framework. The Framework identified both mitigation 
actions and adaptation measures to address climate change. With the country’s positive economic 
outlook, the energy sector is mindful of the need to institutionalize policy and program 
mechanisms, and interventions to mitigate the effects of climate change and global warming. 
The energy sector’s component of the NCCAP is harmonized with the targets and timelines of the 
Philippine Energy Plan (PEP) in pushing for renewable energy (RE), alternative fuels and energy 
efficiency measures. These are considered as strategic elements of greening economic growth 
toward a sustainable low carbon future. Mainstreaming of RE increases the share of clean energy 
sources in the country’s on-grid electricity supply. Moreover, the decentralized renewable system 
is crucial in addressing the energy demand and supply requirements of the communities in off-grid 
and isolated areas. 
The attainment ofthe National Renewable Energy Program (NREP) target of additional 15,000 MW
by 2030 of generating capacity from renewables is supported by the RE technology roadmap. To 
complement this, the renewable energy research and development agenda will be pursued in collaboration with the state university-based Affiliated Renewable Energy Centers (ARECs) of the 
DOE, as well as the engagement with the science and technology community. 
The nationwide implementation of the NEECP will be accelerated as it seeks to reduce fuel and 
electricity consumption of all the economic sectors of society: industrial, transport, commercial, 
residential, and agriculture. The passage of the Energy Efficiency and Conservation (EE&C) Act is 
seen to intensify the use of energy efficient technologies, including substantive values reorientation campaign on the benefits of energy efficiency and conservation. To sustain and scale 
up promotional efforts, the NCCAP considers the tripartite partnership network among the 
government, private sector and civil society as a major strategy. 
Under the sustainable energy component of the NCCAP, the energy sector is expected to 
contribute to the attainment of an environmentally sustainable transport system. Among the 
sector’s programs to support this goal include: (1) use of alternative transport fuels sourced from 
compressed natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, biofuels (CME and E10) and electricity; (2) 
conduct of research and studies on higher biofuel blends; and, (3) undertake a feasibility study on 
hybrid systems, such as fuel cells, among others. Likewise, energy efficiency standards and labeling 
for new vehicles will be implemented. 
B. PLANS AND PROGRAMS
The energy sector is also facing the challenges brought about by climate change, thus, mitigation 
measures and adaptation strategies also need to be implemented by the sector. It should be 
emphasized that mitigation actions are being implemented as a function of adaptation strategies. 
These actions are primarily being implemented to address and achieve energy security, reliability, 
resiliency and environmental sustainability while at the same time reducing and/or avoiding the 
greenhouse gas emissions. This is also the approach being adopted for the development of the 
energy sector’s share to the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) of the country.
1. Climate Change Mitigation
To successfully implement the mitigation measures to reduce the energy sector’s GHG emissions, 
several issues and concerns have to be addressed such as: (1) development barriers on renewable 
energy (i.e., high capital cost, cost of transmission access, and off-take risks), which constrain 
commercial bank financing; (2) financing barriers on the implementation of energy efficiency 
programs/projects partly due to the invisibility of measures and difficulty in demonstrating and 
quantifying results; and (3) accounting and reporting actual emission level and emission reduction
from contributing energy-consuming sectors. 
Amid these challenges, the DOE will carry out the following within the planning horizon: 
▪ Integration of climate change mitigation measures in energy policies, plans and strategies 
including laws and regulations;
▪ Development of guidelines on accounting and reporting of GHG emissions and emission 
reduction to cover capacity building for the establishment of reporting forms and database;
▪ Implementation of emission reduction programs and projects;
▪ Dissemination of knowledge, research and best practices on mitigation;
▪ Development and adoption of sustainable financing mechanisms; and,
▪ Monitoring, reporting and evaluation systems of mitigation policies and measures.
These actions are vital to achieve the initiatives outlined in the energy sector’s NDC with the target 
GHG emission avoidance and/or reduction of 480.2 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e) in total primary energy supply (TPES) in the Clean Energy Scenario (CES), which is about 11.3 
percent lower than the Reference/Business-as-Usual (BAU) Scenario from 2020 to 2040 (Please see 
Figures 36 and 37 in Chapter II). The transport sector is excluded from the total GHG emissions 
which the Department of Transportation (DOTr) shall lead per EO 174, “Institutionalizing the 
Philippine Greenhouse Gas Inventory Management and Reporting System.”
Over the planning horizon, GHG emissions from coal and oil decrease by 14.0 percent to 15.0 
percent (in TPES) with increased utilization of renewable energy, improved efficiency of fossilbased technology and increased use of natural gas specifically for power generation. 
2. Climate Change Adaptation
In recent years, the Philippines experienced a series of devastating natural disasters like extreme 
weather events and natural calamities that affected energy infrastructure and facilities. From 
these catastrophic events, the energy sector has been identified as among the most vulnerable 
sectors to climate change, and thus needs to develop suitable coping mechanisms and 
interventions focusing on energy supply security, particularly in off-grid areas. These areas are so 
remote that connection to the main grid is not an immediate option. Electricity in these areas is 
mainly sourced from diesel generators putting the supply at risk in times of energy disruptions. In 
view of environmental considerations and technology innovations, the use of renewables (i.e. such 
as solar, wind and hydro) provides alternative off-grid solutions.
 
However, adaptation measures are not only for high risk areas most affected by climate change 
since the whole energy system faces an equally daunting challenge on how to climate-proof the 
country’s energy facilities. Improving the resiliency of energy facilities is a critical adaptation 
measure for energy infrastructures as it will help them endure the adverse impact of the changing 
patterns of climatic conditions. 
Guided by previous adaptation actions, it is important that the planning process of energy 
projects/facilities embrace the principles of sustainable energy, disaster responsive power systems 
and environmental protection through the establishment of energy resilient infrastructures. The 
social and economic impacts of climate change-related consequences, such as energy supply 
disruptions/outages as results of extreme climatic events (e.g. typhoons, floods, landslides), also 
redounds to adverse economic losses for the country. As such, the long-term goal is to 
mainstream adaptation in energy development projects by climate proofing energy infrastructures 
and systems to withstand extreme weather events. Thus, the programs and activities to be 
identified in the Energy Resiliency Road Map and the formulation of the Energy Resiliency 
Standards are also vital to the climate change adaptation strategies of the energy sector. 
To pursue climate change adaptation strategies in the energy sector, the following gaps and issues 
should be properly addressed: (1) assessment of energy infrastructures and systems’ vulnerability, 
including pressures on energy demand and supply; and (2) development of models on climate 
change impacts of weather extremes, seasonal variability, changes in temperature and wind 
speeds to assess implications on energy supply resources (e.g. wind, solar and hydro), and on 
energy consumption patterns. 
In view of the above, the climate change adaptation action plan will be implemented within the 
planning horizon: 
▪ Conduct of impact and vulnerability assessments of the energy systems and infrastructures 
(i.e. power generation, transmission and distribution, fuel production and transport);▪ Institutionalize the Energy Resiliency Policy and other measures such as: (1) integration of 
structural adaptations into the structural design/strengthening of energy infrastructures and, 
(2) implementation of infrastructure reinforcement measures on:
o power transmission and distribution systems, underground cabling for power 
distribution system;
o fuel distribution systems, underground fuel pipeline distribution system;
o infrastructure intervention e.g. sea walls/coastal defense; and,
o soil erosion control system.
▪ Mainstream climate change adaptation in energy policies, plans and programs including laws 
and regulations;
▪ Develop strategies on changing demand patterns focusing on:
o Investments in technological change to address energy demand and supply options; 
o Establishment of sustainable financing mechanisms; and,
• Share and disseminate knowledge, research and best practices on adaptation.
To present a balanced energy sector approach, these adaptation strategies as well as the required 
estimated financial requirements to implement such responses will also be incorporated in the 
energy sector’s NDC.
3. National Framework Strategy on Climate Change 
The National Framework Strategy on Climate Change (NFSCC) serves as the foundation in 
addressing climate change, and identifies adaptation as the anchor strategy, while mitigation as a 
function of adaptation.

of climate science, e.g. GHG inventory); and (3) water sufficiency strategies focusing on water 
governance restructured toward a climate and gender responsive water sector (Table 79). 
4. Development of the National GHG Inventory Management and Reporting System 
As stipulated under EO 174, the DOE leads the GHG inventory of the energy sector. Specifically, the 
DOE is tasked to conduct, document, archive and monitor GHG inventory (accounting and 
reporting of GHG emissions from combustion of fossil fuels in stationary sources, mobile sources 
(though this will be accounted by the DOTr as the lead agency for transport sector’s GHG 
inventory), and fugitive emissions. The inventory enables the government to define ways of 
reducing emissions and adopt low carbon pathways to support the NDC. 
In 2018, the DOE submitted the 2010 GHG Emission Inventory Report of the Energy Sector to the 
Climate Change Commission. It was subjected to quality assurance (QA) by experts from the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and was subsequently enhanced and 
integrated in the National GHG Inventory Report. The said report is the basis of the NDC and will 
also be incorporated in the Third National Communication (TNC).
The DOE, as a member of the Climate Change Database Keepers Committee, supports the 
development of the National Integrated Climate Change Database and Information Exchange 
System (NICCDIES) within the planning horizon. The NICCDIES is an integrated, comprehensive, 
and highly accessible national database with an information exchange facility to cater to climate 
change data clients or end-users.
5. United Nations FrameNations work Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement(PA)
The UNFCCC was adopted in 1992 as an international political response to climate change, which 
sets out a framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of GHG to avoid 
“dangerous anthropogenic interference” with the climate system. Meanwhile, the Kyoto Protocol 
adopted in 1997, commits industrialized countries and countries in transition to a market economy 
to achieve GHG emission reduction targets by an average of 5.2 percent (below the 1990 levels).
In 2015, Conference of Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC adopted the PA as a new legally-binding 
framework for an internationally coordinated effort to tackle climate change. It recognizes the 
different responsibilities and actions that each Party can take to achieve the goal of limiting the 
increase of global temperature to below 2.0 degrees Celsius (°C).
The COP also adopted a decision that guides pre-2020 action and sets out implementation details 
for the PA before its entry into force, which contain the detail and guidance on how to develop 
and formulate NDCs.
The decision calls for enhanced action on mitigation including the second commitment period to 
Kyoto Protocol, mitigation pledge, technical examination process and cooperation with noncountry stakeholders. The technical examination focusing on lessons sharing and cooperative 
actions were identified for adaptation, while developed countries were urged to scale up the level 
of financial support.6. Energy Sector NDC
As envisioned in Ambisyon 2040, the Philippine economy shall grow and expand, thus the energy 
sector will need to fuel and sustain country’s progress and development, while at the same time 
address GHG emissions. This will be achieved through policies, programs and projects focusing on 
renewable energy development and utilization, biofuels program, natural gas projects, energy 
efficiency and conservation programs and the use of highly efficient and emerging technology for
power generation.
The energy sector has transformed over the years as reflected in the country’s energy mix. Total 
energy consumption has moved alongside economic development and population growth, which 
resulted in increased levels of GHG released into the atmosphere. The GHG emissions from the 
energy sector is mainly from the combustion of fossil fuels and other activities related to the 
production of energy. This NDC includes all the GHG-emitting sectors with 2010 as the base year 
for the GHG emission and projections until 2040. It is consistent with the Philippine Development 
Plan (PDP), NFSC, NCCAP and the PEP, which utilizes the gross domestic product (GDP) growth 
rates provided by the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) and the population 
growth rates from the Philippines Statistics Authority (PSA). 
The DOE started its efforts on GHG inventory for the Initial National Communication (INC) with the 
1994 GHG inventory, and was followed by the 2000 GHG Inventory for the Second National 
Communication (SNC) as part of the country’s commitment to the UNFCCC. From then on, the 
energy sector has come up with annual GHG inventory using the 1996 IPCC Guidelines. For the base 
year GHG emission of the NDC (2010 GHG inventory), the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and software were
used for both Top-Down or Reference Approach, and the Bottom-up or Sectoral Approach. 
Using the Reference Approach, a total of 76.8 
million metric ton CO2e (MTCO2e) was emitted by 
the energy sector, which included the emissions 
from the use of fuels by the transport sector. Liquid 
fuels accounted for 54.5 percent, while solid fuels 
and gaseous fuels contributed 36.2 percent and 9.3 
percent, respectively (Figure 96). Liquid fuels 
include crude oil, motor gasoline, aviation gas, jet 
kerosene, other kerosene, diesel oil, residual fuel oil, 
liquefied petroleum products and other petroleum 
products, while coal and the natural gas from 
Malampaya are those considered in the solid and 
gaseous fuels. 
For the Sectoral Approach or Bottom-Up Approach, Table 80 shows that fuel combustion and 
fugitive emissions from fuels stood at 77.3 MTCO2e. Energy industries accounted for more than 
42.7 percent of the emissions followed by the transport sector at 31.3 percent, manufacturing 
industries and construction at 15.6 percent and other sectors at 10.3 percent. Fugitive emissions 
only accounted for 0.1 percent. The energy sector contributed 68.7 percent of the 2010 inventory 
or about 53.1 MTCO2e of GHG emissions (total emission of 77.3 MTCO2e less 24.2 MTCO2e from the 
transport sector).

Bulk of the energy industries’ emissions came from electricity production equivalent to 96.7 
percent of the total GHG emission. For transport, road use contributed 87.8 percent of the sector’s 
emissions, while the residential utilization of fuel accounted for more than half of the emissions of 
the “other sectors” followed by the commercial/institutional users at 37.2 percent.
With the energy sector’s 201o GHG emissions as the base year and the Energy Demand and Supply 
Outlook in Chapter 2 using the same the key parameters and macroeconomic assumptions of the 
other sectors with NDC targets (transport, industry, waste, forestry, and agriculture), the 
foundations of the energy sector’s NDC have been defined. The energy sector’s NDC utilizes the 
results of the energy demand and supply projections in total final energy consumption (TFEC) and 
TPES excluding the transport sector (with separate sectoral NDC), and the power demand and 
supply outlook.

1.13 2.28 3.43 4.58 5.72 71.96 The Reference Scenario of the PEP serves as the BAU Scenario of the energy sector’s NDC, which 
incorporates existing policies and programs on renewable energy, alternative fuels and energy 
efficiency, as well as the committed and indicative power projects. It also integrates the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation’s (APEC) aspirational target to reduce aggregate energy intensity by 25.0 
percent in 2030 to 45.0 percent by 2035 from the 2005 level. The BAU and CES scenarios cover 
unconditional NDC targets that the government will implement through the energy efficiency 
programs with an estimated reduction of 72.0 MTCO2e over the next 20 years, or equivalent to 3.43 
MTCO2e per year (Table 81).
Sustaining these programs in the BAU Scenario, while improving energy security and enhancing 
the sector’s resilience, are the key drivers of the CES, which targets to maintain at least 35.0 
percent of renewable energy share in the capacity and generation mix. The CES likewise allows 
the entry of highly efficient and emerging technologies, electric vehicles, and use of natural gas in 
other sectors and energy efficiency improvement across all sectors. 
From 2020 to 2040, the GHG emissions from CES reaches 3,751.99 MTCO2e, about 12.29 percent 
lower than BAU with 4,277.59 MTCO2e. The 525.59 MTCO2-e of GHG emissions translates to an 
average of about 9.59 percent avoidance/reduction per year from 2o20-2040. Although increased 
utilization natural gas leads to increasing emission over the planning period, such is offset by the 
emission reduction from decreased coal and oil utilization. Most of the emission reduction comes
from the decreased utilization of coal in the electricity generation. 
Table 82. BUILD COST OF THE SCENARIOS (Billion USD)

As shown Table 82, the required build cost (capital investment) for additional generating capacity 
under the BAU amounts to USD 102.25 billion. A much higher investment is needed for CES with 
an average of USD 5.8 billion per year or a total of USD 121.13 billion for the power generating 
capacity, up by 18.49 percent from BAU. More than 60 percent of the CES investment is allotted 
for the installation of 45,337 MW of new renewable energy capacity from 2020-2040. System cost 
(i.e., reliability, transmission and distribution and storage costs) needs to be factored in to provide 
a more complete investment requirement to achieve the target. The costs of other mitigation 
actions included in energy efficiency and alternative fuels plans and programs also need to be 
studied to determine the total mitigation costs of the NDC. 
The GHG emission avoidance/reduction is aggregated for all mitigation measures to provide 
flexibility in terms of implementation. The energy sector likewise maintains that the NDC targets 
can only be realized if the necessary financing, technology and capacity development are provided 
to the stakeholders together with new and enhanced policies, programs and projects, as well as 
the institutionalization of the necessary enabling environments. Thus, the energy sector’s NDC 
target of 12.29 percent GHG reduction/avoidance in CES is conditional. 
Further, the adaptation strategies discussed in this Chapter will likewise form part of the NDC to 
provide a comprehensive approach to climate change response. These adaptation responses are 
complementary to mitigation actions and thus a priority of the energy sector.The Department of Energy (DOE) puts a premium on a sustainable future through an open 
technology approach for alternative energy sources for the country to provide greater energy 
security, stability, reliability and affordability. The vision for a low carbon future is anchored on a 
technology-neutral policy, to develop a diversified and balanced energy mix. As such, the DOE 
remains steadfast in its position of taking a calculated and scientific approach to tapping nuclear 
energy as a long-term fuel option for power generation given its technical and economic viability.
The DOE adopts the Milestones Approach in the Development of a National Infrastructure for 
Nuclear Power of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to assist countries that are 
considering or planning their first nuclear power plant, and to help the Member States understand 
the commitments and obligations associated with developing a Nuclear Power Program (NPP)150. 
Likewise, the Milestones Approach provides the countries with nuclear power plants an 
opportunity to assess their preparedness for expansion. 
A. ASSESSMENT
In 2016, the DOE, in partnership 
with the Philippine Nuclear 
Research Institute (PNRI), 
availed technical assistance 
from the IAEA151 to assess the 
possibility of the entry of 
nuclear power in the country 
under a technical cooperation 
project (IAEA TCP-PHI2011)
titled, “Assessing the 
Development of Nuclear Power 
Program in the Philippines 
(Phase I).”

Figure 97. IAEA's MILESTONE APPROACH IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF NUCLEAR POWER PROGRAMIn compliance with the 
mandate of the DOE, the 
Philippine Nuclear Energy 
Program Implementing 
Organization (NEPIO) was 
established on 24 October 
2016 through Department 
Order (DO) 2016-10-0013. 
The creation of the DOENEPIO was one of the 
major recommendations 
during the IAEA’s 
conference on the 
Prospects of Nuclear 
Power in the Asia Pacific 
region hosted by the 
Philippines in August 2016.
Following the IAEA’s 
Milestones Approach, the establishment of the DOE-NEPIO places the Philippines in Phase 1 before 
Milestone 1 (Figure 97). The DOE-NEPIO coordinates the tasks and activities of the organizations 
involved in nuclear infrastructure development as its mandate. The DOE Undersecretary and an 
Assistant Secretary serves as Chair and Vice-Chair, respectively, of the DOE-NEPIO. The DOE-NEPIO
is divided into technical working groups (TWGs) for a specific infrastructure issue under the 
concerned DOE Bureau/Service Directors. Heads of the TWGs form part of the Steering Committee 
to ensure the effective and timely implementation of NEPIO's functions and responsibilities.
The TWGs’ mandate is to work on the specific infrastructure issues on the development of Nuclear 
Power that needs an in-depth study before embarking on a nuclear power program (Figures 98
and 99).
Under Phase 1 of the Milestone Approach, the DOE-NEPIO conducted the Energy Planning Studies 
(EPS) and Pre-Feasibility Studies 2017 of Nuclear Infrastructure Issues (PFS 2017) with the technical 
assistance of the IAEA under TC-PHI2011 project. The studies support the assessment of the 19 
infrastructure issues necessary for drafting the country’s national position to embark on nuclear 
energy program.

carbon technology (Figure 100). This 
will push the greenhouse gas 
emission (GHG) to increase 
significantly under the Business-AsUsual (BAU) Scenario. Under a 
Sustainable Scenario 1 (Sustain1), the 
GHG emission reduces by 30.0 
percent with LNG replacing coal by 
more than half of its share by 2050 
coupled with the maximum 
utilization of renewable energy with 
over 20-gigawatt (GW) capacity by 
2030. This increases the total 
installed capacity by 18.0 percent due 
to a higher share of variable RE 
(VRE)152. Higher LNG importation 
impacts energy security through
increased dependence on imported 
fuel.
The second sustainable scenario 
option (Sustain2) includes nuclear 
power, which will displace a portion 
of coal (Figure 101) resulting in a more 
diversified mix in both the BAU and 
Sustain1 scenarios, which signifies a 
more secure and reliable mix. The 
system cost decreases under 
Sustain2 as compared with the Sustain1 scenario. Nuclear Power comes in as early as 2027 under 
the Sustain2 scenario.
Sensitivity Analysis
The study further simulated a sensitivity analysis to determine the factors affecting the entry of 
nuclear power generation in the power mix. Results show the following:
▪ A 20.0 percent increase of nuclear power plant investment cost delays the entry of nuclear 
power by five (5) years, or moved to 2032;
▪ A 20.0 percent decrease in electricity demand by 2030 and 30.0 percent by 2040 and 
onwards delay the entry of nuclear power plant by two (2 ) years or 2029;
▪ A 20.0 percent decrease in LNG price shows no impact;
▪ A 20.0 percent increase in investment cost of nuclear power plant and 20.0 decrease in 
demand by 2030 and 30.0 percent by 2040 and onwards, and combined with 20.0 percent 
decrease in demand delay the entry by two years or 2029; and,
152 VREs such as wind and solar have a lower capacity factor than other technologies due to the availability of their energy sources
Figure 100. EPS GENERATION MIX by Scenario
Figure 101. EPS TOTAL INSTALLED CAPACITY MIX by Scenario▪ Entry of variable renewable energy (VRE) sources with storage battery complements the 
inclusion of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) within Visayas and Mindanao grids by 2042 and 
2041, respectively, but delays the introduction of a large reactor by three (3) years or 2030.
In summary, the study finds that 
natural gas and renewables, as 
clean energy options, compete 
with each other; thus, the need for 
other low carbon technologies to 
lower coal shares in the power mix. 
Nuclear power significantly 
mitigates GHG emission and is 
complementary to natural gas and 
renewables in power generation. 
The sensitivity analysis shows that 
the entry of nuclear power is 
feasible as a mitigation option but 
it can be delayed depending on the 
level of electricity demand and 
investment cost. 
Conclusion and Findings of Pre-Feasibility Studies on Infrastructure Issues
The assessment of the 19 infrastructure issues entails the following measures to address major 
challenges and gaps under Phase 1 of the Milestone Approach of IAEA:
 
▪ Push for the passage of a comprehensive nuclear law with a provision for the establishment 
of a separate and independent nuclear regulatory authority that will ensure nuclear safety;
▪ Amend and review of the Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA) to provide for the 
inclusion of nuclear power in its provision (ownership, funding and financing aspects);
▪ Conduct further study to consider the possible sites in the electric grid and assess its system 
impact, as well as guarantee environmental impact assessment during the licensing process; 
▪ Ensure stronger commitment among government agencies and other stakeholders in the 
public and private sectors; 
▪ Mitigate the negative perception about nuclear energy that is still prevalent despite present 
technology and access to information through a broad-based and updated communication 
plan to address stakeholder issues; 
▪ Develop/enhance knowledge and competence on nuclear safety of officials and professionals 
working on the nuclear power program (NEPIO, academe, regulatory body, and operator); 
and, 
▪ Expand the coverage of the current national nuclear security plan (NNSP) to include the 
physical protection of nuclear power plants, including cyber-security.
Figure 102. EPS RESULT: SUSTAIN II SCENARIO, CAPACITY MIX VS. 
GENERATION MIX (Gen)B. PLANS AND PROGRAMS
NUCLEAR POWER PROGRAM ROADMAP
The Nuclear Power 
Program (NPP) Roadmap 
was established for the 
guidance of the 
implementation and 
timeline of activities of 
the NEPIO based on the 
earliest optimal entry of 
nuclear energy by 2027, 
and findings of the prefeasibility studies, as 
shown in Figure 103.
The NPP Roadmap has 
three phases as follows: 
In Phase 1, the DOE-NEPIO conducts studies taking into account the considerations before 
launching an NPP. These include the energy planning and pre-feasibility studies done by the DOENEPIO and the 19 infrastructure issues identified in the Milestone Approach (Figure 99). Those 
hard infrastructure issues include pre-development stage studies for NPP. The DOE-NEPIO hosted 
the IAEA peer review to assess the undertakings under Phase 1.
The activities for 2019 to 2022 are set for Phase 2 of the roadmap, as well as the milestone 
approach. The result of the peer review will pave the way for NEPIO to undertake preparations for 
a knowledgeable commitment for the NPP. After policy decision has been taken, the DOE-NEPIO 
will then establish a management team, create an independent regulatory body that will ensure 
the safe, secure and peaceful use of nuclear power by ratifying related treaties and conventions, 
establish bilateral agreements with international suppliers, and develop policies, guidelines and 
procedures for procurement and contracting procedures. At the end of Phase 2, the DOE-NEPIO 
will need another peer review through IAEA to evaluating the country’s NPP.
The result of the evaluation at the end of Phase 2 will indicate the readiness to contract and 
construct a nuclear power project under Phase 3. At Phase 3, the role of the DOE-NEPIO will 
diminish paving the way for the establishment of the Technical Support Organizations (TSO), and 
the Research and Development Programs, while the independent regulatory body will have to 
start implementing its guidelines for its rules and regulations of putting-up a nuclear power project. 
At the end of this stage, a self-evaluation is needed to assess the programs and the readiness to 
commission and operate the first nuclear power plant.
The self-evaluation at the end of each phase means that the DOE-NEPIO and the IAEA take into 
account all issues that may hinder a nuclear power program before the construction of a nuclear 
power plant. 
Figure 103. NPP ROADMAPIMPLEMENTATION OF KEY ACTIVITIES FOR 2018-2019
A. Establishing the National Position
The DOE-NEPIO submitted the 
recommendation for a “National 
Position to Embark on a Nuclear 
Power Program” to the Office of 
the President in April 2018. The 
national position was based on 
the Energy Planning and PreFeasibility Studies, which 
evaluated the status of the 19 
nuclear infrastructure issues in 
the Philippines. Among the 
action agenda for the President 
included in the national position 
are the following:
1. Declaration that the 
Philippines is open to nuclear 
power and ready to embark 
on a NPP;
2. Certification as urgent of a 
Comprehensive Nuclear Law or any equivalent law to establish a separate and independent 
nuclear regulatory authority; and,
3. Issuance of an Executive Order (EO) to expand the current composition of the DOE-NEPIO to 
cover other relevant government agencies, academe and representatives from the private 
sector.
A "National Position" is a technical term used in developing a nuclear power program that serves 
as the premise statement of a country's preliminary position and evaluation subject to validation 
by addressing the 19 infrastructure issues or gaps based on IAEA standards. If the issues are 
addressed and validation are successful, the position will be elevated as a "National Decision," 
which would then be the backbone of an NPP.
A National Position must cover and provide the following: (1) economic, social, political 
environmental and national energy directions of a country; (2) commitment to safe, secure and 
peaceful development of nuclear power program; (3) recognition of international and national 
legal arrangements including the establishment of an independent regulatory body with the 
commitment to cooperate with the international community (i.e., IAEA) to ensure a safe, secure, 
transparent and peaceful nuclear power program; and, (4) strengthening stakeholders' 
involvement. Such should likewise lead to a National Policy Recommendation to put a 
determination on closure on the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant (BNPP) rehabilitation, or a 
construction of new nuclear power plants.
B. Self- and Peer Evaluation of the NPP Phase 1
Having done the studies for Phase 1 and submitted the recommendation for a national position to 
the Office of the President, the DOE-NEPIO saw the need to conduct a Self- and Peer Evaluation of 
Phase 1 activities to assess whether the program is ready to move to Phase 2. Consequently, the 
Photo taken during the opening program of the INIR Missions Phase 1 which was participated in by 
Secretary Alfonso G. Cusi (3rd from left, in front), followed by Dir. Dohee Hans of IAEA, Milko Kovachev, 
the Team Leader for the IAEA INIR Mission Team, and NEPIO members led by the NEPIO Chair 
Undersecretary Donato D. MarcosSelf-Evaluation Report (SER) was submitted to IAEA on 31 October 2018 as a prerequisite for the 
conduct of the “Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure Review (INIR) Mission. The SER is a summary of 
all the studies and activities implemented by the DOE-NEPIO-TWGs in Phase 1. The preparation of 
SER and the conduct of INIR was supported by the TC-PHI2012 project of IAEA.
The Philippines hosted the INIR Mission Phase 1 on 11-17 December 2018 in Shangri-La Manila and 
attended by 13 experts commissioned and funded by IAEA. It evaluated the status of the national 
infrastructure issues in Phase I of the IAEA’s Milestone Approach. Further, the review identified 
areas needing actions to achieve the Milestone Goal in Phase I. The IAEA team also provided 
recommendations and suggestions, which can be used by the government and national 
stakeholder institutions in the preparation of an action plan addressing the gaps identified in the 
review.
The key benefits of an INIR Mission include:
1. Providing the Member States with an 
opportunity to evaluate their NPP 
based on the Milestones publication; 
2. Drawing attention to areas requiring 
additional work; 
3. Providing a forum for peer discussions 
and exchange of experiences on 
infrastructure development; and,
4. Making available to senior officials of 
the host Member State, an 
independent peer review report on the 
status of the infrastructure for NPP.
Hand-over of the Official INIR Mission for Phase I Report
On 30 October 2019, the IAEA represented by Deputy Director Mikhail Chudakov and Nuclear 
Infrastructure Development Section (NIDS) Head Milko Kovachev turned over the official INIR 
Sec. Alfonso G. Cusi giving his welcome remarks to the IAEA delegates and NEPIO members 
at the Shangri-La Manila on 11 December 2018

government through Energy Secretary Alfonso G. 
Cusi and DOE-NEPIO Chairperson Undersecretary 
Donato D. Marcos. The ceremony was held in F1 
Hotel, BGC, Taguig City and attended by 
representatives from different government 
agencies, academe, and media. 
It was concluded by the IAEA-INIR team that the 
Philippines is committed to a systematic approach in 
finalizing its nuclear power strategy and completing 
the associated infrastructure development. The 
country likewise recognizes the importance of open 
and transparent public communication and the 
need to include a broader range of stakeholders in 
preparations to introduce nuclear power. Currently, 
the DOE-NEPIO has conducted stakeholders’ 
involvement and the public perception survey.
Key Areas for Further Action
1. Need to involve a broader range of stakeholders in completing the work required to enable a 
national commitment to introduce nuclear power.
2. Develop a legal and regulatory framework that ensures and demonstrates a commitment to 
safety, security and non-proliferation.
3. Further develop its understanding of and enhance its approaches to several issues related to a 
future nuclear power project.
The DOE-NEPIO is strengthening the capacity of its technical personnel through collaboration with 
international agencies. It is also strengthening the stakeholders’ involvement through the 
development of a Comprehensive Public Communication Plan on Nuclear Energy from the results 
of the recently conducted Public Perception Survey on Nuclear in the Philippines.
C. Public Perception Survey on Nuclear Energy 
The DOE, in coordination with the Social Weather Stations (SWS), conducted a public perception 
survey on the use of nuclear energy in the country from 27 April – 12 May 2019. 
Objective. The purpose of the survey was to provide a scientifically established basis on the 
acceptability of nuclear energy for power generation in the country in support of the proposed EO 
for the country to embark on an NPP to be submitted by the DOE to the President. Likewise, the 
survey aimed to provide scientifically acquired information in the preparation of the 
Comprehensive Communication Plan and Strategy in the engagement of the public and other 
stakeholders for the development of NPP.
Methodology. The survey involved face-to-face interviews with 4,250 Filipino adults aged 18 and 
above nationwide and covered 17 study regions. The target population was the noninstitutionalized population aged 18 and above who are Filipino citizens and currently residing in 
the Philippines.Findings. The survey results indicated that nuclear energy should be entrenched in the energy mix. 
Generally, the results impart that nuclear energy brings more benefits than risks.
The survey showed positive or 
favorable perception with 79.0 
percent approval/acceptability for 
possible use (and rehabilitation) of 
the BNPP and 65.0 percent 
approval/acceptability of building a 
new nuclear power plant. Further, 
the survey revealed that 70.0 
percent of the respondents prefer 
to source the money for the 
construction of a nuclear power 
plant from the government funds, a 
good indicator that nuclear energy is 
acceptable.
The majority of the respondents 
expressed interest to learn more 
about Nuclear Energy. The 
preferred primary means of 
communication to reach the general public based on the result of the survey are television, 
internet, social media, radio, and Information, Education and Communication (IEC) campaign.
D. Integrated Work Plan for the Nuclear Power Program
The Consultancy Meeting for the Integrated Work Plan (IWP) of the Philippines was held in Vienna, 
Austria last 12-15 November 2019 and attended by a delegation from the DOE-NEPIO, the 
Departement of Science and Technology (DOST), and DOST-Philippine Nuclear Research Institute 
(PNRI). Its main objective was to review the Philippines’ IWP to organize and prioritize future 
cooperation in the field of nuclear power infrastructure development with the IAEA.
The IWP as defined by the IAEA is a strategic document describing the relevant activities delivered 
by the Agency to support nuclear infrastructure development in a specific Member State. The 
IWP covers a period of two to three years, and identifies activities implemented through Technical 
Cooperation (TC) projects, as well as direct assistance activities from the relevant agencies’
technical departments and the Office of Legal Affairs (OLA). It will be reviewed and updated once 
a year in a joint meeting of the Member State and Agency Core Team. 
E. Joint Pre-Feasibility Study for the Deployment of SMR in CEZA, Philippines
On 27-28 February 2019, the members of the DOE-NEPIO Steering Committee and TWG members 
held a kick-off Meeting with representatives of Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP). The 
meeting discussed the Small Modular Reactor (SMR) Technology as presented by experts from 
Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) and King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable 
Energy (K.A.CARE). 
Front (L-R) Syahril Syahril (IAEA), DOST Assistant Secretary Teodoro M. Gatchalian, DOE Assistant 
Secretary Gerardo D. Erguiza, Philippine Ambassador to Austria Maria Cleofe R. Natividad, PNRI 
Dir. Carlo A. Arcilla, Mr. Milko Kovachev (IAEA), Eric Mathet (IAEA) and other delegates during 
the IWP in Vienna, AustriaThe said meeting involved 
preliminary exchange of 
information between the DOE 
and KHNP to collaborate on the 
conduct of a Pre-Feasibility 
Study (FS) on Systemintegrated Modular Advanced 
Reactor Technology (SMART). 
The purpose of the Pre-FS was 
to review the feasibility of 
SMART construction in the 
Cagayan Economic Zone 
Authority (CEZA) in Sta Ana, 
Cagayan. The CEZA is being 
developed as a hub for trade, 
commerce, finance, technology and leisure area, thus needs a stable supply of power to meet its 
future requirement for electricity. 
A site characteristic survey was conducted by the experts from KHNP and the DOE in March 2019 
in CEZA. Prior to the said site suvery, the Siting TWG of the DOE-NEPIO undertook a Field 
Verification Survey and Ocular Inspection in the proposed site(s) using Preliminary Siting Criteria.
The DOE and KHNP collaboration on Pre-FS on SMART was part of the Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) signed on 27 July 2018 for comprehensive cooperation on the establishment 
of infrastructure for possible nuclear energy projects in the Philippines. The “Pre-FS on SMART
Deployment in CEZA” was drafted through combined efforts of the DOE-NEPIO-TWGs, CEZA and 
KHNP. The final version of the Pre-FS was turned over in December 2019.
DEVELOPMENT IN THE NUCLEAR POWER PROGRAM ACTIVITIES IN 2020
A. The 10th Nuclear Energy Cooperation Sub sector Network Annual Meeting
The Philippines Chaired the 10th Nuclear Energy Cooperation Sub sector Network (NEC-SSN) 
Annual Meeting held virtually last 23 June 2020. The meeting discussed the progress and plans of 
NEC-SSN for ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation (APAEC) Phase I: 2016-2020. Likewise, 
the Member States agreed and adopted the key strategy, outcome-based strategies, action plans 
and annual priorities including the engagement of dialogue partners and international 
organizations for the APAEC Phase II: 2021-2025. 
B. Executive Order 116 s. 2020
The EO 116 s. 2020 titled “Directing a Study for the Adoption of a National Position on Nuclear Energy 
Program, Constituting a Nuclear Energy Program Inter-Agency Committee, and for Other Purposes”
was signed by President Rodrigo Duterte on 24 July 2020. The EO establishes the Nuclear Energy 
Program-Inter-Agency Committee (NEP-IAC), which is tasked to conduct a study for the adoption 
of a National Position on NPP in accordance with pertinent IAEA guidelines, relevant laws, rules 
and regulations. The NEP-IAC shall be composed of the following agencies and offices:
Chairperson : Department of Energy (DOE)
Vice-Chairperson : Department of Science and Technology (DOST)
Senior Undersecretary Jesus Cristino P. Posadas (middle) DOE-NEPIO Vice-Chair Assistant Secretary 
Gerardo D. Erguiza Jr. (left) and KHNP VP Lim Seung Yeol during the SMART Pre-FS turn over.Members : Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR)
Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG)

DRIVERS AND BARRIERS for NPP
The challenges identified in the development of an NPP are:
1. Approval of the National Position on the NPP. While the EO 116 expands the membership of 
the NEPIO to a multi-sectoral composite team, the government still needs to conduct a study 
to support the national position. 
2. Establishment of an Independent Regulatory Body through a Comprehensive Nuclear Law. 
The DOE-NEPIO supports the passage of the Comprehensive Nuclear Bill to pave the way for 
an encompassing legislative and regulatory framework to address the issues and demands for 
nuclear safety and security.
3. Public acceptance for a nuclear power plant. A broad-based and updated communication plan 
should be developed to address stakeholder issues to effectively manage and change the 
negative perception about nuclear energy, which is still prevalent despite the present 
technology and access to information. 
4. Signing and ratification of relevant international instruments. While the Philippines is a Party 
to most of the relevant international instruments, the country should ratify the following 
important conventions/treaties, specifically related to the Convention on Nuclear Safety: (1) 
Joint Convention on the Safety Management of Spent Fuel and Safety Management of 
Radioactive Waste; and, (2) Amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of 
Nuclear Materials.The Department of Energy (DOE) renders efficient services through formulation and 
implementation of policies and programs that are relevant to the emerging needs of the energy 
sector to improve the quality of life of all Filipinos. Among the priorities within the planning 
horizon is to ensure an energy system that is resilient from risks and vulnerabilities of both natural 
and human-induced hazards. 
The promulgation of the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010 or Republic 
Act (RA) No. 10121 resulted in a paradigm shift – from disaster-centered response into four (4) 
thematic areas covering disaster mitigation, disaster preparedness, disaster response and disaster 
recovery and rehabilitation. Towards the goal of a “safer, adaptive and disaster-resilient 
communities,” the National Disaster Risk Reduction & Management Council (NDRRMC)153 has been 
strengthened to serve as the country’s focal entity in terms of disaster risk reduction. On the other 
hand, the DOE, pursuant to its mandate of ensuring energy access, shall formulate policies and 
establish standard operating procedures to have a coherent coordination mechanism among 
energy industry participants. 
It is within these premises where the Energy Resiliency Policy (ERP) has been formulated to guide 
the energy industries in adopting measures to enhance reliability and security of the energy 
system. While still in its infancy stage, the ERP has gained traction from the industry to focus on 
cooperation and partnership between the government and the private sector, and among energy 
participants as the benefits of working together in times of disasters are realized. 
A. ASSESSMENT
ADOPTION OF THE ENERGY RESILIENCY POLICY
On 17 January 2018, Secretary Alfonso G. Cusi signed Department Circular (DC) 2018-01-0001 titled 
“Adoption of Energy Resiliency in the Planning and Programming of the Energy Sector to Mitigate 
Potential Impacts of Disasters,” which aims to:
▪ Institutionalize the development, promotion and implementation of a comprehensive 
Resiliency Compliance Plan (RCP) to strengthen the capacity, promote a safety culture and 
disaster preparedness, and improve response mechanisms of the energy sector;
153 Formerly known as the National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC)▪ Strengthen existing infrastructure facilities to adapt to and withstand adverse conditions 
and disruptive events; 
▪ Incorporate mitigation 
improvements into the 
reconstruction and 
rehabilitation of damaged 
infrastructure in 
accordance with the Build 
Back Better principles;
▪ Improve operational and 
maintenance standards and 
practices to ensure efficient
restoration of energy 
supply in the aftermath of 
disruptive events; and
▪ Develop resiliency 
standards for future 
construction of energy 
facilities to ensure minimal damage and adoption of measures for timely recovery and 
restoration of energy supply.
The RCP intends to mainstream disaster risk reduction programs into planning and investments to 
ensure continuous delivery of and enhance existing energy infrastructure. It provides both 
engineering and non-engineering measures to ensure infrastructure and human resource disaster 
preparedness. Likewise, it encompasses activities such as stockpiling, system development and

RCP Submission For Compliance
Figure 105. COMPLIANCE RATE OF RCP SUBMISSION VS. ACTIVE 
PROJECTS, By Sectorplanning, response and recovery including disaster protocols (Figure 104). As of 30 July 2019, a 
total of 147 RCPs was submitted to the DOE across the different sectors (Figure 105).
Preparing and Planning for the “BIG” One
The Philippine Institute of 
Volcanology and Seismology 
(PHIVOLCS) recorded an average 
of 20 earthquakes a day. The “Big 
One” remains a big threat with an 
estimated magnitude of 7.2 
(intensity VIII) resulting from the 
movement of the West Valley Fault 
(WVF) system that will affect 
Metro Manila and other 
neighboring regions through 
massive destruction to 
infrastructure and facilities, among 
others. 
The DOE already started looking 
into the preparedness measures to 
ensure availability of energy supply in the event of an earthquake. This initiative has been 
established even before the passage of Executive Order (EO) No. 52 titled “Creating the Program 
Management Office for Earthquake Resiliency of the Greater Metro Manila Area” on 8 May 2018. This 
sets the proactive approach of the energy sector in tackling energy resiliency issues and concerns.
On 16 March 2018, the DOE in 
partnership with the 
Department of Science and 
Technology (DOST) –
PHILVOLCS, signed a 
Memorandum of Agreement 
(MOA) titled “Capacity 
Enhancement of the Energy 
Sector on Hazard, Risk 
Assessment and Exposure 
Database Development 
through the use of the Rapid 
Earthquake Damage 
Assessment System (REDAS) 
Software.” The REDAS, a 
locally developed software, provides a quick and near real-time simulated earthquake hazard 
information to help disaster managers assess the distribution and extent of the impacts of a strong 
earthquake. The software could help the energy sector decide and prioritize the deployment of 
timely operations. Further, it serves as a tool in convincing land use planners, policymakers, city 
and town development planners, and even local government executives to consider earthquake 
hazards in their planning and development efforts to have a long-term mitigation of seismic risks. 
On 02-07 September 2019, representatives from the DOE and National Electrification 
Administration (NEA) participated in the REDAS training at Kasa Luntian in Tagaytay City.
During the signing of MOA with the DOST-PHIVOLCS on the use of REDAS software
REDAS participants from various DOE Units and NEA together with the trainers from the DOST-PHIVOLCS 
led by Deputy Director Bartolome C. Bautista.As an off-shoot activity, a Focus Group Discussion (FGD) with about 15 energy industry players was 
conducted on 11 September 2019. The FGD was conducted to address issues and concerns raised 
during the workshop on the Updating of the National Contingency Plan for the "Big One", 
specifically on determining a collective Recovery Time Objective (RTO) for the industry,
information sharing and classification of confidentiality, sharing of resources and deployable 
assets, stockpiling and cross-training, to name a few.
The DOE also participated in various workshops on the standardization of the BCP template, 
development of the Public Service Continuity Plan (PSCP) and harmonization of the National 
Contingency Plan in preparation for the “Big One.” 
Updating of the National Energy Contingency Plan
The National Energy Contingency Plan (NECP) was developed to address both oil and power supply 
disruption. It was guided by the principles of prioritization in the restoration of electricity service 
for installations vital to national security, allocation of petroleum products for critical and strategic 
activities, and considerations of associated effects on domestic socio-political stability that shall be 
addressed immediately by concerned agencies. 
The updating of NECP seeks to cover the following: (1) exposure database of energy facilities; (2) 
identify possible scenario and assumptions (including associated effects on domestic sociopolitical stability arising from energy interruptions); (3) develop the concept of operations 
indicating the proposed systems and capabilities that may be employed to achieve the desired 
objectives; and (3) develop an organizational structure, including command structure and control 
mechanisms, for emergencies and disasters and harmonize it with other plans.
The Workshop on updating the NECP was held on July 24-25, 2019 at F1 Hotel Manila, Bonifacio Global City, Taguig City.
Participants from the Power & Oil Sectors during the NECP Writeshop at Quest Hotel, Clark, PampangaAs the National Capital Region (NCR) was among the pilot areas for the Nationwide Simultaneous 
Earthquake Drill, MERALCO was given opportunity to test its BCP and re-validate its coordination 
mechanisms during disasters on 14 November 2019. The simulation exercise was evaluated by the 
Office of Civil Defense (OCD-NCR) and the DOE. Results of the exercise showed improvement in 
some of the response protocols, but MERALCO was generally able to perform those indicated in 
its BCP. 
The DOE likewise conducted a seminar / forum on resiliency planning for the downstream oil 
industry players to revisit and/or improve their respective Downstream Oil Contingency Plans and 
the Downstream Oil industry Resiliency Plans on 20 - 22 November 2019. The activity with a theme 
“Resiliency: Beyond Business Continuity, HOPE” provided current challenges the industry must 
prepare for and address relative to mitigating the impact of natural disasters. 
Strengthening Partnerships
To further widen the reach of 
promoting energy resiliency, the 
DOE and the Safety and Health 
Association of the Philippine Energy 
Sector, Inc. (SHAPES Inc.) entered 
into an MOU on 17 August 2018 
detailing the engagement of 
different stakeholders in supporting 
the development and 
implementation of policies, 
strategies, programs and activities 
to institutionalize mechanisms to 
prepare for, respond to and recover 
from disasters.
Recognizing the participation of private industry players in the energy sector, the TFER pursued 
such partnership for the implementation of policy framework, strategies, programs and activities 
to link government agencies, private sector organizations and other partners to attaining a

of DOST-PHIVOLCS, President Rene Meily of PDRF, and Other Officials from MERALCO, OCD and PNPSECURING ENERGY FACILITIES DURING EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS
TROPICAL CYCLONE 
The geographical location of the Philippines makes the country one of the most vulnerable to natural 
hazards, experiencing about an average of 20 tropical cyclones per year, causing flash floods, storm 
surges and landslides. The Task Force on Energy Resiliency (TFER), created under DC 2018-01-0001, 
monitored and responded to the following tropical cyclones, which affected the country:
2018
Typhoon “Ompong” (International Name: Mangkhut) recorded peak intensity of 205 kilometer per hour 
(kph) and made landfall on 15 September 2018 over the remote portion of Baggao, Cagayan. It was the 
strongest tropical cyclone to hit the country affecting mostly the energy facilities in Northern Luzon 
and some parts of Southern Luzon. The NEA activated its Task Force Kapatid, a bayanihan program 
that mobilized 43 contingents from the different electric cooperatives (ECs) and private distribution 
utilities (DUs) to hasten the power restoration efforts in Cagayan.
Typhoon “Rosita” (International Name: YUTU) entered the country on 27 October 2018, barely a month 
after the devastation of Typhoon Ompong and only a few days after the completion of power 
restoration efforts of the affected ECs. Following the track of Typhoon Ompong, it affected the 
Northern and Central Luzon with an intensity of 200 kilometer per hour (kph). Typhoon Rosita affected 
Northern and Central Luzon.
Tropical Depression Samuel had maximum sustained winds of 55 kph and gustiness up to 65 kph and 
made landfall on 21 November 2018 affecting energy facilities in some parts of the Visayas region and 
Southern Luzon.
Tropical Depression Usman was the last recorded tropical cyclone towards the end of 2018 but 
eventually weakened into a Low-Pressure Area (LPA) upon landfall in the vicinity of Eastern Samar on 
29 December 2018. There were no significant effects reported during the LPA. However, the consistent 
moderate to heavy rains affected some energy facilities in Luzon and Visayas regions.
2019
While people expected 2019 to be the tipping point of 
catastrophic earthquakes, two (2) waves of Typhoons 
still made landfall before the end of the year (Table 83). 
On 25 November 2019, Typhoon “Tisoy” initially 
formed as a tropical depression in the Pacific and 
developed into a Category 4-equivalent typhoon 
before making a landfall on 05 December 2019 in the 
Bicol Region, which left heavy damages in the sector.
Followed by Typhoon “Ursula” that a made landfall 
just before t Christmas day and affected mostly the 
provinces in Visayas region.
Typhoon “Tisoy” (International Name: Kammuri) had a 
maximum sustained wind from 165 kph to 215 kph,
which caused severe damages in the energy facilities in Regions III, CALABARZON, MIMAROPA, V, VIII,

ETFE was composed mainly of representatives 
from the energy family, key support 
organizations and the security group. 
Synchronized Barangay and Sangguniang 
Kabataan Election (BSKE) 2018
Adequate and reliable power supply was ensured before, during, and after the BSKE 2018, though 
there were reports of isolated line tripping in some areas that were immediately 
restored/responded by the concerned agencies. The active participation of the energy family in 
the BSKE 2018 was recognized by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) with the 
commendation award given to the DOE for ensuring sufficient power supply during the election.
2019 National Mid-term Election 
The COMELEC Resolution No. 10471 deputized government agencies to provide sufficient 
uninterrupted electrical power supply and secure the transmission infrastructure and facilities 
during critical days of the election. In view of this, the ETFE was activated and a series of 
preparedness meetings were held. 
The DOE, as the Chair of the TFER, activated the ETFE on 04 February 2019 through DC 2018-05-
0014 that defined responsibilities of the agencies including the tasks for monitoring and reporting 
of preparedness measures, status of facilities and other incidents monitored. 
For proper and effective coordination among the concerned agencies, energy family and the 
security group, the Energy Command Center was activated on 10 May 2019 located at the DOE 
premises. Likewise, Command Centers of the power sector located nationwide were activated as 
well from 12-14 May 2019, while the DOE technical personnel were detailed in the COMELEC 
Monitoring and Command Center (CMCC) in Parañaque City. The NEA Power Task Force Election 
(NPTE) 2019 was created pursuant to the NEA Office Order No. 2019-033 to ensure a 24-hr 
operation of the ECs before, during and after elections. On the other hand, the TransCo was tasked 
to oversee the operations status of the grid through the NGCP’s National and Regional Command 
and Control Centers. 
The NPC set up the Operation Center Head Office located at the NPC compound in Quezon City 
that functioned as the central point for receiving reports from Mindanao and Satellite Operation 
Centers in off-grid areas. The Mindanao Satellite Operation Center located in the NPC Mindanao 
Energy Secretary Alfonso G. Cusi received a commendation from the COMELEC 
Acting Chairman Al A. Parreño on 23 August 2018 for ensuring sufficient power

Immediately after the eruption, the DOE conducted electrical 
inspections of service drops, panel conditions, and load types 
of lighting, fans, and charging to ensure that proper power 
services are being provided in the evacuation centers on the 
affected areas. Further, the DOE team distributed emergency 
lights, portable solar power lamps, solar power banks, and 
clothing to volunteers.Likewise, the DOE established a Bayanihan 
Energy Service 24/7 hotlines to cater to all 
energy-related concerns during the 
Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ). 
On 18 March 2020, a Memorandum from 
the Energy Secretary was issued calling on 
public and private power sector 
corporations to defer payments of 
obligations and dues for 30 days after the 
conclusion of the ECQ period on 14 April 
2020.
Upon the passage of Republic Act No. 11469 
or “Bayanihan to Heal as One Act,” Secretary
Cusi released a Special Order for the Creation of an “Energy Committee under the Bayanihan to Heal 
as One Act,” to ensure compliance to the said Act on 02 April 2020.
The DOE also directed the power stakeholders to submit their respective Business Continuity Plan 
(BCP) under the ECQ and further expanded to include energy resource development and 
downstream oil stakeholders.
On 6 April 2020, Secretary Cusi issued DC 2020-04-0008 titled “Rationalizing the Utilization of ER 1-
94 Fund by Host Local Government Units in Response to COVID-19 Public Health Emergency,” which 
provides for the utilization of such funds by the host LGUs to strengthen their programs and 
measures against COVID-19 during this period. The funds can be used for the following: 
▪ Facilitation of mass testing by providing and constructing facilities and/or acquiring proper 
medical testing kits to detect COVID-19; 
▪ Provision of an emergency subsidy in the form of non-food to low income households while the 
State of Public Health Emergency is still in effect; and 
▪ Adoption of measures to minimize disruption in the supply chain, among others.
On 07 May 2020, an Advisory on Providing 
Grace Period to all Power Sector Bills Falling 
Due During the ECQ as extended until 15 May 
2020 was released for guidance of all 
electric power industry participants. All 
bills being paid during the extended grace 
period shall bear no interest, penalties, 
fees and charges.
In response to the issued Administrative 
Order (AO) of the DOH, the DOE released 
Department Order (DO) 2020-04-007 on 29 
April 2020 titled “Providing for Minimum 
Health Standards for COVID-19 Mitigation to DOE Personnel and its Workplace and Shared for 
Application to All Players and Stakeholders in the Entire Energy Industry.”
As a result of submitted BCPs of the energy stakeholders, the DOE issued COVID-19 Response 
Protocol through AO 2020-05-0001 on 21 May 2020. The Protocol's general framework is based on 
Energy Secretary Alfonso G. Cusi during the Senate Committee of the Whole briefing 
on crucial sector updates amid the COVID-19 situation in the Philippines on 21 May 
2020
Energy Secretary Alfonso G. Cusi asked the executives of the Manila Electric Company 
(MERALCO) to explain the spike in May bills and other related complaints including the 
imposition of convenience fee on 26 May 2020.the following interventions: (1) Prevention, (2) Detection, (3) Isolation, (4) Treatment, (5)
Reintegration to the Workforce, and (6) Adapting to the "New Normal.
For the DOE and its attached agencies, the COVID-19 Response Protocol shall be incorporated in 
their respective Public Service Continuity Plans, while energy industry players are required to 
incorporate the same into their BCPs, or their equivalent.
Subsequently, a PSCP was released through DO 2020-06-001 on 26 June 2020 to established
protocols, measures and strategies for managing the immediate consequences of the COVID-19 
pandemic for DOE.
B. PLANS AND PROGRAMS
Cognizant of the vital contribution of energy in fuelling the economy, any disruption or failure in 
the energy system would have negative consequences on the country’s economic activities and 
daily life of the people. With this backdrop, the development of the energy sector Disaster Risk 
Reduction and Management (DRRM) plans, policies, programs, and standards operating 
procedures is crucial to ensuring continuous delivery of energy services to the economy and the 
public. 
The energy sector is moving toward mainstreaming the culture of resiliency through strengthening 
the energy infrastructure, establishing standards and systems, formulating response and recovery 
protocols, mitigation/contingency plans and activities to address the impacts of disasters on 
energy supply and services. Integrating energy resiliency into development planning and disaster 
operations of the energy sector will propel the formulation of DRRM plans, frameworks and 
policies of the energy sector, conduct of operations during emergencies and disasters and ensure 
building back better reconstruction and rehabilitation of affected energy facilities. Key activities 
initially identified are:
▪ Developing a sector-based preparedness plan encompassing capacity building, energy 
response activities including standard operating procedures and other operational 
manuals linkages;
▪ Designing and programming the disaster risk and reduction (DRR) activities of the energy 
sector;
▪ Conducting researches on related DRR programs, policies, and activities of the energy 
sector;
▪ Formulating DRRM risk assessment and plan, framework and policies of the energy sector;
▪ Disseminating information and raise public awareness of DRRM related activities of the 
energy sector;
▪ Conducting continuous monitoring and mobilizing personnel during emergencies; 
▪ Establishing linkages with the stakeholders before, during and after emergencies and 
disasters;
▪ Conducting comprehensive damage and loss assessment in the energy sector;
▪ Conducting periodic monitoring and inspection of rehabilitation programs and projects of 
the energy sector;
▪ Formulating standards for rehabilitation development for inclusion in the DRR measures in 
the energy sector; and,
▪ Assisting in processing and evaluating proposals for funding of projects and activities.WAY FORWARD 
Energy resiliency remains a flagship program of the DOE. With lessons learned from previous 
tropical cyclones, earthquakes and even human-induced disasters, the promulgation of the ERP 
propelled the advocacy to mainstream energy resiliency into programs, plans and activities of all 
industry participants.
With the changing landscape of disaster risk reduction, the energy resiliency put priority actions 
(Figure 106) to improve the whole value chain of the sector in terms of strengthening the ability of 
the energy system to withstand the impact of hazards and recover from any disruption of the 
energy supply.
The submission of the RCP, along with the set programs, paves the way for the formulation of the 
ERP that constitutes short-, medium- and long-term plans, programs and activities. The NECP for 
oil and power will also be updated to strengthen preparedness, mitigation, and response and 
recovery measures to have continuous energy supply during emergencies and disasters. It is the 
government’s priority to have a faster recovery from projected threat of the “Big One.” As an end 
goal and to institutionalize resiliency mechanisms, energy resiliency standards will be formulated 
to safeguard energy facilities. As a contribution to the fight against COVID-19 pandemic and for 
future similar diseases, the DOE formulated COVID-19 Response Protocol and the PSCP shall be 
updated periodically. 
With an overall objective of mainstreaming the DRRM plans, frameworks and policies into the 
energy sector, the Energy Resiliency Roadmap, together with the development of the Energy 
Resiliency Standards, will set the course and direction of the sector toward achieving a higher level 
of resiliency to disaster. This will be developed in sectoral approach to include the upstream oil 
and gas, downstream oil and gas, power, renewable energy, and energy utilization. The roadmap 
will be aligned to and guided with the principles stipulated in the Energy Resiliency Policy.
Moving forward for an energy resilient Philippines with a shared vision of stable, secure, sufficient, 
accessible and reasonably-priced energy, the DOE continues to strive for greater energy supply 
security as a precursor for sustainable economic development.
Figure 106. WAY FORWARDThe Philippines builds its diplomatic and international relations based on its national interest. It is 
a universal policy to collaborate and cooperate with concrete and tangible intention of reaping 
values or benefits from the competencies and strength of other states or international and 
regional groupings. Most importantly, the Philippines exerts enormous effort to provide a 
conducive environment and seamless opportunities for local and foreign investors. 
The country is blessed with abundant natural wealth including untapped indigenous energy 
resources. It used to rank second in the world in geothermal energy production (next to the United 
States, and the Department of Energy (DOE) is resolute to regain the spot. With its strategic 
location and archipelagic character, it serves as an ideal trading hub in the Asia-Pacific region, a 
perfect base for business and a critical entry point of millions of people in the ASEAN market. It has 
one of the highest literacy rates in the region, with 93.9 percent of the population capable of being 
trained for essential skills and competencies. Its unique edge comes from the high level of English 
proficiency of the Filipinos. In fact, the Philippines is the third largest English-speaking country in 
the world and the top-ranked country in the world for Business English. 
A. SUCCESSFUL COLLABORATIONS WITH DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS IN 
RECENT YEARS
Aside from the recent Executive Orders (EOs) and Memorandum Circulars (MCs) that the 
government issued to make the environment attractive to investors, the Philippine energy sector 
has a good track records in terms of engagement and collaboration with various international 
organizations. The following are some of the recent notable initiatives and successful 
collaboration:
1. Access to Sustainable Energy Program
The Access to Sustainable Energy Program (ASEP) is a European Union Assistance to the Philippine 
energy sector with total funding support amounting to Euro 66 million. The program aims to 
promote sustainable energy for all, and help meets rural electrification targets using renewable 
energy (RE), wider adoption of efficient use of energy. It intends to assist the government in 
expanding the application of sustainable energy to meet the growing energy needs of the country 
and provide greater energy access to poor and marginalized sector in accordance with the 
Philippine Development Plan (PDP).
Chapter XII. Specifically, the program envisages to 
generate more electricity from renewables, 
greater application of energy efficiency and 
conservation measures, and expand access 
of the poor to affordable, disaster-resilient 
energy. Under this Program, around 
100,000 to 150,000 poor households in 
remote areas will be provided with access 
to electricity utilizing innovative energy 
solutions. Further, a 20 megawatts (MW) 
of renewables are to be installed, and 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
equivalent to the discharged of a 50-MW 
coal-fired power plant are to be avoided by 
2020.
The Program has three (3) components, namely:
a. Technical Assistance (TA) Component with three sub-components: 
i. Rural Electrification,
ii. Energy Efficiency (EE) and
iii. Cross-cutting Activities.
b. Investment Support for Renewable Energy Component, which the World Bank (WB) is 
implementing with three sub-components:
i. Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Mainstreaming,
ii. PV Rural Network Solar, and
iii. TA for the National Electrification Administration (NEA), Energy Regulatory 
Commission (ERC), Renewable Energy for Rural Electrification (RE4RE), Bangsamoro, 
and Climate Resilience.
c. Call for Proposals for pro-poor and climate resilient energy solutions, which is implemented 
by the EU Delegation under direct management.
As of December 2019, ASEP completed a feasibility study (FS) on rural electrification, and installed 
10,000 units Solar Homes System (SHS) and contracted seven (7) projects in various stages of 
capacity building, procurement and arrangements with counterpart institutions and the local 
government units (LGUs). The Program likewise supported the formulation of the Implementing 
Rules and Regulations (IRR) of the Republic Act (RA) 11285 or the “Energy Efficiency and 
Conservation Act of 2019.” 
2. Development for Renewable Energy Applications Mainstreaming and Market Sustainability 
(DREAMS) Project
The Development for Renewable Energy Applications Mainstreaming and Market Sustainability 
(DREAMS) is a five (5)-year (2017-2022) project being implemented by the DOE through funding 
support from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the United Nation Development Program 
(UNDP). The primary objective of the project is to promote and facilitate the commercialization of 
the renewable energy markets through the removal of barriers to increase investments in REbased power generation projects. It envisions to achieve a direct lifetime GHG emission reduction 
ASEP Rural Electrification and Energy Efficiency Activitiesof around 2,500 kiloton (kt) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), and indirect CO2e reduction 
ranging from 4,889 to 141,000 ktCO2e.
The project has the following four (4) major components:
▪ RE Policy, Planning and Financing. The expected output will lead to the enforcement of 
supportive policy and regulatory environment that will leverage increased investment in 
RE development and application at the local level. 
▪ Institutional Strengthening for RE Mainstreaming. The intent is to address the barriers 
associated with the need for improved capacity in the Philippines, mainly at the local level 
on RE issues and the development, operation and management of projects. The outcome 
is envisioned to strengthen institutional capacity that will lead to increased RE investment 
at the local level.
▪ ‘Capitalized’ RE Market Development. This component will address the barriers relating 
to the absence of a functional RE Market that represents tangible government measures 
to ensure compliance with the mandated utilization of RE generation and spur the 
growth of the RE industry. The RE projects in the RE Market are to fall within standards 
of the Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) that provide clarity on rules and regulations 
and qualify certain RE projects to be issued RE Certificates (RECs).
The outcome resulting from the outputs from this component will be a “capitalized” RE 
Market and an accompanying RE registrar that will contribute to an increased share of 
RE-based power capacity, and an increased number of RE project developers at the local 
level. 
▪ RE Commercialization. This component will address barriers related to lack of successful 
RE projects in the Philippines. The expected outcomes are:
o Increased confidence of local RE developers that leads to an enhanced uptake of RE 
projects at the local level; and 
o Increased number of RE projects using proven and emerging technologies, thus 
boosting successful replication. 
As of December 2019, DREAMS supported the development and passage of six (6) RE policies and 
guidelines and established the Philippine Renewable Energy Market System (PREMS) used by RE 
Registrar.
3. Building Low Emissions Alternatives to Develop Economic Resilience and Sustainability
(B-LEADERS)
The B-LEADERS project was implemented to strengthen the capacity of the government and key 
partners to plan, design, and implement low Emissions Development Strategies (LEDS). This 
project builds on the successful work of the United States Agency for International Development 
(USAID) - Climate Change and Clean Energy Project (CEnergy). Its goal is to further strengthen the 
competency of the government to undertake the LEDS contributing to the formulation of the 
Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) in the energy and transport sectors, and to a 
certain extent, the forestry/land use sector.To achieve this goal, the project was implemented under two (2) complementary tasks, namely:
▪ Conduct in-country capacity building on low emission development; and
▪ Increase investment in clean energy projects.
Aside from those mentioned above, the DOE also collaborated with other development partners, 
such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Korea 
International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale 
Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), United Kingdom (UK), other United Nations system, and Economic 
Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA). Also, the DOE supported the World Wildlife 
Fund (WWF) current project on the formulation of local energy plan and capacity building for 
Butuan City in Mindanao with focus on greater integration of renewable energy. 
The DOE will continuously explore collaboration with these development partners during the 
planning period to advance the implementation of policies, programs and projects of each energy 
sub sector as contained in this Plan Update.
B. STRATEGIES TO PUSH FOR NATIONAL INTEREST IN INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY
1. Participating in the Major Regional Groupings
The Philippines recognizes the opportunities from bilateral and multilateral cooperation 
agreements in advancing the national agenda in global economic community. As such, the DOE 
has been involved in various bilateral and regional/multilateral energy cooperation, among which 
are: (a) Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN); (b) Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation 
(APEC); (c) East Asia Summit (EAS); (d) Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth 
Area (BIMP-EAGA), (e) United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC); (f) 
Economic Partnership and Free Trade Agreements; and, (g) other bilateral and regional energyrelated undertakings.
These cooperation agreements serve as platform for significant discourses on collaborative 
efforts, policy issues and concerns that effect both regional and national growth.
Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)
In ASEAN, energy 
cooperation is carried 
out through the 
implementation of the 
ASEAN Plan of Action on 
Energy Cooperation 
(APAEC) 2016-2025 with 
Phase I (2016-2020)
already nears 
completion, which 
adopted a theme 
“Enhancing Energy 
Connectivity and Market 
Integration in ASEAN to 
Achieve Energy Security, Accessibility, Affordability and Sustainability for All.” 
During the 37th ASEAN Ministers on Energy Meeting held on 2-6 September 2019 in Bangkok, ThailandThe formulation of the APAEC Phase II covering the period 2021-2025 (a continuation of Phase I) is 
ongoing with a sub-theme “Accelerating Energy Transition and Strengthening Resilience through 
Greater Innovation and Cooperation.” The final draft shall be presented at the 38th Senior Officials 
Meeting on Energy (SOME) on 24-28 August 2020, and for endorsement/adoption by the 38th 
ASEAN Ministers on Energy Meeting (AMEM) on 02-06 November 2020. 
The APAEC Phase II serves as the blueprint for transition of the ASEAN region’s energy landscape 
to a more sustainable future with higher aspirational targets and new initiatives. The Phase II takes 
into account the recent global economic and energy trends including emerging technologies, and 
integrates the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and the Paris Agreement. It sets a more 
aggressive energy intensity reduction of around 32.0–35.0 percent154 by 2025 (based on 2005 
levels), and 23.0 percent155 RE share in the total primary energy supply (TPES) and 35.0 percent RE 
share in the ASEAN installed power capacity by 2025. The outcome-based strategies and action 
plans to achieving these targets are incorporated in the APAEC Phase II with identified mechanisms 
to mobilize private sector investment. The 6th ASEAN Energy Outlook (AEO6) provides the 
complementary modelling and forecasting analyses needed as bases for the strategies, outcomes 
and targets of the Phase II.
The APAEC covers seven (7) program156 areas with each has its own outcome-based strategies and 
action plans. These program areas are:
a. ASEAN Power Grid (APG); 
b. Trans-ASEAN Gas Pipeline (TAPG); 
c. Coal and Clean Coal Technology; 
d. Energy Efficiency & Conservation; 
e. Renewable Energy; 
f. Regional Energy and Policy Planning; and, 
g. Civilian Nuclear Energy.
With the assistance of various development partners and international organizations, notable 
milestones have been accomplished in the APAEC program areas towards greater energy security, 
integration of regional energy infrastructures and creating responsive polices in the context of 
sustainable development. 
▪ The APG focuses on advancing multilateral power trade that supports the goal of the ASEAN 
Economic Community (AEC) 2025 through enhanced connectivity, greater energy security and 
sustainability. The Heads of ASEAN Power Utilities and Authorities (HAPUA), a Specialized 
Body, leads the APG in collaboration with the ASEAN Energy Regulators Network (AERN)157 and 
other ASEAN energy bodies. A total of 25 GWh of electricity was traded under Phase I through 
the first multilateral power trade project, the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power 
Integration Project (LTMS-PIP). The APG has 16 interconnection projects including the 
Philippines. Under Phase II, HAPUA has conduct feasibility studies of the remaining eight (8) 
APG projects. 
▪ The TAPG is being implemented by the ASEAN Council on Petroleum (ASCOPE), also a 
Specialized Body, consisting of heads of national oil and gas companies of the ASEAN Member 
States (AMS), with the objective of ensuring greater security of natural gas supply in the region, 
and developing policy and regulatory framework to progress the TAPG project. The project 
154 In Phase I, the aspirational target of 20.0 percent energy intensity reduction by 2020 (based on 2005 levels) was achieved at 24.4 percent. 
155 Adopted the same RE target in Phase I. The target excludes traditional biomass.
156 Except for APG and TAGP, which are being led by Specialized Bodies, each Program Area has its Sub sector Network. 
157 Consists of energy regulators from the AMShas a cross-border natural gas infrastructure connecting six AMS through 13 pipelines with total 
length of 3,631 kilometers (kms) and eight LNG regasification terminals (RGT) with combined 
total capacity of 37.85 million tons per annum (MTPA). To increase utilization of natural gas as 
an alternative fuel, ASCOPE is tasked to implement the recommendations of the study on SmallScale LNG and LNG Bunkering. Continuing activity will include the development of technical 
database that covers gas infrastructure such as gas pipelines, gas processing plants, LNG 
liquefaction and RGT terminals. 
▪ The Coal and Clean Coal Technology program area is focused on the promotion, dissemination 
and deployment of the clean coal technologies (CCT) to enhance environmental sustainability. 
The ASEAN Forum on Coal (AFOC) takes the lead in this program area. Japan, as key partner 
provides support for capacity building activities focusing on CCT, carbon capture and storage, 
upgrading of low rank coal as well as the conduct of studies. Future strategic work will be on 
influencing and engaging the use of coal to power up requirements of countries while 
addressing environmental challenges. 
▪ Recognizing the most cost-effective way of enhancing energy security, addressing climate 
change and promoting competitiveness, the adoption of energy efficiency and conservation 
(EE&C) measures reduced the regional energy intensity to a level surpassing the 2020 target
(under Phase I). In achieving a higher target of 32.0-35.0 percent energy intensity reduction, 
action plans cover pursuing market transformation, harmonization of the Minimum Energy 
Performance Standards (MEPS) for electrical and electronic equipment (e.g., motors, 
transformers and fans), Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) on testing methods of energy 
efficiency standards, and financing mechanism design for projects. 
▪ In pursuit of the aspirational target of increasing the share of renewables in the ASEAN energy 
mix, the AMS have been improving their respective policies and targets to align with the 
regional target on RE. Among the action plans and strategies to meet the regional targets 
include: (a) deployment of large-scale RE systems; (b) expansion of shares of RE in APG; (c) 
promotion of smart grids, decentralized and distributed RE systems; and, (d) exploration of 
waste-to-energy and RE-based hydrogen, among others. 
▪ Aside from closely monitoring the implementation of the different APAEC program areas, the 
Regional Energy and Policy Planning program area works to better profile the ASEAN energy 
sector internationally through annual publications on ASEAN energy cooperation. Part of its 
deliverables are the periodic publication of the ASEAN Energy Outlook, Energy Statistics, Policy 
Review and Analysis, and issues related to energy and climate change, prices and emerging 
technologies. 
▪ In line with the strategic goal of the Civilian Nuclear Energy program area to build capabilities in 
policy, technology and regulatory aspects, the Philippines, as the chair of the Nuclear Energy 
Cooperation Sub sector Network, organized and hosted a capacity building seminar on Regional 
Cooperation on Nuclear Security and study visit at the Philippine Nuclear Research Institute 
back-to-back with the annual meeting of the Network in Manila on 20-23 May 2019. The Network 
will focus its next activities on public acceptance of nuclear energy by developing a public 
acceptance strategy, as well as conduct of perception survey and sharing of experience on 
public engagement. Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
APEC is a regional economic forum established in 1989 to leverage the growing interdependence 
of the Asia-Pacific. It envisions to ensure that goods, services, investment and people move easily 
across borders. It operates as a cooperative, multilateral economic and trade forum. Member 
economies participate on the basis of open dialogue with utmost respect to the views of all 
participating economies. All economies have an equal say and decision-making is reached by 
consensus. However, unlike in ASEAN, there are no binding commitments or treaty obligations 
required. Commitments are undertaken on a voluntary basis and capacity building projects help 
members implement the APEC initiatives.
APEC's structure is based on both a "bottom-up" and "top-down" approach. Four core committees 
and their respective working groups provide strategic policy recommendations to APEC Leaders 
and Ministers who annually set the vision for overarching goals and initiatives. The working groups 
are then tasked to implement these initiatives through a variety of APEC-funded projects. The 
Energy Working Group (EWG) is one of most important Working Groups established a year after 
APEC was created in 1989.
The EWG is a voluntary, regionally-based forum operating under the APEC umbrella with 
participation by all 21 APEC member economies. Launched in 1990, the EWG meets formally twice 
a year to discuss developments and progress on energy policy issues, helping further APEC goals 
to facilitate energy-related-trade and investment, and seeks to maximize the energy sector’s 
contribution to the region’s economic and social well-being, while mitigating the environmental 
effects of energy supply and use.
The Energy Working Group 
The EWG is composed of policy officials and technical experts from APEC member economies who 
work with experts in other APEC fora, academia, private industry, and regional and international 
organizations to build capacity aimed at:
▪ Strengthening regional and domestic energy security and resilience across the region;
▪ Lowering the carbon intensity of energy supply and use;
▪ Promoting the diversification of fuels and sources; and
▪ Training a gender-inclusive energy workforce.
The EWG’s work incorporates guidance from APEC Economic Leaders, Ministers and Energy 
Ministers to form a solid foundation for APEC energy cooperation, including:
▪ Work towards the APEC aspirational target of reducing aggregate energy intensity by 45.0
percent from 2005 levels by 2035 through collaboration on analysis of available energy 
efficient technologies, energy efficiency standard harmonization and peer review on energy 
efficiency;
▪ Thrive towards achieving the APEC aspirational target on “doubling the share of renewables 
in the region’s energy mix,
158
 including in power generation,” from 2010 levels by 2030; 
▪ Make further progress toward rationalizing and phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, 
while providing energy access to those in need;
▪ Work towards improving resiliency of energy infrastructure to natural disasters and climate 
change within the region through “APEC Initiative for Enhancing the Quality of Electric Power 
Infrastructure,” and conducting vulnerability assessment on energy infrastructure;
158 Excluding traditional biomass▪ Support community-based low carbon development in the region through the APEC LowCarbon Model Town Project, APEC Energy Smart Community Initiative Knowledge Sharing 
Platform, and APEC Cooperation Initiative for Jointly Establishing an Asia-Pacific 
Urbanization Partnership;
▪ Implement Oil and Gas Security Initiative to address the challenges faced and to improve 
security exercises, as well as create favorable conditions for trade and investments to 
support a diversified, flexible, and integrated natural gas market in the APEC region through 
“APEC Regional LNG Trade Facilitation Initiative;”
▪ Implement “APEC Green Energy Finance Initiative” to ensure financial sustainability of green 
energy development in the region; and,
▪ Strengthen cross-fora collaboration and public private partnership on APEC energy issues. 
Significant agenda items are discussed in EWGs, among them are the short- and long-term 
measures to implement the Energy Security Initiative (ESI), which is based on the directive set 
by the APEC Energy Ministers. 
The APEC Energy Ministers’ Meetings (EMMs) provide the EWG with political guidance and 
directions regarding the development and implementation of key priorities, initiatives and 
future work programs. The EMM also provides an opportunity for the EWG to report and 
receive feedback on the progress of ongoing work programs, and enable Energy Ministers to 
share dialogue on key energy issues with each other, with EWG members and with the APEC 
business community through the EWG Business Network.
Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East Asia Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) 
The BIMP-EAGA initiative was established in 1994 by the four countries as a shared strategy to 
accelerate socio-economic development of the less developed and geographically remote areas in 
the member countries. From its inception, the cooperation program adopted a public-private 
approach to development with private sector serving as the engine of growth and the public sector 
taking an enabling role. 
The BIMP-EAGA covers the entire sultanate of Brunei Darussalam; the provinces in Kalimantan, 
Sulawesi, Maluku and Papua in Indonesia; the states of Sabah and Sarawak and the federal territory 
of Labuan in Malaysia; and the entire island of Mindanao and the island province of Palawan in the 
Philippines. 
The BIMP-EAGA Power and Energy Infrastructure Cluster (PEIC) formulated a nine (9)-year 
Roadmap (2017-2025) to promote the optimal use of sub-regional energy resources to expand 
energy access especially in rural areas, and optimize the use of domestic energy resources. The 
PEIC likewise intends to improve regional energy security for the different sub sectors, such as 
power interconnection, renewables, rural electrification, and sub-regional energy efficiency and 
conservation (EE&C) rolling pipeline projects as included in the final BIMP-EAGA Vision 2017-2025 
(BEV2025). 
The PEIC aims to achieve a resilient and improved energy sector for sustainable development with 
reliable and stable power supply, and enhanced electrification in the respective member countries. 
In order to achieve this, the Cluster need to come up with enclave power connection (in-country) 
or interconnection (two or more countries involve) projects coupled with renewable projects, and 
energy efficiency and conservation programs within the sub-region. This initiative resulted in a 
proposal of the BIMP-EAGA Senior Officials to request the ADB for the conduct of a pre-feasibility study on East Kalimantan, Borneo-Mindanao Power Interconnection in February 2014 in response 
to the power supply shortage in Mindanao. 
In observance of the ASEAN tradition of rotating the hosting of events among its member states, 
the Philippines hosted the 6th Annual Meeting of the PEIC back-to-back with the Capacity Building 
on Biomass in July 2018. One of the significant milestone achievements of the Philippine 
Chairmanship is the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding involving two Electric 
Cooperatives (MORESCO II and ZAMSURECO II) from the Mindanao region and a private company
(T.S. Renewable Energy Solutions PTE Ltd) from Singapore in the development and commercial 
operation of Biomass distribution facility in Mindanao.
Trade-related Undertakings / Agreements
The Philippines is a signatory to the World Trade Organization (WTO) – General Agreement on 
Tariff and Trade (GATT) and General Agreement on Trade and Services (GATS). With this, the 
country is committed to negotiate and conclude bilateral, regional and multilateral Free Trade 
Areas/Regional Trade Areas (FTAs/RTAs). Liberalization and market integration is a global trend 
which developing countries like the Philippines should proactively participate.
The DOE has been part of the Philippine negotiating team in different multilateral and bilateral fora
primarily to safeguard and make the local energy industry (goods and services) more competitive 
with what the others are offering, as well as capitalize on available resources and investment 
opportunities. These agreements are very comprehensive in nature covering negotiations on
trade in goods and services, economic cooperation, investments, dispute settlements, among 
others. The foreseen economic returns from these agreements shall contribute to economic 
growth and energy security for the country. 
To date, the DOE is engaged in FTAs/RTAs under the WTO, ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (AFTA)
(now called ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement or ATIGA) and ASEAN Framework Agreement on 
Services (AFAS). Other bilateral FTAs and RTAs include the Philippines-Japan Economic 
Partnership Agreement, Philippine-European Free Trade Association (EFTA), Philippine-European 
Commission Economic Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, ASEAN-Australia and New 
Zealand, ASEAN-China, ASEAN-European, ASEAN-Hong Kong, ASEAN-India, ASEAN-Japan, ASEANKorea, ASEAN-Canada, ASEAN-United States, and the Regional Comprehensive Economic 
Partnership (RCEP) Agreement.
Upcoming bilateral FTAs/RTAs initial scoping have also begun 
▪ Philippines-EU FTA;
▪ Philippines-Australia FTA;
▪ Philippines-Taiwan Joint Economic Cooperation (PTJEC);
▪ Philippines-Russia Joint Committee on Trade and Economic Cooperation (JCTEC);
▪ Philippines-US Bilateral Strategic Dialogue (BSD);
▪ PH-US Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA);
▪ Investment and Industry Dialogue (PATIID) under the APEC Committee on Trade and 
Investment;
▪ Free Trade Area of Asia Pacific (FTAAP) under APEC; and,
▪ Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and Conference of Party (COP)
As energy is one of the major contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the sector is 
directly involved on issues about climate change. The DOE represents the energy sector in 
providing technical and expert views on what climate change mitigation pathways and adaptation 
strategies the country needs to take.
The COP is the "Supreme Body" of the UNFCCC, the highest decision-making authority. It is an 
association of all the countries that are Parties to the Convention. The COP is responsible for 
keeping international efforts to address climate change on track. It reviews the implementation 
of the UNFCCC and examines the commitments of Parties in light of the Convention’s objective, 
new scientific findings and experiences gained in implementing climate change policies. A key task 
for the COP is to review the progress made by Parties as reported in their submitted national 
communications and GHG emission inventories.
The Philippines, along with the other 194 UN member nations, signed the historic Paris Agreement 
during France’s hosting of COP in December 2015. The universal agreement’s main aim is to keep 
a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius and to drive efforts to limit the 
temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Following the 
Agreement, the next step is for the country to develop its first Nationally Determined 
Contributions (NDC) building from its submitted Intended Nationally Determined Contributions 
(INDC) to the UNFCCC.
2. Sharing of best practices in international fora
The DOE continues to gather best practices from other countries through the international fora. 
Policies and programs are normally shared during energy fora, seminars and meetings for 
participating countries’ appreciation and possible duplication or adoption. A classic example is the 
Policy Dialogue Agenda during EWG meetings where each country presents its current policies, 
laws and regulations. Likewise, there is also the Notable Energy Development Agenda in EWG 
where member economies present the most recent notable energy development in their 
respective countries. 
The DOE may always replicate initiatives from other countries and tailor fit based on the domestic 
situation and requirements. On the other hand, confidential documents may be requested from 
the reporting country through diplomatic channels or through Foreign Affairs’ Ministries. 
Diplomatic or study mission may be undertaken to formally request and solicit detailed 
information.
3. Forging International Agreements with Other Countries and International Organizations
International agreements like Memorandum of Agreement or Understanding (MOA/MOU), Letter 
of Intent (LOI), among others, are forged to bind both parties on its obligations and responsibilities 
as agreed and stipulated in the agreement. The general intent is to undertake collaborative 
projects and programs that would be beneficial for both countries or organizations. Normally, 
exchange of drafts is done through diplomatic channel.
The DOE has a compendium of international agreements that are regularly monitored. Some of 
these agreements are active with numerous ongoing activities, but some remain dormant with a 
shorter cooperation period, usually three years. These agreements shall be revisited and prioritized to fill gaps in attaining the targets and overall goals of the energy sub sectors in this 
Plan Update. 
An ideal agreement is done with countries with diplomatic ties. Otherwise, disputes and 
disagreements would be difficult to settle amicably by both parties. As such, the DOE shall ensure 
that the country being dealt with has the competency in terms of resources and technology, 
coupled with good bilateral record and engagement, and has value added to the energy sector or 
to other sectors of the government.
4. Seeking Funding Assistance from External Sources
The DOE will explore funding from various sources to finance important projects and undertakings. 
The sources may come from development partners (e.g., World Bank, ADB, UN-system, JICA, 
KOICA, USAID), and the available funds from ASEAN and APEC.
The development partners normally have priority thrusts in funding programs and projects. The 
DOE presents energy programs and projects requiring funding support in a Donors’ Forum or the 
Development Partners Forum. During the forum, prepared concept notes are presented and 
matching is done based on the thrusts of the development partners. The DOE prioritizes the 
proposals to be offered to willing donors. 
The DOE has also been exploring funding from APEC and ASEAN that usually course through call 
for proposals of the ASEAN the Sub sector Networks, the EWG Experts Groups and ASEAN/APEC 
Secretariat. The DOE shall implement firmer schedule on call for proposals from all possible 
funding sources to increase and improve batting average of approval. 
5. Addressing Emerging Issues at the Regional and International Level
One of the recent and major concerns globally is the energy sector’s resiliency from unexpected 
natural and man-made calamities that would affect continuous supply of energy (e.g. pandemic, 
market and climate). 
As Co-Chair of the APEC Energy Resiliency Task Force (ERTF) together with the US Department of 
Energy, the 10th Meeting of the APEC ERTF was recently convened virtually on 25 August 2020 at 
the margin of the 59th Meeting of the APEC EWG (EWG59). Best practices of APEC-member 
economies were presented and future collaboration under the current situation were tabled for 
discussion. Update report of activities of the Workstreams on Grid Resilience, Strengthening 
Infrastructure, Energy Water-Nexus and Energy Access were presented.
During the Policy Dialogue Agenda of the EWG59, economies were requested to share their 
policies on the topic “Renewable Energy Transition for Sustainable Growth.” All economies were 
requested to submit to EWG Secretariat their respective contributions or written reports to the 
said thematic agenda discussion.ANNEXES

Annex 28. Potential Small Island InterconnectionsAnnex 1. METHODOLOGY USED FOR THE ENERGY OUTLOOK 2018-2040
In formulating the Energy Outlook, various energy modeling methodologies and tools were used 
to come up with energy demand and supply projections for the 2018-2040 period. 
Final energy consumption was projected using (a) Simple Econometric Simulation System, 
Expanded (Simple E2, version 14), an add-in application in Microsoft Excel developed by the 
Institute of Energy Economics, Japan (IEEJ); and (b) transport energy demand model developed
by the Economic Consulting Associates (ECA)86, with data support from the DOE87. To further 
improve the energy demand forecasts, sectoral roadmaps including relevant factors and 
information that impact the energy consumption by sector were considered in the simulation, 
specifically:
▪ Demand levels for Transport, the most energy-intensive sector, were derived separately for 
each of the four (4) modes of transportation – road, rail, air and water. For road transport, the 
number of vehicles was modeled as a function of GDP, while estimation of vehicle fleet made 
use of the Winfrey Survival Model combined with average passenger and vehicle-kilometer 
traveled and fuel economy to derive energy consumption. The model for rail transport utilized 
the number of passengers for the Philippine National Railways (PNR) and Metro Rail 
Transit/Light Rail Transit (MRT/LRT) lines and urban population as indicators. On the other 
hand, the indicators for water and air transport include the number of passengers, 
kilometer/ton-kilometer flown, cargo throughput and sub-sectoral value-added. The Outlook 
also incorporated expansion plans and new projects/programs of the Department of 
Transportation (DOTr) with the development in other related sectors, notably local tourism. 
▪ The Industry sector’s aggregate demand was divided into energy-intensive and less-energy 
intensive industries. The energy-intensive industries cover food processing, sugar, paper and 
pulp industries, cement manufacturing, chemicals, basic metal and machinery and equipment. 
Meanwhile, other manufacturing activities, mining and construction fall under less-energy 
intensive industries. Other variables used as indicators were gross value added (GVA), 
commodity prices, production targets and population were used as indicators for the energy 
demand model of these sub-sectors. Sectoral roadmaps were likewise considered in modeling 
energy consumption.
▪ For the Residential sector, socio-economic indicators, such as household final consumption 
expenditure (HFCE) and household population, were considered in projecting energy 
consumption. Both data were sourced from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). Also, the 
results of the 2011 Household Energy Consumption Survey (HECS) were used extensively in the 
projection of the sector’s energy consumption, particularly in determining the level of biomass 
demand. 
▪ For Commercial and Agriculture sectors, GVA for trade and services, and agriculture, fishery 
and forestry (AFF) were utilized, respectively. 
On the other hand, the baseline data for power demand was obtained from the Monthly 
Operations Report (MOR) of the distribution utilities (DUs) and power delivery and energy 
exchange data of the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP). Supplemental data was 
likewise taken from the Distribution Development Plan 2019-2028 and Non-Utility Forecast of the 
NGCP for 2019-2040. From these data sets, electricity purchased was projected based on the ratio 
86 Led by Prof. Ronwaldo del Mundo of the University of the Philippines’ (UP) College of Engineering
87 Through the Energy Policy and Planning Bureauof historical electricity demand growth rates vis-à-vis GDP growth (elasticity). From here, power 
demand was derived using the load factor (LF) approach, with around 70 percent LF for the total 
Philippines. To come up with the gross generation, the power plant's own-use and transmission 
losses (TL) were applied to gross up the electricity purchased forecast. Electricity generation and 
sales forecast and the final energy consumption projections were consolidated into the Longrange Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP) software to come up with the overall Energy 
Outlook. LEAP is a widely used software tool for energy policy analysis and climate change 
mitigation assessment developed at the Stockholm Environment Institute. Annex 2. TOTAL FINAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION, By Sector, Reference Scenario (in Million Tons of Oil Equivalent, MTOE)

 Renewable Energy (RE) Targets vis-à-vis Total Energy Supply
The level of RE generation from RPS is supported by 27,325 MW of RE capacity by 2040. This would 
mean that RPS alone can supply the needed capacity to meet the NREP target of an additional 20,000 
MW RE capacity by 2040 from the 2018 level of 7,226 MW. However, RPS-based capacity is still lower 
compared to that of the Reference and CES. This would mean that other RE policy mechanisms 
have the potential to push RE capacity further beyond the RPS level – as can be seen in the 
Reference and CES. (Figure A.1)
The RE transition in 2019 brings the RE generation level r to reach 89.1 TWh by 2040 from 3.9 TWh
in 2020 – representing a 16.9 percent average annual rate of increase across the planning period. 
This also represents 22.6 percent of the projected 394.5 TWh total generation of all technologies 
by 2040. As can be seen in Figure A.2.2, RPS generation output already represents a significant 
chunk of the aggregate RE under both Reference (85.8 percent share) and CES (73.7 percent 
share). Under these two (2) scenarios, the projected RE share to total generation by 2040 is 26.3 
percent and 37.2 percent, respectively. During the first decade, Figure 2.2 shows some episodes 
that RE generation is lower than the Reference due to lower demand for electricity vis-a-vis peak 
demand as an impact of the energy efficiency measures in the power sector. Variable REs or VREs 
such as solar which has a big chunk in the capacity mix of RE in CES gives way for oil-based power 
plants during peak demand to balance the reliability of the grid. Generation from oil-based power 
plants accounts for only 3% of the mix throughout the planning horizon.
