Increasing calls to mobilize all efforts to ensure inclusive 
growth for the country has been clear and resounding for 
the past years. The energy sector, being the driver of 
sustainable development, will have to be guided by a Plan 
that is clear and precise in identifying specific action plans 
and programs to ensure security of supply, expand access 
to all forms of energy, improve efficiency of use and 
promote clean energy resources and technologies. It is in 
this context that the Philippine Energy Plan 2016-2030 was 
formulated, taking full consideration of the Department’s 
8-point Energy Sector Agenda, as well as the President 
Duterte’s 10-point Socio-Economic Agenda. 
Central to this Plan is the formulation of comprehensive 
sectoral roadmaps to make sure that the energy agenda 
will be implemented on time to meet the needs of our consumers. This Plan also provides more 
emphasis and focus on sustainability of all available energy sources, as well as the diversification of 
our energy mix to make sure that we are not heavily reliant on one major fuel only. 
We believe that a transformation in the way we produce and consume energy is an urgent matter at 
hand. At present, it is simply not enough to ensure that our energy demands are met. We need to 
prioritize the fuels and technologies that will give the country a future in terms of sustainable energy 
and environmental protection as part of our moral obligation to the generations to come. 
To make all this possible, we will work on the development of policy intervention, implementation of 
capability building endeavors and encouragement of vital investments. For a start, we need to 
develop comprehensive programs on alternative fuels/technologies, energy efficiency and 
conservation and renewable energy. The low-carbon future vision of this Plan anticipates the 
increased share of clean energy sources (RE and natural gas) in the energy mix, as well as the 
increased blending of biofuels for the transport sector. We also need to ensure an environment that 
is conducive to securing capital investments as energy infrastructure remains to be one of the 
country’s largest capital cost program. The timely completion of additional capacity requirements 
must also be ensured to address the growing energy demand of the country. 
Energy efficiency and conservation is another core strategy on energy sustainability as well as the 
adoption of smart technology. Along this line, we will develop smart energy consumers, helping 
them to be more aware of how to effectively manage their energy use, not only to save on finances 
but to reduce harmful emissions. Furthermore, the Department is also into the formulation of an optimal energy mix that is 
technology neutral with the aim of reducing the country’s dependence on one major 
fuel/technology only. Thereby, the mix will be designed based on power requirements of the 
country in terms of its baseload, mid-merit and peaking capacity needs. This is also expected to give 
energy players and investors the opportunity of developing emerging energy technologies/fuels such 
as nuclear power generation. 
Taking all these together, we know that these enormous tasks could not be shouldered by 
government alone. We will definitely need the support of our energy stakeholders in the country, as 
well as our international and development partners. 
The challenges we face are definitely enormous, but we will look more on the opportunities that lay 
ahead. Thus, this Plan will provide us a comprehensive documentation of specific strategic directions 
and action plans to guide the sector during the planning period 2016-2030. 
We now live in a globally competitive world and we could not afford to be complacent. Let us all be 
in this together. Mabuhay!

Introduction 
As energy is vital to quality human life and the country’s economic growth, the Department of Energy 
(DOE) initiated the formulation of the 2016-2030 sectoral energy roadmaps that will set out specific 
actions and directions to drive the sector forward. Development of these roadmaps took into 
consideration the country’s long-term economic growth forecast, wealth of indigenous and natural 
resources, energy security and reliability goals, as well as measured respond to impacts of climate 
change. 
These roadmaps cover collective efforts of the energy industry in exploring and harnessing all available 
energy sources in the country. The critical role of both renewable and conventional energy resources will 
continue to be reinforced as both resources will help mitigate increases in energy demand. Policies will 
also be in place to ensure that legitimate public concerns on environmental and social impact in the 
course of developing these resources are addressed. 
Promoting energy access is the sector’s contribution to poverty alleviation and people empowerment. 
Thus, the Electrification Roadmap will ensure 100 percent household access to electricity services by 
2020. This would empower local communities and boost countryside economic activities. 
Initiatives on demand-side management and energy efficiency measures are considered prime areas of 
focus to temper the country’s energy requirements. 
Each of the roadmaps is cognizant of the critical need to acquire and sustain substantial investments to 
ensure that energy projects are actualized in a timely manner. 
And to further support the growing industrialization of the Philippines, the Department is in the process 
of formulating a responsive and dynamic energy mix, as well as establishing the local reserve 
requirements. Said mix is being developed to be technology neutral and will instead identify power 
requirement based on plant categorization. Based on the new energy mix policy for power generation, 
the power plant technologies considered per type of operation are as follows: 
• 70 percent baseload capacity from coal, geothermal, big hydropower, natural gas, nuclear 
and biomass (during availability of feedstocks) 
• 20 percent mid-merit capacities from natural gas 
• 10 percent of peaking capacities from oil-based plants and variable renewable energy such 
as solar photovoltaic (during daytime) and wind 
Once it is firmed-up, the optimal energy mix policy will provide a clear direction for energy 
developers/investors to plan ahead with its business plans. Said policy can be best applied to island 
electrification in their power development planning and will provide energy planners and policy makers 
the platform for exploring the possibility of going nuclear. Likewise, for the energy sector, this policy is 
expected to address pressing issues such as the high cost of electricity, sporadic power interruptions, 
limited and unreliable transmission system, delayed and unpredictable permitting process in the 
application for power projects, limited power electricity market and electrification gaps in off-grid areas. ENERGY DEMAND-SUPPLY OUTLOOK 
2016-2030
Key Assumptions, Parameters and Methodologies 
The energy projection for Philippine Energy Outlook 2016-2030 considered the targets and 
assumptions (Table 1) of the energy sector in promoting the use of environmental friendly and 
benign energy sources and efficient end-use technologies. This is to be able to reflect to the 
projected end-use demand pattern the impact of the energy sector’s programs and projects which 
are being implemented to support energy related policy programs of the government. Specifically, 
the demand projection takes into account new and existing policy programs and measures within 
the energy sector which are currently being implemented and will be pursued within the timeframe 
of the Plan. On the other hand, model building for energy supply requirements which are driven by 
projected demand established two (2) scenarios for 2016-2030 Outlook. The first scenario, the 
Business as Usual Scenario (BAU), simulates how the future supply of energy will evolve without 
further government policy intervention and as the most likely to happen scenario. The second one 
considers the impact of aggressive implementation of the plans, programs and policies of the 
government under the Clean Energy Scenario (CES), specifically the achievement of at least 30% 
share of RE in the total capacity mix for power generation until 2030 as indicated under Department 
Circular No. 2015-07-00141
 and significant increase of natural gas utilization in power generation 
until the end of the planning period. 
Consistent with the global call to combat and/or reduce the effects of climate change while 
supporting economic growth and development, the Plan adheres to commitment of international 
energy intensity reduction particularly, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation’s (APEC) target to 
reduce aggregate energy intensity (energy demand per unit of gross domestic product - GDP) of 
APEC economies by 25 percent in 2030 to 45 percent by 2035 with 2005 as the base year period. In 
addition, this Outlook has also incorporated the goal of doubling the share of renewables in the 
APEC energy mix, including power generation, from its 2010 levels by 2030. 
The base year used for the projections is 2015, and supply and demand targets/parameters are 
summarized in the table below: 
Table 1. SUPPLY AND DEMAND TARGETS FOR 2016-2030 ENERGY OUTLOOK
o Existing, committed, indicative and potential power projects + 30 percent share of RE in the 
capacity mix; and higher natural gas share in power generation mix by 2030
o Energy savings on all sectors for electricity and petroleum products of at least 6 percent 
yearly from 2016 to 2030
o Increased utilization of alternative fuels for transport (CNG and electricity) from 2016-2030
o 10 percent biodiesel blend for 2030; 20 percent bioethanol blend for 2030

DC 2015-07-0014: Guidelines for the Policy of Maintaining the Share of RE in the CountryThe following are the general assumptions on the trends of major factors affecting the demand for 
various energy products:
Economic Growth 
The average annual growth rate of the country’s real GDP for the last decade (2005-2015) is 5.4 
percent, with industry2
 and services3, both energy-intensive sectors, as main drivers of economic 
growth. On the other hand, energy consumption in industry and services sectors increased, on the 
average, by 3.1 percent and 6.2 percent, respectively, for the past ten (10) years4
. 
As the country’s economy is expected to benefit from strong macro- and micro- economic 
fundamentals, official government figures5
 project real GDP to increase between 7 to 8 percent per 
year from 2016 to 2018, and by 8 percent per annum until 2030. 
Population 
The Outlook assumes that population shall increase from 100 million persons in 2014 to 134 million 
persons in 2040, equivalent to a yearly 1.9 percent increase. This is consistent with the population 
targets set forth in the country’s commitment to the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions 
(INDC). 
Oil Prices 
Crude oil price assumptions in the Outlook are based on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries (OPEC) average crude import price, a proxy for international oil prices, in its World Oil 
Outlook (WOO) 2015-2040. It is assumed to increase from US$51/barrel in 20156
 to around 
US$80/barrel in 2020 to US$123/barrel by 2030. 
Sectoral Energy Demand Methodologies 
The energy demand outlook for this planning period considers a wide range of issues and trends that 
could have major implications in the country’s energy consumption patterns. Demand-side fuel 
roadmaps as submitted by respective units/bureaus within the DOE, as well as relevant factors and 
information that impact on the energy consumption for each sector were considered in the 
simulation, specifically: 
 Demand levels for Transport, which is the most energy-intensive sector. The demand levels 
were derived separately for each of the four (4) modes of transportation – road, rail, air and 
water. For road transport, related indicators used as independent variables to project the 
demand include number of vehicles per type of fuel use, fuel efficiency and mileage, fuel 
conversion, and gross value added (GVA). Energy demand projection for rail transport used

Actual 2015 FY price, DOE-Oil Industry Management Bureaunumber of passengers for the Philippine National Railways (PNR) and Metro Rail 
Transit/Light Rail Transit (MRT/LRT) lines and population. On the other hand, for water and 
air transport, indicators such as number of passengers, kilometer/ton-kilometer flown, cargo 
throughput and sub-sectoral value-added were used in energy demand projection. In 
general, the Outlook also incorporates future plans and programs of the Department of 
Transportation (DOTr), with the foreseen development in other related sectors, notably local 
tourism. 
 The Industry sector’s aggregate demand was divided into energy intensive and less-energy 
intensive industries. Included under the energy intensive industries are food processing, 
sugar, paper and pulp industries, cement manufacturing, chemicals, basic metal and 
machinery and equipment. Meanwhile, other manufacturing activity, mining and 
construction fall under less-energy intensive industries. Variables such as GVA, commodity 
prices, production targets and population were used as indicators for energy demand model 
of these sub-sectors. 
 For the Residential sector, socio-economic indicators such as household final consumption 
expenditure (HFCE) and household population were considered in projecting energy 
consumption. Both data were sourced from the National Statistics Office (NSO). In addition, 
the results of the 2011 Household Energy Consumption Survey (HECS) were used extensively 
in the projection of the sector’s energy consumption, particularly in determining the level of 
biomass demand. 
 For Commercial and Agriculture sectors, GVA for trade and services, and agriculture, fishery 
and forestry were used, respectively. 
Final Energy Demand Outlook 2015 – 2030 
Total Final Energy Consumption
The country’s total final energy 
consumption (TFEC) is 
expected to increase at an 
average rate of 4.2 percent 
annually, from 29.8 million 
tons of oil equivalent (MTOE) in 
2015 to 54.9 MTOE in 2030 
(Figure 1). 
Although the transport sector’s 
energy demand will be tapered 
down with the penetration of 
more efficient fuels, it will 
remain as the biggest energy 
consuming sector with a 35.6 Figure 1: TOTAL FINAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION, BY SECTOR (2000-2030)percent average share across the entire planning horizon, and accounting for the bulk of the 
increase (38.1 percent) in TFEC levels between 2015 and 2030. The industry sector will exceed the 
level of residential sector demand as a second largest energy consumer in the near future, as the 
former puts in 26.6 percent share while the latter contributes an average of 24.8 percent share to 
the TFEC. The commercial sector, as the major drivers of the country’s economic growth in the next 
15 years, will hold an average share of 11.9 percent. On the other hand, agriculture (including fishery 
and forestry - AFF) sector will remain to be the least energy user with 1.1 percent average share of 
the total energy demand (Figure 2). 
Energy use in the industry 
sector will grow most rapidly 
at 5.7 percent annually, 
spurred by the foreseen 
increase in industrial output 
backed by the resurgence of 
the manufacturing sector. 
The commercial and transport 
sectors will post yearly 
increases of 4.7 percent and 
4.4 percent, respectively. The 
AFF sector, despite its meager 
share to TFEC, will utilize 
energy at a rate of 2.7 percent 
per year, while household energy will grow steadily by 2.0 percent per year between 2015 and 2030. 
Petroleum products will continue to account for the bulk of TFEC, with an average share of 45.8 
percent in the demand 
mix (Figure 3). With the 
easing of oil prices in 
the international 
market, demand for 
petroleum products will 
increase by an average 
of 3.9 percent per year 
from 2015 to 2030. 
Diesel and gasoline will 
continue to be the most 
widely-used petroleum 
products, with the 
average shares of 50.5 
percent and 28.4 
percent in the total oil demand, respectively. Transport will remain as the major petroleum 
consuming sector with an average share of 72.1 percent in the total oil demand for the entire 
planning period. 
Figure 3: FINAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION, BY FUEL (2000-2030)
Figure 2: TOTAL FINAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION, BY SECTORAL SHARE,
Actual (2000-2015), CES (2016-2030)Electricity will contribute 
an average of 22.1 
percent share to the final 
energy demand across 
the entire planning 
horizon, making it the 
second-most consumed 
fuel after oil. Electricity 
consumption is projected 
to grow by an average of 
5.7 percent annually over 
the entire planning 
horizon. Its utilization in 
the transport sector is 
seen to expand by ten (10) times its 2015 level of 8 thousand tons of oil equivalent (kTOE) to 80 
kTOE in 2030 due to expected government’s extension and expansion plans for the mass rail systems 
(MRT and LRT), possible development of other mass transit systems in the regions, and the 
significant penetration of electric vehicles in the road transport system. Household consumption will 
constitute the largest portion of electricity demand at 34.4 percent average share, followed by the 
industry sector with 32.3 percent (Figure 4).
Meanwhile, availability of efficient technologies, particularly end-use equipment for household 
cooking using LPG and electricity will pave the way for slowdown in the use of traditional fuels, and 
as such, end-use biomass consumption is projected to post a measly increase of 1.2 percent for the 
next 15 years. However, it will remain as the third most consumed fuel next to oil and electricity. The 
residential sector, as the major user of biomass, is seen to significantly contribute to the sluggish 
biomass demand level. Household usage of biomass will drop by 0.3 percent per year – from 5.8 
MTOE in 2015 to 5.6 MTOE in 2030. However, there will be a noticeable increase of 5.3 percent in 
industrial biomass usage during the planning period. 
End-use demand (non-power application) for coal is expected to increase by 5.1 percent on the 
average, owning an 8.0 percent share to the final energy demand across the entire planning period. 
Its consumption will increase from 2.2 MTOE in 2015 to 4.7 MTOE in 2030. The sustained rise in coal 
consumption can be attributed to the projected increase in the production of cement and basic 
metals which are used as construction materials for public and private sector infrastructures. 
Increasing the mandated biofuels blend for gasoline and diesel products will hike up total biofuel 
demand from 0.4 MTOE in 2014 to 2.6 MTOE in 2030. The 20 percent and 10 percent blends of 
bioethanol and biodiesel, respectively, towards 2030 will expand the aggregate demand for biofuels 
by as much as 12.8 percent per year. 
Meanwhile, end-use demand for natural gas will expand by 20.4 percent per year due to increasing 
requirements from the transport, industry and commercial sectors. The CNG-fueled buses and taxis 
are expected to penetrate road transport across the entire planning horizon. Natural gas is also 
expected to figure prominently as a fuel in several industrial parks, particularly in South Luzon, as 
Figure 4: TOTAL ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION, BY SECTOR (2000-2030) well as in other emerging industrial parks. Aside from this, natural gas technology is also expected to 
be used for cooling commercial centers, such as large shopping malls. 
Total Final Energy Consumption, by Sector 
Transport 
The transport sector will continue to dominate the country’s total energy demand, with an annual 
average share of 35.6 percent in the TFEC. Its energy requirement is projected to grow at a yearly 
rate of 4.4 percent,
from its demand level 
of 10.6 MTOE in 2015 
to 20.1 MTOE in 2030. 
The bulk of the 
sector’s energy 
demand will be used 
for land transport, 
where about 80.0 
percent of domestic 
traffic and 60.0 
percent of freight 
traffic is by land7
. 
As the Philippines is poised to become a major automotive market in Southeast Asia by 2020, with 
domestic sales expected to continue posting stellar growth while local production is seen ramping 
up with the government’s Comprehensive Automotive Resurgence Strategy (CARS) program8
, oil will 
remain as the sector’s major fuel, constituting the bulk (92.7 percent) of the sector’s total energy 
requirement for the next 15 years. Diesel will account for half of oil demand at 50.1 percent share
by 2030, albeit lower than its 2015 share of 57.5 percent, as significant volume of its consumption 
will be displaced due to the projected entry of additional CNG-fueled buses and significant increase 
in biodiesel blend, causing a modest growth in diesel demand of 2.8 percent until 2030 (Figure 5). 
Gasoline is the second major fuel of the sector. The increased penetration of electric vehicles 
(including e-trikes and hybrid vehicles) and significant increase in the bioethanol blend will slightly 
cap gasoline consumption to 5.1 percent per year, as its level is expected to reach 7.8 MTOE in 2030, 
from 3.7 MTOE in 2015. 
Given the vulnerability of global oil prices to geopolitical tensions and the growing concern on 
sustainable development, the DOE will continue to intensify its campaign for the utilization of 
cleaner alternative fuels in the transport sector. Demand for bioethanol will expand by 11.0 percent 
per year on the average, reaching 1.3 MTOE by the end of the planning period. Meanwhile, demand 
for biodiesel is seen to increase by 15.0 percent per year for the next 15 years.

Figure 5: TRANSPORT ENERGY DEMAND, BY FUEL (2000-2030)Figure 6: INDUSTRY ENERGY DEMAND, BY FUEL (2000-2030)
Largely due to further developments in the country’s light railway systems, specifically: the capacity 
expansion and modernization of Line 1; Line 2 East and West route expansion; NAIA rail link and 
North and Cavite route expansion projects9; the expansion of mass railway transits in regional areas; 
along with the expected entry of e-trikes and other e-vehicles, electricity demand will expand to 
reach 80 kTOE by 2030, from 8 kTOE in 2015. 
With the targeted commercialization of CNG-buses and CNG-taxis plying the major routes 
nationwide by 2030, natural gas use in the transport sector will reach 14 kTOE in 2030, from a nil 
value in 2015. 
Industry 
Under the Manufacturing Resurgence Program10,
the Philippines is expected to become the next
manufacturing hub in Asia11, and with the sector being a primary engine of growth in the country’s 
economy. With this, 
energy use for 
industrial processes 
is expected to 
intensify for the next 
15 years. From its 
2015 level of 6.8 
MTOE, it is projected 
to expand at an 
annual average rate 
of 5.7 percent while 
contributing an 
average share of 
26.6 percent in the 
country’s TFEC 
across the entire 
planning horizon. This will translate to demand levels going up by more than twice of its 6.8 MTOE in 
2015 to 15.6 MTOE in 2030 (Figure 6).
Industry will remain as the major end-use consumer of coal, as the fuel owns an average share of 
30.0 percent of the sector’s energy requirement over the entire planning horizon. This is largely due 
to the projected increase in coal utilization of cement and basic metals industries to meet the 
increasing demand for building materials in the construction sector. Likewise, coal demand in paper 
production, beverages and other food production is also projected to increase during the planning 
horizon. Coal consumption in industry is seen to expand by an average rate of 5.1 percent per year, 
to reach 4.7 MTOE in 2030 from 2.2 MTOE in 2015.

11 http://www.businessmirror.com.ph/2016/04/21/the-future-of-philippine-manufacturing/Meanwhile, electricity will take up an average share of 26.7 percent of the sector’s total energy 
demand. Machinery/equipment and basic metal production are the top industrial electricity 
consumers, followed by textile/apparel and other food production. Total electricity demand of the 
sector is projected to grow by an average of 5.1 percent, reaching 4.1 MTOE in 2030 from 1.9 MTOE 
in 2015. 
Notwithstanding its price volatility and the projected energy savings, oil will continue to play an 
important role in fueling the activities of the industry sector, accounting for an average of 19.7 
percent share of the sector’s total energy demand between 2016 and 2030. It will increase at an 
average rate of 5.9 percent per year, to reach 3.2 MTOE in 2030 from 1.4 MTOE in 2015. Bulk of this 
demand will comprise of diesel and fuel oil, registering an average yearly increase of 5.1 percent and 
3.8 percent, respectively, while consumption levels of LPG will increase by as much as 13.0 percent 
due to higher demand in the manufacturing sub-sectors. 
However, the industry players would most likely pursue the utilization of other energy sources to 
cope up with increasing production volume. Thus, biomass will still be an important fuel source for 
the sector, particularly in sugar production, food and other manufacturing industries. Total biomass 
consumption of industry is expected to increase to 2.7 MTOE in 2030, accounting for an average 
share of 18.1 percent of the total industry energy demand over the planning period. Natural gas will 
also figure prominently in the demand mix of the sector due to its utilization in industrial parks, with 
levels increasing by 20.1 percent per year to reach 772 kTOE in 2030. 
Residential Sector 
The residential 
sector is expected 
to contribute an 
average share of 
24.8 percent in the 
country’s total 
energy 
consumption during 
the planning period. 
From the 2015 total 
number of 
households of 23
million12, the total 
number of 
households is expected to reach 30.4 million in 2030, translating to an increase of 1.9 percent per 
annum. With this, the energy demand level of households will increase by 2.0 percent per year to 
11.8 MTOE in 2030, from 8.7 MTOE in 2015. The increased utilization of more efficient fuels, such as 
electricity and LPG, is a contributing factor to the changing energy demand mix of households, which 
consequently result to the slowdown in conventional fuels such as biomass and kerosene (Figure 7).
 
12 Philippine Statistics Authority: Highlights of the Philippine 2015 Census of Population (2016-058)
Figure7: RESIDENTIAL ENERGY DEMAND, BY FUEL (2000-2030)Despite a yearly decline of 0.3 percent, biomass will remain as the primary fuel in the residential 
sector, accounting for more than half of the sector’s energy demand (56.4 percent). Consumption of 
biomass is expected to reach 5.8 MTOE in 2030, from 5.5 MTOE in 2015, accompanied by a 
reduction in its share to total household energy consumption by as much as 19.4 percentage points 
between 2015 and 2030. 
Parallel with the DOE’s target to achieve a 100 percent household electrification level by 2020, 
electricity demand in the residential sector will increase by more than twice its 2015 level of 2.0 
MTOE to 4.1 MTOE in 2030, registering the fastest growth among household fuel of 6.1 percent per 
year. LPG consumption is also expected to follow the same trend of increase, albeit at a slower pace 
of 3.3 percent per year across the entire planning horizon. This can be attributed to the changing 
patterns of fuel preference among consumers for household activities such as cooking and heating, 
and the shifting to more efficient and convenient fuels and energy sources such as LPG and 
electricity. As such, kerosene is expected to decline by as much as 4.0 percent per year between 
2015 and 2030. 
Commercial Sector 
For several years, the consistent and resilient growth of trade, financial intermediation, and real 
estate and other business activities, which include the booming business process outsourcing (BPO) 
industry, supported the robust growth of the services sector. This is expected to continue towards 
the long-term, aided by 
higher foreign confidence 
and optimism attributed to 
increasing political stability in 
the country. As the country’s 
labor market attracts more 
international BPOs to 
establish their headquarters 
in the country, coupled with 
increased demand for major 
investment properties such 
as office, retail and hotel as 
well as residential property13
, 
the commercial sector’s 
energy requirement will 
increase at an average rate of 
4.7 percent - from 3.4 MTOE 
in 2015 to 6.8 MTOE in 2030. 
Electricity will remain as the major energy source in the sector constituting more than half (56.9 
percent on the average) of the total commercial demand, and will increase at an annual rate of 6.0 
percent throughout the planning period (Figure 8). 
 
Figure 8: COMMERCIAL ENERGY DEMAND, BY FUEL (2000-2030)Total petroleum demand will generally have a steady average annual growth of 2.9 percent during 
the entire planning period. LPG and fuel oil demand, owing to the rise in the output of 
establishments engaged in food and other related services, is projected to increase annually by 2.2 
and 2.4 percent, respectively. Diesel demand will still post a substantial growth rate of 3.3 percent 
per year. Expectedly, commercial sector will experience growth in biodiesel demand from 14 kTOE in 
2014, to 146 kTOE in 2030, as the mandatory blend escalates from 2 percent in 2015 to 10 percent 
between 2025 and 2030. 
Meanwhile, the consumption of biomass in the commercial sector, particularly fuel wood and 
charcoal, will still be prominent among food establishments and restaurants mainly for commercial 
cooking and heating. Its levels will fairly grow by 1.9 percent per annum within the planning period 
from 337 kTOE in 2015 to 444 kTOE by 2030. Natural gas is also expected to figure in the commercial 
sector’s demand mix at 58 kTOE by 2030. 
Agriculture, Fishery and Forestry (AFF) 
The country’s AFF sector will continue to be the least energy-intensive among the economic sectors 
accounting for a meager share of 1.1 percent in the total energy demand. The energy demand levels 
will improve from 401 kTOE in 2015 to 599 kTOE in 2030, or an average yearly growth of 2.7 percent. 
Energy demand in the AFF sector is comprised of: (1) petroleum products, used mainly for farm 
equipment, crop production and fishery; (2) electricity, largely used in the livestock and poultry subsector; and, (3) biodiesel which is a mandatory input to diesel categorized under petroleum products 
used for farm machineries and implements. Electricity will account for a 49.2 percent average share 
from 2016 to 2030; followed by petroleum products, which will take up as much as 47.9 percent 
share, and biodiesel with 2.9 percent share. 
Over the planning period, 
the sector will be heavily 
dependent on petroluem 
products, as its demand 
levels increase at an 
average annual growth 
rate of 3.5 percent, from 
194 kTOE in 2015 to 324 
kTOE in 2030, spurred by 
the rise in diesel demand. 
As such, biodiesel 
demand will grow fastest 
at an average rate of 15.5 
percent across the 
planning period, 
increasing to 33 kTOE by 2030 from its 2015 level of 4 kTOE. Meanwhile, electricity demand in the 
sector will post an average annual growth rate of 1.2 percent due to the continued improvement in 
design, development and extension of technologies on postharvest and modernization. Farmers try 
to adopt new agricultural machineries and technologies which were electricity fueled (Figure 9).
Figure 9 : AFF ENERGY DEMAND, BY FUEL (2000-2030)GHG Emission 
Given the dynamics of energy demand under the BAU scenario, total greenhouse gases (GHG) 
emission from fossil fuels (oil, coal and natural gas) is foreseen to increase at 6.1 percent per year 
across the planning period, from 99.6 million tons of CO2 equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2015 to 241.2 
MtCO2 in 2030. Emission from the consumption of coal fuels shall account for an annual average rate 
of 55.5 percent of the total GHG emission, while those from oil-based fuels will account for an 
annual average share of 38.7 percent, with natural gas contributing 5.7 percent share (Figure 10). 
With the entry of cleaner fuels and higher share of RE in the CES, total GHG emission under the CES 
scenario will drop to 172.0 MtCO2e in 2030 as growth slows down at an annual average rate of 3.7 
percent across the planning horizon. 
Under the BAU, half or around 52.3 percent of the total emission will come from the transformation 
sector or electricity generation. Meanwhile, from among the energy end-use sectors, transport will 
account for the biggest share to the total GHG emission around translating to an annual average 
share of 28.5 percent, followed by industry comprising 13.0 percent, while 6.1 percent shares will

CLEAN ENERGY SCENARIOcome from other sectors such as commercial, residential and agriculture. For CES, although bulk of 
the emission will come from the electricity generation sector, its share to the total GHG shall be 
slightly lower at 52.3 percent only, vis-à-vis its share under the BAU (Figure 11). 
Primary Energy Supply Outlook 2015-2030 
The country’s total primary energy supply (TPES) under the BAU scenario will grow at an annual 
average rate of 3.5 percent to reach 86.9 MTOE in 2030, from 51.7 MTOE in 2015. Throughout the 
planning period for BAU scenario, coal and oil will dominate the supply mix, as both fuels account for 
more than 30.0 percent of the TPES in 2030. On the other hand, major sources of renewable energy 
(RE) such as geothermal, biomass and hydro are expected to contribute in the TPES at the average 
shares of 13.7, 13.3 and 4.9 percent, respectively (Figure 12). 
Meanwhile, TPES under the CES will reach 93.7 MTOE in 2030, 7.9 percent higher than the BAU for 
the same year, while growth is faster at 4.0 percent per year. The difference is due to the expected 
reduction in fossil fuels, particularly oil and coal, as it gives way to the increasing production of RE 
for power generation, particularly geothermal energy and combined solar and wind across the 
planning horizon. This tapers down the aggregate share of coal and oil in the TPES to an annual 
average of 54.9 percent under the CES scenario. The natural gas average share to the supply mix will 
increase to 7.5 percent in comparison with its share of 4.7 percent under BAU scenario. Moreover, 
the anticipated share of RE sources under the CES will increase to 36.4 percent by 2030, as levels rise 
up by almost twice its 2015 level of 19.6 MTOE to 34.1 MTOE in 2030. On the other hand, other 
technologies that will penetrate under the CES are also expected to contribute to TPES at 2.0 MTOE 
by 2030.
Figure 12: TOTAL PRIMARY ENERGY SUPPLY, BY FUEL TYPE (2000-2030), CES vs. BAU Fossil Fuels 
Oil 
The country’s total primary oil supply is projected to grow by 3.4 percent per year on average in the 
BAU scenario, from 17.7 MTOE in 2015 to 29.1 MTOE in 2030. It will continue to contribute 
significantly to the country’s total energy mix, with an average share of 34.3 percent across the 
entire planning horizon. 
With an additional blending of biofuels and entry of alternative fuels for transport such as auto-LPG 
jeepneys and electric vehicles (including e-trikes) from BAU scenario to CES, the country’s 
dependence on oil is expected to decline at an average of 11.7 percent per year for the planning 
period. Oil annual average share to the TPES will register at 29.2 percent, as the total oil supply 
under CES will grow at a slower rate of 3.2 percent per year to 28.4 MTOE in 2030 (Figure 13). 
Coal 
Under the BAU, total coal supply will increase at a faster rate of 6.2 percent annually, rising by more 
than twice its 2015 level of 11.6 MTOE to 28.1 MTOE in 2030, while bringing its share in the TPES to 
33.0 percent in 2030, from 22.5 percent in 2015. The increase in coal supply is due to the significant 
contribution of coal as fuel input for power generation as an estimated aggregated capacities of 
around 13,265 megawatts (MW)
14 of new coal generating plants will be considered within the 
planning period. There is also an increasing requirement of coal in the industry sector, specifically for 
cement and basic metals production (Figure 14). On the other hand, coal supply under the CES will 
increase at a slower rate of 2.8 percent, reaching 17.5 MTOE level in 2030, while halving its share 
from the BAU to TPES in 2030 to 18.6 percent. This is consistent with the government’s efforts in 
promoting the utilization of renewable energy and cleaner fuels in power generation for 
environmental considerations under the CES scenario.

Figure 13: TOTAL OIL SUPPLY, ACTUAL ( 2000-2030), CES and BAUNatural Gas 
Under the BAU, natural gas is projected to increase at a rate of 3.6 percent per year across the entire 
planning horizon, from 2.9 MTOE in 2015 to 4.9 MTOE in 2030 (Figure 15). The country’s gas supply 
outlook will still be largely hinged on the production of the Malampaya field, including additional gas 
(uncontracted gas) until 2025. Aside from the Libertad gas field in Cebu which started commercial 
production in 2010, potential gas fields foreseen to produce commercially within the next 20 years 
include San Martin by 2015, Sultan sa Barongis and Sampaguita by 2023, Sulu Sea by 2025, among 
others. 
Meanwhile, natural gas supply will grow faster under CES by 9.8 percent per year, as levels increase 
by as much as four (4) times its 2015 level to reach 11.7 MTOE in 2030. Assuming realization of 
production targets, the growth will also be largely due to the government’s effort to promote the 
utilization of green fuel15 for power generation.
 
15 RE and Natural Gas 
Figure 15: NATURAL GAS SUPPLY, Actual (2000-2030), CES and BAU
Figure 14: COAL SUPPLY, ACTUAL (2000-2030) CES and BAURenewable Energy 
Under the BAU scenario, aggregate renewable energy (RE) supply will account for 28 percent share 
of TPES in 2030 as it increases at an average rate of 1.5 percent per year to reach 24.3 MTOE from 
19.6 MTOE in 2015. On the other hand, RE supply is projected to grow at a faster rate of 3.8 percent 
per annum in the CES, as its level will increase to 34.1 MTOE by 2030, along with an improved 
contribution to TPES at 36.4 percent for the same year (Figure 16).
Geothermal energy will continue to be the country’s major RE resource accounting for more than 
40.0 percent of the total RE under the BAU Scenario. Geothermal energy production will reach 8.6 
MTOE in 2030 from 9.5 MTOE in 2015, a gradual decline of 0.7 percent for the next 15 years. On the 
other hand, supply of geothermal energy will grow at a faster rate of 3.0 percent in the CES to reach 
14.9 MTOE in 2030, accounting for an average share of 41.5 percent to the total RE. A total of 253 
MW16 of additional geothermal power capacities will be online between 2016 and 2030. 
Hydropower supply under the BAU and CES will register the same average annual growth rate of 4.3 
percent, from 2.2 MTOE in 2015 to 4.1 MTOE in 2030. For the period 2016 to 2030, hydropower will 
constitute an annual average share of 4.9 percent to the TPES under the BAU scenario, while a 
slightly higher share of 5.3 percent under the CES. The commissioning of hydro power projects 
within the planning period will be bringing an additional installed capacity of 1,554 MW17. 
Combined supply level of solar and wind under the BAU is projected to decline at a steady rate of 
0.2 percent per year, from 76.3 kTOE in 2015 to 73.9 kTOE in 2030. The level of supply of these 
sources of energy under the CES will be more than four (4) times higher, while increasing at an 
average rate of 14.4 percent annually to bring combined solar and wind supply to 575.2 kTOE in 
2030. The policy mechanisms set under the RE law to include the National Renewable Energy

Figure 16: TOTAL RE SUPPLY, ACTUAL (2000-2030), CES and BAUProgram (NREP) and the Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS), among others, will serve as a catalyst 
to the rapid increase on the level of supply of these sources of energy. 
Biomass18 is expected to account for an average share of 13.3 percent in total supply mix under the 
BAU, posting a gradual increase of 1.3 percent per year, as supply levels reach 9.0 MTOE in 2030 
from 7.4 MTOE in 2015. It can be noted that the slight upswing in biomass supply stems from the 
industry sector’s increasing demand for this fuel at around 5.6 percent annually, specifically in the 
sugar production industry. Likewise, biomass supply in power generation will grow at an annual 
average rate of 4.4 percent due to additional capacities of biomass-fed power plants that will be put 
up within the planning period. Meanwhile under the CES, biomass supply will take as much as 13.8 
percent of the total TPES by 2030, and is expected to increase at a slightly faster rate of 2.5 percent 
per year due to its utilization for power generation. 
Alternative Fuels 
Biodiesel 
Biodiesel supply under the BAU scenario will reach 1.3 MTOE by 2030, a yearly increase of 15.2 
percent from 0.2 MTOE in 2015. It will account for an average share to TPES at 0.7 percent across 
the entire planning period. On the other hand, supply levels under the CES is expected to reach 2.8 
MTOE in 2030, growing at an annual average rate of 21.3 percent per year. Biodiesel’s contribution 
to the TPES is also expected to increase from 0.3 percent share in 2015 to 3.0 percent share in 2030. 
The target biodiesel blend is expected to increase by as much as 10 percent by 2025 under the 
biomass roadmap of the NREP. 
Bioethanol 
While the move to increase utilization of environment-friendly fuels is further strengthened, 
bioethanol blend is projected to increase to a maximum blend of 20 percent starting in 2020. Over 
the planning horizon, bioethanol production under the BAU scenario is projected to grow at an 
average rate of 11.1 percent, reflecting higher level of supply in 2030 of 1.4 MTOE from its level 
2015 level of 0.3 MTOE. On the other hand, under the CES scenario its level of supply will reach 1.1 
MTOE, translating to annual increases of 9.7 percent for the next 15 years.

OIL AND GAS 
Overview 
As of first semester of 2016, the DOE is supervising and monitoring 25 active petroleum service 
contracts in the country, mostly resulting from the conduct of five (5) Philippine Energy Contracting 
Rounds (PECR) conducted in 2003, 2005, 2006, 2011 and 2014, respectively. The regular conduct of 
PECR aims to provide transparent and competitive system of tendering onshore and offshore oil and 
gas blocks for exploration to both local and foreign investors. Listed on Table 2 is a list of the active 
petroleum service contracts in the Philippines.

PECR-5 offered 11 areas/blocks over Southeast Luzon, West Masbate/Iloilo, East Palawan, Reed 
Bank and West Luzon Basins. Although the low and volatile oil prices have somehow affected the 
turn-out of possible investors, three bids have qualified and being reviewed by the Department of 
Finance for their endorsement to Malacañang before the awarding of contracts. 
In terms of the available petroleum resources in the country, as shown in Table 3, total reserves of 
43 million barrels (MMB) of oil, 3,772 billion cubic feet (BCF) of gas and 109 MMB of condensate can 
be found mostly in the basins of Northwest Palawan and Cagayan. Potential resources for oil and gas 
is at 125 MMB and 68 BCF, respectively, while undiscovered mapped resources from the 14 
sedimentary basins all over the country will reach 1,341 MMB of oil, 8,303 BCF of gas and 55 MMB 
of condensate. 
Since 2012 until 2015, production of oil has reached 8.96 MMB while production of gas from 
Malampaya Field was recorded 515.05 BCF with associate condensate of 16.57 MMB during the 
same period. Additional production of 1.04 MMB of oil, 73.67 BCF of gas and 2.19 MMB condensate 
was also realized during the first half of 2016. 
Roadmap
Shown in Figure 17 is the DOE’s 2016-2030 road map for the upstream oil and gas sector. For the 
planning horizon, the DOE will push for the regular conduct of PECRs to attract more foreign and 
local investments. Out of the 25 existing service contracts in the country, 20 service contracts are 
foreseen to be producing additional petroleum resources between 2016 and 2030. 
By 2017, the estimated petroleum reserves will yield 94.75 MMB of oil, 3.97 trillion cubic feet (TCF) 
of gas and 41.35 MMB of condensate. These will include currently producing oil fields as well as 
marginal fields that maybe developed, rehabilitated or redeveloped during the planning period. An 
increase of about 17.0 percent is expected by the end of the planning period with reserves of 11.53 
MMB of oil, 5.72 TCF of gas and 45.8 MMB of condensate. 
Aside from the remaining reserves of Malampaya and other marginal fields such as San Martin, 
Sampaguita, Sultan sa Barongis, Octon and Polyard A8 which are anticipated to be developed and 
produced during the planning period, the reserves of associated condensate from Octon and Sultan 
sa Barongis fields are also assumed to be developed in the future.

Potential Resources 125 68 - 
Undiscovered Mapped Resources 1,341 8,303 55 To achieve the sector’s overall objective by 2030 of increasing oil and gas production, the DOE is 
targeting additional discovery of new fields for the country, namely two service contracts to yield 10 
MMB of oil and 1 TCF of gas with 8 MMB of condensate for the medium-term as well as five service 
contracts with 20 MMB of oil and 1.5 TCF of gas with 15 MMB of condensate for the long-term. 
The country may likewise expect production of 75 MMB of oil, 2.4 TCF of gas and 32.9 MMB of 
associated condensate for the 14-year planning period. However, expected production data will 
depend on the following assumptions: 
(1) Development, redevelopment and production of Octon (SC-6A), West Linapacan A (SC14C2), Malampaya Oil Rim and Linapacan B oil fields in 2019, 2020, 2024 and 2026, 
respectively; 
(2) Galoc (SC-14C), the largest oil field in the country, will continue production until 2021; 
(3) Cadlao field, a major oil producer in the 1980s until it stopped operations in 1991, will be 
rehabilitated in 2018; 
(4) Commencement of development and production of San Martin and Sampaguita gas fields in 
2020 and 2025, respectively; and 
(5) Continuing gas production of Malampaya until 2025. 
Figure 17. 2016-2030 ROADMAP OF THE UPSTREAM OIL AND GASAction Plan 
The DOE strives to accomplish the short-, medium- and long-term goals through the following action 
plans: 
 More stringent monitoring of existing Service Contracts in both exploration and production 
phases to ensure compliance with the approved work program of the DOE and in accordance 
with the industry’s internationally-accepted safety standards 
 Continuous monitoring of (a) seismic data acquisition, processing and subsequent interpretation, 
(b) exploration and appraisal well drilling and testing operations and (c) lifting/off-taking 
activities of crude oil and condensate produced 
 Active participation in geological and geophysical studies and assistance to the setting of 
Environmental Standards 
 Continuous improvement in the issuance process of Tax Exemption Certificates to SC operators, 
endorsement letters to LGUs and other government agencies, registration of technical and 
administrative sub-contracts and registration of performance bonds by SC operators 
 Conduct of more information, education and communication (IEC) campaigns for a more 
socially-accepted implementation of petroleum exploration, development and production 
activities. 
COAL 
Overview 
Coal will continue to form part of the country’s energy mix, both in power and non-power use, 
contributing 22.7 percent share. Hence, the DOE has put forth its efforts in expanding further the 
exploration and development of the country’s domestic coal resource potential. Currently, the 
Philippines maintains 15 coal basins with total resource potential of 2.4 billion metric tons (BMT) and 
in-situ coal reserves of about 407.80 million metric tons (MMMT). 
There is an improved interest in coal mining as seen in the increase in the number of coal 
contractors and small-scale permittees. As of end-2015, a total of 78 Coal Operating Contracts (48 
explorations and 30 development / production) and 76 Small-Scale Coal Mining Permits are being 
monitored and supervised by 
the DOE. 
Production. There is an 
increased production output by 
existing coal operating contract 
holders from 2012-2015 
recording a a total of 29.38 
MMMT of coal produce. 
Providing bulk of of the 
production output is the largest

(SMPC). with an average share of 96.57 percent over the four year period. There was however a 
slight decrease in production in 2015 in view of the two (2) month suspension of coal mining 
activities of SMPC. This was a consequence of the landslide incident at the Northwall of Panian Pit 
that occurred on 17 July 2015. Other contract holders also encountered various delays in the 
implementation of their coal mining projects due to other factors such as Local Government Unit 
(LGU) opposition, social acceptability issues and delays in the issuances of necessary 
permits/certificates from other involved agencies such as the NCIP and DENR. 
Importation. With the demand for coal in the power generation sector, coal importation has been 
increasing between 2012 and 2015, from 11.9 MMMT in 2012 to 17.3 MMMT in 2015. The 
significant increase can be attributed with the installation of five (5) new coal power plants from 
2013-2015 with a capacity totalling 1,088.6 MW. Almost 99.0 percent of imported coal was sourced 
from Indonesia while the remaining was coming from Australia, Vietnam and Russia.
Consumption. Consumption of coal notably increased for the last four (4) years, from 15.3 MMMT in 
2012 to 22.01 MMMT in 2015, averaging an increase of 11 percent. The power generation sector 
accounted the largest consumer with 77.3 percent of the total coal consumption. Coal is used as 
baseload to supply the country’s electricity demand followed by the cement industry with 15.9 
percent while 6.8 percent is consumed for industrial and direct users such as the steel/metal 
industry, food manufacturing and textile industry.
Exportation. Coal exports also posted double-digit growth of 81.8 percent to reach 5.8 MMMT in 
2014, from 2.7 MMMT in 2012. China remains the country’s top export market for coal, followed by 
Thailand, Hong Kong, Cambodia, Korea, Taiwan, India and Papua New Guinea.

Policy Initiatives 
The existing regulations on trading and sale of coal have been revisited and rationalized to address 
the unregulated operation 
of coal trading and 
utilization in the Philippines 
that resulted in substantial 
losses in government’s 
share from coal mining 
operations. 
The DOE promulgated Department Circular No. 2012-05-0006, (Guidelines on the Accreditation of 
Coal Traders and Registration of Coal End-Users) which was aimed at curbing illegal coal mining and 
trading activities and to collect appropriate the government share from locally produced coal. The 
said Circular mandates that no person, partnership, cooperative or corporation shall engage in the 
trading or utilization of coal within the Philippines, unless duly accredited or registered with the 
DOE. A series of IECs on the implementation of the circular were conducted in the areas in Legazpi, 
Albay (10-11 February 2014), Bislig City, Surigao (04-05 August 2014) and General Santos City (27-28

Traders and 136 Registered Coal End-Users as of March 2016. 
There were some illegal mining 
activities encountered in March 
2014 in Barangays Sula, Bacacay 
and Bagaobawan, in Albay which 
confiscated more than a thousand 
tons of coal. Similar activities also 
happened in Imelda, Zamboanga 
Sibugay in July 2015. 
International Cooperation 
To enhance cooperation in the coal sector within the ASEAN region, the ASEAN Forum on Coal 
(AFOC) was organized under the auspices of the ASEAN Energy Cooperation. AFOC aims to promote 
sustainable coal development and utilization through greater private sector participation and 
investment. The AFOC membership includes state-owned and private companies, institutions and 
government agencies in the ASEAN involved in the coal industry. Relatedly, AFOC Philippines was 
created in line with the establishment of National Committees in each ASEAN member state under 
the AFOC Charter. 
Some of the major activities jointly conducted by the DOE and AFOC Philippines were the hosting of 
the 5th AFOC Council Meeting in November 2005 in Manila and the 11th AFOC Council Meeting backto-back with the 2nd Meeting of the Board of Judges for ASEAN Energy Coal Awards on 5-7 June 2013 
in Cebu. The DOE and AFOC Philippines also facilitated the formulation, consultation and eventual 
issuance of DC-2012-05-0006. 
Roadmap 
The DOE will continue to work on expanding the country’s domestic coal resource potential of about 
2.53 billion metric tons. Towards achieving this goal, the country’s roadmap for the coal industry 
sector from 2016-2030 is outlined in Figure 19. 
From 407.80 MMMT in-situ coal reserves produced in 2015, this is seen to escalate to about 821.7 
MMMT by 2017 to further increase to 1,248.1 MMMT by 2020. For the next ten years, it is expected 
that the county’s reserves will reach 4,297.7 MMMT. Declaration of coal reserves in commercial 
quantity (mineable) by coal exploration contract holders is likewise seen to take place starting 2016 
to 2020, which include the would-be result of the ongoing exploration activities in the Semirara 
Mining Corporation. 
Coal Stockpile in Imelda, Zamboanga SibugayAccordingly, increased production is expected during the planning horizon as new exploration 
contracts are accelerated to full blown production, and converted to production agreements. For the 
near term, about 28.3 MMMT production are expected from the existing coal producers and 
contract holders which is targeted to increase to 43.2 MMMT by 2020. Towards the end of the 
planning period, a robust production of 158.0 MMMT are seen to be generated. 
Action Plan 
Realizing these goals requires extensive efforts from both the government and the private sector to 
propel development in the sector. As a continuing strategy, the DOE will carry on the following 
strategies, plans and programs to stimulate investors’ interest in coal exploration and development. 
• Continuing conduct of the PECR for coal to select the most qualified operators that will be 
able to explore and delineate coal deposits of commercial quantity that can be economically 
developed and mined.
• Vigilant monitoring of coal mining operations to check compliance with the DOE approved 
work program to ensure that commitment of coal operating contract holders in the 
development and production phase is met.
• The DOE, with the assistance of law enforcement agencies and LGUs will continue its 
campaign against unauthorized coal mining and trading activities through an intensified 
Figure 19. 2016-2030 ROADMAP OF COAL Pililia Rizal 54-MW Wind Farm
implementation of the DC-2015-0506 to efficiently account the country’s coal flow and to 
properly manage indigenous coal resources.
• In a bid to reduce carbon footprint of coal generation, adoption of clean technologies will be 
promoted to maximize the use of coal for power generation. 
• While we apply multi-fuel policy, coal-fired power plants remain to be the least cost and 
immediately available option in the near term. As such, development of coal mine-mouth 
power projects is seen to facilitate the utilization of relatively low rank coals. 
• Continuous issuance of Certificate of Compliance for coal importation will be facilitated to 
meet the country’s coal demand and Small-Scale Coal Mining Permits to develop and mine 
marginalized coal deposits.
• To resolve issues on health, environment and social acceptability, the government in 
collaboration with the stakeholders will strengthen its efforts in the conduct of IEC to 
facilitate implementation of coal exploration and mining, i.e. provincial resolutions which 
ban coal mining, LGUs opposition to mining. 
• Continuous capacity building with the ASEAN Forum on Coal (AFOC).
• Continuous annual attendance to various relevant conventions and workshops, i.e. the 
Annual Clean Coal Technology, School of Coal, Coal Bed Methane, National Mine Safety and 
Environment Conference, Annual Geological Convention, among others. 
RENEWABLE ENERGY
Overview 
The accelerated exploration and development of 
renewable energy sector commenced with the 
enactment of RA 9513 otherwise known as 
Renewable Energy Law of 2008. To achieve the 
objectives of RE Law, the DOE with its stakeholders 
headed by the National Renewable Energy Board 
(NREB) formulated the NREP which summarizes the 
20-year aspirational targets from biomass, solar, 
wind, hydropower, geothermal and ocean energy. 
The NREP, which was launched in 2011, serves as 
the country’s roadmap in the development and 
utilization of renewable energy in the country. The 
targets under NREP envision to triple the 2010 installed capacity of 5,439 MW. As of end June 2016, 
the total installed capacity of RE is 7,013.89 MW, an increase of 1,574.89 MW which is equivalent to a 29 percent over that of the 2010 level (Table 7). To meet the tripling of capacity target, a total of 
14,499.96 MW potential capacity has been awarded to private investors for development.

Paving the way in the fulfillment of NREP targets are policy mechanisms promulgated by the DOE. 
Among the ones are in place are the Feed in Tariff (FIT) and the Net Metering Mechanism. The 
remaining policy mechanism that needs to be implemented includes the Renewable Portfolio 
Standard (RPS) and Green Energy Option which are expected to further boost the share of 
renewables in the country. 
Under the FIT system, due to the energy stakeholders’ interest in the development of wind energy, 
initial target for FIT system of 200 MW was increased to 400 MW. Of this adjusted target, 393.9 MW 
have been issued with certificate of eligibility by the DOE to ERC. Likewise, operating under the FIT 
system is solar which was increased to 500 MW in 2015 from the 50 MW initial target. As of June 30, 
2016, a total of 526.95 MW was issued with certificate of eligibility by the DOE to ERC.

There are also policy issuances by the DOE to boost the development and utilization of RE in the 
county. The most recent circular issued by the DOE to support the development and utilization of 
renewables is DC No. 2015-07-0014 on 26 June 2015 prescribing the policy for maintaining the share of RE resources in the country’s installed capacity through the holistic implementation of the 
pertinent provisions of RA 9513 on the feed-in tariff (FIT) system, priority and must dispatch, among 
others. 
Open and Competitive Selection Process (OCSP) 
As a continuing strategy to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy, the DOE launched the 
2
nd OCSP on 23 February 2015 for geothermal wherein four (4) prospective geothermal areas were 
offered; to wit: (1) Acupan-Itogon Geothermal Prospect in Benguet (10-20 MW estimated capacity), 
(2) Cabalian Geothermal Prospect in Southern Leyte (26-34 MW estimated capacity), (3) Amacan 
Geothermal Prospect in Compostela Valley (20-40 MW estimated capacity) and (4) Balut Island 
Geothermal Prospect in Davao Occidental (10-40 MW estimated capacity). 
While on 20 March 2015, the OCSP for hydropower offered a total of 17 areas for Luzon, Visayas and 
Mindanao. In Luzon, there were six (6) areas with an aggregate capacity of 217.4 MW, Visayas has 
eight (8) areas with total capacity of 88.5 MW and Mindanao with three (3) large areas having an 
aggregate capacity of 402.5 MW. Total potential capacity from the particular OCSP conducted was 
708.4 MW. The Department will conduct another OCSP in 2017. 
Locally Funded and Foreign Assisted Renewable Projects 
To further expedite the exploration and development of renewable energy, the department 
embarked on a number of locally funded and foreign assisted projects. 
On-going Locally Funded Projects 
Detailed Wind Resource Assessment Project (WRAP) 
The WRAP aims to address the gaps in the country’s data on wind energy in order to provide the 
stakeholders and prospective investors a viable potential site of wind energy. The project, which 
started in 2013, involves detailed resource assessment activities in 40 pre-identified sites. Important 
component of the project is building local capability on various activities of wind resource 
assessment. Expected output of the project is the national wind database that are necessary in 
planning, designing and implementation of wind energy projects. 
Ocean Energy Potential Resource Assessment 
Ocean energy in the country is yet to takeoff and requires continuous research and development. 
The project aims to develop operational readiness and awareness of ocean energy technology in the 
country through technical capability building of the people involved in the project. Some of the 
deliverables of the project include: (i) conduct resource assessment of identified areas; (ii) 
familiarization with the operation of technology and equipment; (iii) conduct extensive IEC activities 
to stakeholders; and (iv) establish collaboration and strategic partnership with various government 
agencies and academe. On-going Foreign Assisted Projects 
Development for Renewable Energy Applications Mainstreaming and Market Sustainability 
(DREAMS) 
DREAMS project is a partnership between the DOE and UNDP aimed at reducing GHG emissions by
promoting and facilitating commercialization of renewable energy markets with the removal of 
barriers to increase investments in RE based power generation projects. The project also aims to 
strengthen national capacities by mainstreaming environment and energy concerns into national 
development plans and implementation systems 
Philippine-Japan Project for Introduction of Clean Energy Using Solar Power Generating System 
The Philippine-Japan Project for Introduction of Clean Energy Using Solar Power Generating System 
aims to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of net-metering scheme using solar PV. The 
expected output is installation of solar PV facilities under the net-metering scheme. 
Roadmap 
Sustainable renewable energy is a global call to counter the negative impacts of climate change to 
the environment, nature and people by the use of fossil fuels. The effects of climate change are 
current and real; it is no longer a future concern or imaginary. “In 2011, the United Nations 
Secretary–General launched the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) initiative with three interlinked 
objectives to be achieved by 2030: ensure universal access to modern energy services; double the 
global rate of improvement in energy efficiency; and double the share of renewable energy in the 
global mix”19. On a country level, the Philippines’ energy plans and programs are consistent with the 
SE4ALL initiative. 
The continuing thrust for energy and power mix is ensuring energy security and the use of 
environment-friendly energy resources/technologies while ensuring low carbon future. Consistent 
with this, the government has embarked on fuel diversification which envisions equal sharing of 
fuels and technologies with preference on cleaner fuel and reducing dependence on fossil fuels. It is 
in this context that deployment of more renewables is seen to accelerate in the coming years 
moving towards the realization of its goal of increasing RE capacity by 2030. 
The NREP, which comprises the 20-year RE target capacity addition for the country, has its first step 
towards the doubling of RE installed capacity in 2011. From 2011 to 2015, the first 5 years of the 
program, the target capacity addition was 2,155 MW or 22 percent of the total program. However, 
the actual capacity addition was 950.4 MW equivalent to 10 percent of the total program. The actual 
installed capacity aggregated over a 5-year period call for a revisit of NREP to lay down an updated 
roadmap consistent with the current and future development in the RE sector. Considering the 
thrusts and policy directions of the government toward increasing the share of RE in the total 
 
19From IRENA 2014: RE map 2030capacity mix, the following roadmap is expected to achieve the targeted capacity addition of 17,544 
MW for the next 15 years. 
GEOTHERMAL 
Overview 
The government is strengthening its push to mainstream renewable energy projects to diversify the 
country’s energy sourcing and boost power supply. Geothermal, a relatively mature RE source in the 
country, stands at a rated capacity of 1,906 MW as of December 2015, sustaining the Philippines 
second lead in the world’s geothermal capacity installation. The entry of 50-MW Nasulo 
Geothermal Power Plant, the rehabilitation of two (2) units of Bacman with an additional capacity of 
Figure 20. 2016-2030 ROADMAP OF RENEWABLE ENERGY 
OVERALL 
OBJECTIVE 
BY 2030 DOUBLE RE INSTALLED10 MW and the most recently commissioned 20-MW Maibarara Geothermal Power Project into the 
pipeline, have boosted the existing capacity of geothermal energy for electricity generation. 
These new additions brought the 
country’s total producing fields to seven 
(7), as shown in Figure 21. Production 
from these fields constitutes an average 
of 10.8 percent supply of the electricity 
requirements of the country for the same 
period.
Apart from these producing fields, the 
country has 35 Geothermal Service 
Contracts (GSCs) currently being 
monitored and supervised by the DOE. 
Two (2) of these GSCs (Biliran and 
Northern Negros) are already converted 
from pre-development to development 
stage while five (5) are Geothermal 
Operating Contracts (Makban, Tiwi, 
Tongonan 1, Palinpinon and Bacman) for 
power plant operations. Twenty-eight 
(28) GSCs, on the other hand, are under 
exploration or at pre-development stage 
(Figure 22). For the period 2012 – 2014, 
20 GSCs with estimated potential 
capacity of 130 MW were awarded. Once 
these contracts commenced operation, 
this will significantly boost existing 
capacity of renewable energy to the grid. 
Open and Competitive Selection Process 
(OCSP) 
As a strategy to accelerate renewable 
energy deployment, the DOE launched 
the 2nd OCSP on 23 February 2015 
wherein four (4) prospective geothermal 
areas were offered; to wit: (1) AcupanItogon Geothermal Prospect in Benguet
(10-20 MW estimated capacity), (2)
Cabalian Geothermal Prospect in Southern Leyte (26-34 MW estimated capacity), (3) Amacan 
Geothermal Prospect in Compostela Valley (20-40 MW estimated capacity) and, (4) Balut Island 
Geothermal Prospect in Davao Occidental (10-40 MW estimated capacity). 
Locally Funded Projects 
Figure 21. GEOTHERMAL SERVICE CONTRACTS (PREDEVELOPMENT STAGE)
Figure 22. GEOTHERMAL SERVICE CONTRACTS (DEVELOPMENT 
STAGE)Most of the country’s high enthalpy geothermal resources have already been developed into 
commercial operations. Aside from these, the country also hosts marginalized low enthalpy20
geothermal resources which still remain untapped for utilization and development. Effective 
utilization of these geothermal prospects will be another alternative for off-grid power generation 
and will be beneficial to the host community as they are typically located in remote areas. To fully 
utilize these resources, the DOE has been implementing locally-funded projects entitled “Detailed 
Resource Assessment of Selected Low-Enthalpy Geothermal Areas in the Philippines” and 
“Comprehensive Resource Assessment of Philippine Low-Enthalpy Geothermal Areas” to further 
explore and evaluate low to medium enthalpy geothermal areas in the country, with a temperature 
ranging from 90˚C to 150˚C that might be suitable for power generation. These projects will also 
facilitate the assessment and realization of the economic feasibility of small scale geothermal power 
projects for local power needs and the 
preparation of a comprehensive data 
package that will showcase this type of 
geothermal resource for future private 
investor participations. 
; Detailed Resource Assessment of 
Selected Low-Enthalpy Geothermal 
Areas in the Philippines 
The project aimed to characterize various 
low-enthalpy geothermal resources in 
the Philippines with the development of 
binary power systems using organic 
Rankine cycle which are suitable for 
power generation. Aside from this, it can 
be used for direct applications, such as, 
industrial, agricultural, tourism and 
health for balneological and therapeutic 
uses. Three (3) areas were identified 
under this project: (1) Banton Island in 
Romblon; (2) Balut Island in Davao 
Occidental; and (3) Maricaban Island in 
Batangas. 
After completing the geoscientific review, 
data-generation and integrated 
evaluation of these areas in 2015 have 
indicated that no geothermal system, 
active or relic exists in Banton Island geothermal prospect while Balut Island hosts an impressive 
geothermal resource with an estimated reservoir temperature ranging from 175-200°C (gas

On the other hand, an active geothermal system may be present in Maricaban Island geothermal 
prospect, dominated by “reworked” sea water. Further investigation was recommended by drilling 
two slimhole with an accumulated depth of 1,500 m. Additional MT and Gravity surveys are needed 
to further probe the geothermal resource of Maricaban Island (Tingloy) to collect core, temperature 
log and fluid samples. 
; Comprehensive Resource Assessment of Philippine Low-Enthalpy Geothermal Areas 
Another project currently being implemented is the conduct of “Comprehensive Resource 
Assessment of Low-Enthalpy geothermal areas” in Camiguin de Babuyanes in Cagayan, Camiguin in 
Camiguin Island and El Nido in Palawan. Current undertakings include the review and evaluation of 
existing data, remote sensing and aerial photo interpretation, semi-detailed geological, geochemical 
and geophysical surveys, resource characterization and conceptual modelling and pre-feasibility 
study. The integrated resource assessment is expected to be completed by 2nd quarter of 2017 and 
project completion by the end 2017.
Roadmap 
The government has embarked on fuel diversification which envisions a balanced mix of fuels and 
technologies with preference on cleaner fuel and a reduced dependence on fossil fuels. It is in this 
context that deployment of more renewables is seen to accelerate in the coming years moving 
towards the realization of its goal of increasing RE capacity by 2030. 
As outlined in the NREP Roadmap which presents the overall approach to accelerate, utilize and 
triple the 2010 RE installed capacity, the government envisions that aggregate capacities of about 
1,371 MW from geothermal projects will be integrated into the grid; 183 MW of which will already 
be deployed starting 2016-2020 while the next five years will mark a milestone in geothermal 
capacity integration as 900 MW indicative capacity is expected to be infused into the existing grid. 
For the last tranche covering 2016-2030, about 288 MW capacities are seen to be deployed. These 
projects, as listed in Table 9, are currently in different stages of development.

Action Plan 
To ensure success of the sector’s aspirational goal, the DOE, together with the industry stakeholders 
has intensified its efforts in the implementation of the following strategies: 
; The DOE will continuously pursue the conduct of OCSP where prospective geothermal areas will 
be offered and bid-out to private investors. 
; Assessment on the utilization of Low-Enthalpy Geothermal areas will also be a continuing 
activity to further assess the full potential of this type of geothermal resource. 
; Apart from large-scale geothermal resource development, the DOE is also pushing to develop 
the small-scale power and non-power application to maximize full potential of the country’s 
geothermal resources. Drafting of policy/guidelines for the direct use of small-scale geothermal 
energy will also be carried out during the planning period. 
; The DOE will also start conducting Research/ Feasibility Study on emerging technologies such as 
the Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS), Utilization of Acidic Reservoir and Geothermal Heat 
Pump. These advanced technologies offer the opportunity to access an enormous, local, clean 
energy resource. 
; IEC campaigns will be strengthened to address issues on environment and socio-cultural 
concerns especially those located in protected areas. Harmonization of government policies and 
regulations under the Republic Act No. 7586 or the “National Integrated Protected Areas System 
(NIPAS) of 1992” and the Republic Act No. 8371 or the “indigenous People’s Rights Act (IPRA) of 
1997” will facilitate implementation of energy projects. Close coordination with the LGUs and 
other concerned agencies will also speed up issuance of environmental permits and approval of 
SLUP, FLAG and TCP. 
; Optimization and Improvement of Geothermal Power Plant Efficiency and Energy Conversion 
; Continued improvement of database and networking for better data access of both internal and 
external clients ; Continued exploration of identified underexplored/unexplored assessment of geothermal areas 
(high and low) 
; Encourage service contractors to undertake expansion and full utilization or optimization of the 
geothermal projects 
; Establishment of Geothermal Training Center in coordination with RE stakeholders 
BIOFUELS 
Overview 
The country embraces the development of biofuels with anticipation of achieving energy security, 
augmenting farmer’s income, generating rural employment and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emission that can contribute in mitigating the effect of climate change. In 2007, the passage of 
Republic Act (R.A.) 9367 or otherwise known as the “Biofuels Act of 2006” together with Department 
Circular (D.C.) No. 2007-05-0006 or its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) mandated the use 
of biofuels and establishes the National Biofuels Program to ensure a sustained investment climate 
for production, distribution, and utilization of biodiesel and bioethanol. From then on, the 
government is constant in promoting the use of biofuels as an alternative and clean fuel in the 
transport sector. As a result, the total number of biofuel producers has increased continuously, from 
11 producers in 2011 to a total of 16 in 2014. At present, the country has already 21 biofuel 
producers located nationwide and 11 of which are biodiesel producers with total registered annual 
capacity of about 584.90 million liters, and about ten (10) are bioethanol producers with registered 
total annual capacity of 282.12 million liters (Table 10 and 11). 
Program Development (Evaluation, Accreditation and Monitoring)
As of end-2015, the DOE awarded two Certificates of Accreditation to Emperador Distillers, Inc. and 
Absolut Distillers, Inc., both are bioethanol producers with registered capacity of 30 million liters of 
bioethanol using molasses as their feedstock. Apart from accreditation, the DOE also monitored the

data (2,000 km.) was conducted in preparation for the development of test protocol and 
performance testing using brand new vehicles for higher biofuels (bioethanol/biodiesel) blend. 
Likewise, a continuing implementation of Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the DOE and 
Technological University of the Philippines (TUP) on the testing of 5 percent and 20 percent blend 
for in-use vehicles as well as road testing validation were conducted during the year. 
Research and Development Support
In terms of research and development, the DOE initiated a partnership with the academe to 
implement biofuel projects using alternative feedstocks such as sweet sorghum, cassava and macroalgae. As such, during the year, four projects were implemented to introduce and develop 
alternative feedstocks of biofuels in the country, namely; (1) the “Village Scale Production of MMSU 
Hydrous Ethanol as Feedstock for R&D in Biofuel Trials and Anhydrous Ethanol Production” which is 
already completed; (2) the “Establishment of a Community-Based Bioethanol Industry and Continued 
Research and Development on the Feasibility of Hydrous Bioethanol as Biofuel Blend” which has only 
started its implementation in 2015. Said projects are being implemented by Mariano Marcos State 
University (MMSU). On the other hand, the other projects are; (3) the “Bioethanol Production from 
Macro-algae and Socio-ecological Implications” being implemented by University of the PhilippinesVisayas Foundation Inc. (UP-VFI) which initially conducted a presentation result; and, the (4) the 
“Bioethanol Production Potential of Different Cassava Varieties under Northern Mindanao Condition 
and Development of a Pilot-Scale Cassava Bioethanol Plant” which is being implemented by Xavier 
University. 
Production and Sales
Biodiesel 
As of end-2015, the total production of biodiesel is at 204.03 million liters while total sale of fuel is at 
200.57 million liters. An increase of about 18.9 percent in production was achieved during the year 
as compared to 2014 total production which pegged at 171.65 million liters. Likewise, total sales of 
fuel also increased by 22.7 percent compared to previous year’s sales of 163.46 million liters (Table 
12). By first quarter of 2016, the total biodiesel production stood at 62.80 million liters while total 
sale of the fuel is at 57.04 million liters. 
At present, the DOE in cooperation with University of the 
Philippines-Los Baños (UP-LB) is conducting a study entitled 
“Economic Impact in the Increase Use of Biodiesel in the 
Philippines” to further evaluate the effect of increasing 
utilization of biodiesel in the country as well as to assess 
the impact on the nationwide implementation of B5 as 
mandated under the Biofuels Act of 2006.

production of the fuel pegged at 121.91 million liters 
whiles total sale is at 127.10 million liters. 
Roadmap 
The DOE has come up with a roadmap that will facilitate the implementation of the scheduled 
blending of biofuels from 2016 to 2030 in compliance with the “Biofuels Act of 2006” or R.A. 9367 
(Figure 24).
Accordingly, under the roadmap, for the short-term (2016-2019) period, biodiesel will maintain the 
current 2 percent blending level while bioethanol will be at 5 percent level. From medium to longterm planning period, the DOE together with the National Biofuels Board (NBB) will embark on 
revisiting/re-evaluating the blending requirement with due consideration on the availability of 
feedstock. Furthermore, a continuous conduct of research and development of biofuel feedstock 
sources will be implemented.

Overview 
Electricity is a key driver towards achieving rapid and sustained economic growth as it serves as a 
major input to economic production in the industrial, services and agriculture sectors. Having 
secured, sufficient, reliable, accessible, sustainable and reasonably-priced electricity supply provides 
socio-economic benefits to education through better study conditions and enhanced flow of 
information, health via improvements in sanitation and health care facilities and environment 
through the utilization of renewable energy resources and other clean energy options. Power supply 
security also has trickle down effects accruing to peace and order and poverty alleviation as it 
increases investment, business and employment opportunities leading to better standards of living. 
For the Philippines, the Republic Act No. 9136 otherwise known as the Electric Power Industry 
Reform Act of 2001 or EPIRA serves as the guiding principle governing the restructuring and 
transformation of the power industry into a fully competitive sector with the end view of ensuring 
supply security including greater access to electricity. 
Over the years, the DOE remained focused and adherent to its mandate to deliver quality, reliable, 
accessible, sustainable and reasonably-priced energy to Filipino people. However, the power sector 
confronted several issues and challenges ranging from incidents of power interruption, frequent 
forced outages of power facilities, inconsistencies in policy issuances and implementation by various 
government agencies, addressing barriers to entry of new power providers, among others. 
Addressing these challenges was made more difficult due to the country’s inherent geographical 
condition as well as its vulnerability to natural calamities. With these, stringent measures and 
strategies were implemented under the stewardship of the DOE in partnership with its attached 
agencies and stakeholders. 
Power Demand and Supply 
 Peak Demand. System peak demand for the three main grids continue to increase in 2015. 
For Luzon, the highest demand was recorded at 8,928 MW which was 2.4 percent higher 
than the year-ago level at 8,717 MW. Meanwhile, the highest growth rate was observed in 
the Visayas at 8.1 percent or a 132 MW increase from 2014-2015. In Mindanao, the 
recorded peak demand, including embedded loads, was at 1,517 MW which was 3.3 percent 
higher than in 2014.
 Capacity Addition. To cope up with the increasing electricity demand, the Philippines’ total 
installed generating capacity continued to grow by 4.6 percent from 17,944 MW in 2014 to 
18,765 MW in 2015 equivalent to 821 MW increase. Coal-fired power plants constitute the 
largest share in the installed and dependable capacity in 2015 at 32% and 34 percent 
respectively. Among renewable energy, the share of the hydro resource remained the 
highest at 19 percent majority of which comes from the Mindanao Grid. With the FIT 
incentives and continued support of the DOE and energy agencies and stakeholders, variable renewable energy (VRE) particularly wind and solar grew remarkably by 50.9 percent (144 
MW increase) and 616.0 percent (142 MW increase) respectively, from 2014 to 2015.
Transmission Development 
 
Transmission development remains a top priority of the government to accommodate the increasing 
capacity additions to the main grid. The National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP), the 
Concessionaire of the national transmission backbone, has undertaken various programs and 
projects which concerns transmission network development in accordance with their Transmission 
Development Plan (TDP). Among the major network projects include reinforcement of transmission 
backbones, rehabilitation of existing transmission lines, and uprating/upgrading of substations. 
Existing transmission facilities in the country in 2015 consist of transmission lines, sub-transmission 
lines and submarine cables in circuit kilometers with corresponding substation capacity (MVA) and 
reactive/capacitive compensation (MVAR). In 2015, a total of 633 circuit-km of overhead 
transmission lines, 1,025 MVA additional capacities and 600 MVAR of reactive power support were 
installed. 
Distribution Development 
The EPIRA and its IRR mandate all DUs to submit annually to the DOE and in case of ECs, 
through the National Electrification Administration (NEA), their Distribution Development 
Plan (DDP) which contain among others, the infrastructure projects and corresponding 
requirements needed to ensure delivery and reliability of supply to their customers. In 2015, 
the total existing distribution lines and substation reached 154,338 ckt-km and 24,783 
megavolt-ampere (MVA) respectively. 
Policies and Program Developments
In pursuit of its mandate of ensuring supply security and greater energy access in all parts of the 
country, the DOE continued to improve implementation of existing programs and projects and 
spearheaded the formulation and development of various policies and programs: 
Interruptible Load Program (ILP) 
In 2015, the country experienced “yellow” and “red” alert status due to thin reserves and forced 
outages of power plants. As part of the counter measures, the DOE and the Energy Regulatory 
Commission (ERC) implemented the Interruptible Load Program (ILP)21. Under this program, 
Distribution Utilities (DU) and its Participating Customers (PCs) enter into an agreement for a 
voluntary full or partial de-loading of the PC during a mutually agreed period of time. PCs with standby generation capacities that are requested by the DU to participate in the ILP during instances of 
power supply deficits will be compensated should they use their own generating facilities. 
 
21 ERC Resolution No. 8, Series of 2010 and amended by Resolution No. 8, Series of 2013To date, there are about 3,612 MW of self-generating facilities (SGFs) potential for ILP, excluding 
those SGFs owned by firms that are directly connected to the grid. There are about 979 MW SGF 
capacity are committed to participate in the ILP in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. In Luzon, MERALCO 
has 792.65 MW in Luzon for its Captive Customers and Contestable Customers within its franchise 
area. The Visayan Electric Company is the lone implementer in the Visayas with 63.70 MW while 
seven (7) DUs in Mindanao have implemented the ILP involving 48 SGFs with combined capacity of 
58.40 MW. 
Mindanao Modular Generator Set Program 
This program was implemented to provide the needed additional power supply to electricity endusers in Mindanao. Through Executive Order 137, the Department of Budget and Management 
(DBM) was directed to release the amount of Four Billion Five Hundred Million Pesos (PhP 4.5 
Billion) sourced from the Malampaya Fund for the implementation of the said modular generator 
sets program. Under the Program, a loan facility is extended to participating electric cooperatives 
(ECs) in Mindanao for the acquisition of the modular gensets as an immediate relief to supply the 
needed power in the franchise areas of ECs. The ECs have the option to eventually retain the 
generator sets or return the generator sets to the Government when the power supply in Mindanao 
has already stabilized after the entry of new power generation projects. Following are the ECs with a 
total of 51 MW capacity that availed the Program as of 21 December 2016 corresponding to total 
amount of PhP 1,056,261,960. 
Interim Mindanao Electricity Market (IMEM) 
The IMEM was intended to augment supply by serving as a venue for transparent and efficient 
utilization of all the available capacities in the Mindanao Grid. The program started commercial 
operations on 3 December 2013; however, due to system blackout, the Mindanao System Operator 
declared an IMEM intervention starting 27 February 2014. On 07 May 2014, the DOE issued 
Department Circular No. DC 2014-05-0010 entitled “Amending the Interim Mindanao Electricity 
Market Rules and Providing for Transitory Arrangements”. Currently, the lifting of market 
intervention has been postponed until such time that the mechanisms in the market have been 
amended and the issues on settlement have been resolved. 
Competitive Selection Process (CSP) 
To institutionalize a transparent system of power supply contracting that ensure provision of 
adequate and reliable supply of electricity to all end-users, the DOE issued on 11 June 2015, 
Department Circular No. DC2015-06-0008, “Mandating All Distribution Utilities to Undergo 
Competitive Selection Process in Securing Power Supply Agreements (PSAs)”. To implement the 
policy, the DOE and ERC jointly issued Resolution No. 1, “A Resolution Enjoining All Distribution 
Utilities to Conduct CSP in the Procurement of Supply for Their Captive Market” in October 2015. 
Further, ERC issued Resolution Nos. 13 Series of 2015, “A Resolution Directing All Distribution 
Utilities (DUs) to Conduct a Competitive Selection Process (CSP) in the Procurement of Their Supply 
to the Captive Market” and ERC Resolution Nos. 1 Series of 2016, “A Resolution Clarifying the 
Effectivity of ERC Resolution No. 13, Series of 2015”. A DOE-ERC Technical Working Group (TWG) was created to work on drafting the implementing 
guidelines on the CSP Policy.
Privatization of Government’s Power Sector Assets
The privatization of the government’s power facilities is one of the key features of EPIRA and a 
prerequisite to the establishment of a level playing field in the power industry. The period 2010-
2016 saw the turn-over of majority of the National Power Corporation’s major generation assets, IPP 
contracts and transmission assets. 
As of September 2016, the privatization level of National Power Corporation (NPC) generating assets 
in Luzon and Visayas reached 93.5 percent while for total Philippines, it stood at 71.8 percent having 
privatized a total of 4,473 MW out 6,234 MW. With respect to IPP contracts, privatized capacities 
include the contracted capacities for Sual and Pagbilao coal-fired thermal power plants, San Roque, 
Bakun, and Benguet mini hydroelectric power plants and the Ilijan Natural Gas Combined Cycle 
Power Plant, and Unified Leyte GPP-Strips of Energy. This is equivalent to 77.46 percent of the total 
NPC contracted energy output in Luzon and Visayas thereby marking the completion of the five 
preconditions for the implementation of RCOA.
Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) 
The establishment of WESM is part of the package of electric power industry reforms mandated by 
EPIRA where trading of electricity through a transparent and competitive process can be made. 
Following several months of trial operations, the WESM commenced commercial operations in the 
Luzon grid in 2006 while WESM officially commenced operations in the Visayas grid in 2010. 
The need for further augmenting the power supply in the Visayas region necessitated the integration 
of the Visayas in the WESM. Further, Luzon and Visayas provide market signals to potential 
investors in the region making it more efficient and a competitive power trading system, and would 
allow for the optimization of the energy flow between the two regions. As of 25 September 2016, 
the integrated WESM (Luzon and Visayas) has a total of 276 registered participants comprised of 105 
generating companies and 171 customers comprised of sixteen (16) Private DUs, 71 ECs, 79 Bulk 
users, and five (5) Wholesale Aggregators. 
On the other hand, to ensure the competitiveness of the WESM, the DOE promulgated policies and 
continue on closely supervising its operations and governance. As of November 2016, the DOE has 
provided the policies for the implementation of new WESM Design primarily the change from the 
one (1) – hour trading interval to five (5) minutes trading interval, the removal of minimum stable 
loading constraints, preparation for the reserve market and automation of several features of the 
Market Management System (MMS) to improve transparency and competition in the WESM. The 
Philippine Electricity Market Corporation (PEMC) is already in the process of determining 
appropriateness and compliance of the New Market Management Systems (NMMS) to the rules of 
the new WESM design. The DOE on the other hand has promulgated amendments to the WESM 
Rules for this purpose. Retail Competition and Open Access (RCOA) 
The implementation of RCOA is pursuant to Section 31 of Republic Act No. 9136 or the EPIRA where 
Contestable Customers (CC) will be allowed to source their supply of electricity from a Retail 
Electricity Supplier (RES) by allowing the use of transmission and distribution systems and associated 
facilities, subject to the payment of transmission and distribution wheeling charges duly approved by 
the ERC. 
The initial phase of implementation started with electricity end-users with an average peak demand 
of at least 1MW and provided an interim option for CCs to remain with their franchised DUs as 
Captive Market. 
With roughly more than two years of implementation, challenges with respect to implementation 
were encountered such as difficulty of CCs to secure supply contracts, ensuring a level playing field 
for suppliers, and limited capacity for non-generator suppliers. As a counter-measure, the DOE 
issued Department Circular No. DC2016-04-0004 providing for the new timelines for the mandatory 
contestability of the CCs as follows: 
 Starting 26 June 2016, those Contestable Customers (CCs) with an average demand of 750 
and above for the last 12 months may voluntarily secure its power supply from a Retail 
Electricity Supplier (RES); 
 By 26 December 2016, all CCs with an average demand of 1 MW and above shall be required 
to source their supply from a licensed RES; 
 By 26 June 2017, all CCs with an average demand of below 1 MW to 750 kW for the last 12 
months shall secure their power supply from a licensed RES. At this point, Aggregators will 
also be allowed to serve electricity end-users with an aggregated demand of at least 750 kW. 
The uncertainty brought by court case filed by MERALCO over the issuances of DOE and ERC on 
RCOA prompted the latter to move the mandatory contestability date for customers with 1 MW 
demand and above to 26 February 2017. 
Missionary Electrification 
As defined in the EPIRA-IRR, Missionary Electrification is the provision of basic electricity service in 
Unviable Areas with the ultimate aim of bringing the operation of these areas to viability levels. 
These missionary areas are basically off-grid areas or Small Island and Isolated Grids (SIIG) which are 
not connected to the main grids of Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Section 70 of EPIRA mandates the 
NPC to perform missionary electrification function through its Small Power Utilities Group (SPUG) 
and shall be responsible for providing power generation and associated power delivery systems. The 
missionary electrification function is being funded from the revenues from sales in missionary areas 
from the universal charge (UCME) which is being collected from electricity end-users. By virtue of DOE Department Circular 2004-01-001, missionary areas have been declared open for 
private sector participation (PSP) consistent to the direction set forth by the EPIRA Law to privatize 
NPC-SPUG’s generating assets. This circular delineates the general guidelines for the selection of a 
New Power Provider (NPP) that will take-over the function of NPC-SPUG at the onset of the 
privatization of generation services in a missionary area. 
As of December 2015, there are 286 SIIGs across the country with total rated capacity of 406.107 
MW being supplied by 30 NPP/IPP/DU/Qualified Third Party (QTP) plants and 290 NPC-SPUG power 
plants. 
To meet the increasing demand in missionary areas which currently do not have private power 
providers, NPC undertakes necessary augmentation of capacity. In 2015, a total of 900kW capacity in 
Luzon has been added to the current rated capacity to augment the supply being delivered to over 
800,000 households in SPUG areas.
As of December 2015, there are seven areas with a total of 126.28 MW capacity which have 
successfully privatized their generation services and concurrently receive 24 hours of electricity 
service (Table 14).

Roadmap 
The DOE envisions to implement its policy thrusts and strategic directions which are geared towards 
full restructuring and reform of the electric power industry by 2030. For the four subsectors of the 
power industry: generation, transmission, distribution and supply, the DOE identifies its goals and 
strategies for implementation in the short-, medium-, and long-term planning horizons towards the 
holistic development of the sector. 
For the generation subsector, the DOE will remain firm to its mandate of ensuring power supply 
security, reliability, adequacy and sustainability by inducing more private investments and pursuing 
new technologies and emerging power supply sources. In pursuit of this, the transmission and 
distribution subsectors shall provide reliable infrastructure to be able to deliver the supply to endusers. These two sub-sectors are also expected to utilize advanced and efficient technologies and 
build energy-resilient infrastructure in the medium to long term planning horizon. For the supply 
subsector, the DOE will push for the attainment of full power market independence through the 
continuous issuance and implementation of policy guidelines on WESM and RCOA. Lastly, 
institutional and support mechanisms will be in place to attain the objectives for each subsector. 
Generation 
The DOE will continue to encourage and facilitate the timely completion and commercial power 
generation projects by formulating relevant policies and regulations that will enable full competition 
and improved transparency in the sector. DOE will also pursue a legislative framework that will declare power projects as projects of national 
significance. By doing so, the tedious process for permitting and approval prior to the commercial 
operation of power generation projects will be streamlined; hence, the delivery of the much needed 
capacities to meet the country’s growing demand and minimize transaction costs. It also aims to 
address tax concerns of power companies to make the cost of electricity competitive. 
As part of its major policy thrusts, the DOE is also set to prioritize the institutionalization of a fuel 
mix policy for power generation towards optimal portfolio at 70-20-10 baseload, mid-merit and 
peaking power plant categories to meet 24/7 electricity demand and reserve requirement with 
spatial and sectoral dimensions. Along with these initiatives, the DOE will continue to facilitate 
privatization of NPC/PSALM-owned power generating facilities and enjoin existing generating 
companies to undertake repowering, rehabilitation and upgrading of their existing power plants to 
facilitate maximum operation of their facilities. The Department also plans to support accreditation 
mechanism of Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) process for contractor companies 
to ensure the highest degree of quality of power plants in compliance with international standards 
starting from the construction phase. 
The DOE has initiated and will continue regular performance assessment of power generation 
companies to determine and remove bottlenecks and inefficiencies in their operations. This will 
serve as the basis for benchmarking and identification of appropriate policies for the generation 
sector. 
Figure 25a. 2016-2030 ROADMAP OF THE POWER SECTOR (GENERATION)In the long term, the DOE will encourage and facilitate the entry of new and emerging power 
generation options such as nuclear technology, energy storage technologies, fuel cells and ocean 
thermal energy conversion (OTEC), among others. To make this happen, the DOE will establish 
strong cooperation among government line agencies such as the Department of Science and 
Technology (DOST) and Philippine Nuclear Research Institute (PNRI) and reinforce partnership with 
private research institutions which undertakes research, development and demonstration (RD&D) 
on energy technologies. 
The DOE supports the national strategy for technology development and efficiency in the power 
supply sector which are geared towards the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other 
pollutants. 
Transmission 
The timely completion and commissioning of transmission infrastructure necessary to deliver 
electricity to end-users remains a priority of the DOE along with the continuous upgrading, 
rehabilitation, and expansion of existing transmission lines, substations and other related facilities. 
Under the supervision of the National Transmission Corporation (TransCo), the NGCP who holds the 
franchise right to manage and operate the transmission assets is expected to continuously enhance 
its formulation of the Transmission Development Plan and conduct of the System Impact Study (SIS) 
to further improve the operation, reliability, and integrity of the transmission system. Conclusively, 
the NGCP must have adequate capacities for reserve to ensure uninterrupted power supply. Similar 
Figure 25b. 2016-2030 ROADMAP OF THE POWER SECTOR (TRANSMISSION)to the generation sector, DOE will likewise conduct regular performance assessment and 
benchmarking of transmission facilities and operations to address inefficiencies and system 
congestions. 
Apart from the continuing activities underlining transmission system improvement, TransCo and 
NGCP will jointly undertake the identification and development of new and alternative transmission 
corridors to lessen if not eliminate line congestions in view of the increasing demand. The VisayasMindanao interconnection is targeted to be implemented by 2020. Among the large SPUG Areas, 
Mindoro is planned to be interconnected to the Luzon Grid via Batangas within the medium-term. 
In the long-term, the integration of other large SPUG areas such as Palawan and Siquijor to the main 
grid is envisioned to be operational before the 2040 timeline. In view of the country’s vulnerability 
to climate change, the power sector shall be able to cope up with the increasing incidents of natural 
calamities through the development and construction of energy and climate-resilient transmission 
infrastructure and adoption of energy resiliency programs. 
Distribution 
For the short-term period, the Department will focus on increasing the capacities of DUs, particularly 
ECs, in formulating their respective DDP). The DOE together with the National Electrification 
Administration will continue to assist and supervise ECs on their institutional strengthening 
programs. The Department will also continue to strengthen its coordination with the Energy 
Regulatory Commission (ERC) and formulate enabling policies and joint resolutions to facilitate the 
timely approval and implementation of distribution facilities through CAPEX provisions, among 
others, to further improve the services being provided by DUs to their customers. Moreover, the full 
implementation and conduct of the Competitive Selection Process (CSP) and aggregation of DUs 
shall instill transparency and competition in securing Power Supply Agreements (PSAs) to ensure 
adequacy of supply at the least cost. The DUs, both grid and off-grid, will also be subjected to regular 
performance assessment and benchmarking to address operational and financial inefficiencies and 
institutional issues. 
In the medium to long term, DUs are mandated to undertake continuous upgrade and expansion of 
distribution infrastructure in their respective franchise areas. The sector shall utilize smart grid 
technologies (e.g. prepaid electricity, etc.) and invest in more efficient technologies. Further, the 
distribution sector shall likewise move towards the transformation of its current system and 
infrastructure to an energy-resilient one. 
Supply 
Within the short-term horizon, the mandatory contestability of electricity end-users having an 
average demand of 1 MW and above will be on 26 February 2017 while by end of 2017 for those 
electricity end-users with average demand of below 750 kW and above effective 2017. Retail 
aggregation will be implemented as well upon ERC’s promulgation of the requisite guidelines that 
will ensure its proper implementation. In the short-term, RCOA in Mindanao will be pursued 
following the implementation of WESM in Mindanao. For the medium-term, together with the ERC, the feasibility of lowering the threshold to 500 kW will 
be studied and implemented including aggregation for the same threshold. 
Market Development 
On the enhancement of the WESM design, while PEMC already completed the systems 
development, it will continue to conduct trainings and capacity building for the market participants 
and perform system trials. The NMMS will be fully operationalized by June 2017 including the 
features for demand side bidding and reserve market. 
Preparatory activities for the eventual establishment of a competitive electricity market in Mindanao 
are also underway given the need to manage and address expected dispatch and pricing issues 
arising from the full commercial operation of committed capacities in Mindanao resulting to excess 
supply in the grid. The systems requirements for the Mindanao market will already be part of the 
NMMS. 
The groundwork for the appointment of the Independent Market Operator has been done, thus, 
what is needed for the short-term is to be able to endorse the IMO in collaboration with the 
electricity power industry participants and in accordance with the legal framework provided by the 
Figure 25c. 2016-2030 ROADMAP OF THE POWER SECTOR (DISTRIBUTION AND SUPPLY)EPIRA. The IMO will assume the functions and responsibilities of the Autonomous Group Market 
Operator (AGMO). 
The privatization of the remaining NPC generating plants, NPP-IPP contracts and decommissioned 
assets in will continue to be pursued by PSALM subject to guidance and directives of the DOE 
considering supply-demand situation specifically in the Mindanao grid. Mindanao Electricity Market 
will be implemented in 2017 to establish central dispatch system to optimize available capacities. 
The market will also provide price and other techno-economic signals that will further encourage 
investments in additional capacities in the region. To complement this, the DOE will also look into 
harmonizing policies on embedded generation to ensure optimal use. 
Included in the short-term, the DOE is envisioning: (1) co-optimized reserve and energy market that 
would allow more transparent supply and pricing in the WESM enhancing supply reliability; and (2) 
Renewable Energy Market to complement the implementation Renewable Portfolio Standards and 
allow the trading of Green Certificates as a mechanism for compliance to the RPS. 
 
In the short to medium-term, the DOE will also work on the: (1) Smart Grid policy to provide 
technological support and innovations that would enhance various market developments; and (2) 
demand-side bidding in the WESM. 
Figure 25d. 2016-2030 ROADMAP OF THE POWER SECTOR (MARKET DEVELOPMENT AND INSTITUTIONAL AND SUPPORT 
MECHANISM)In the long-term, new electricity market products such as Forwards Market, Financial Transmission 
Rights, Day-Ahead Market and Derivatives Market will be introduced to encourage new investments 
by promoting greater liquidity, transparency and efficiency in the market. 
Institutional and Support Mechanism 
The implementation of institutional and other support mechanism will continue to be a main pillar 
of the DOE’s initiatives to ensure the attainment of the EPIRA objectives and realize the shortmedium-long term market development goals. Among others, the priorities are: (1) intensification of 
IEC Campaign at the grass roots level, supported by the different Attached Agencies and the PEMC 
thru conduct of focus trainings and fora; (2) continuing improvements in WESM operations thru 
rules review and changes, conduct of WESM audits, monitoring of Market Operator performance 
and compliance to WESM Rules; (3) establishment of the DOE’s Electric Power Database 
Management Systems that would support the various policy initiatives providing analysis and 
numerical basis; (4) continuing capacity building for DOE personnel to be able to cope up with the 
dynamic nature of the power industry; and, (5) ensuring compliance to the various requirements of 
the EPIRA and related laws.
On the technical aspect, the DOE will continue to embark on capacity building and enhance its 
expertise through the use of advanced planning tools and establishment of a robust database 
management system which shall aid in policy formulation. Likewise, the DOE will also ensure that all 
the necessary information on the electric power industry will be communicated to the public 
through an intensified Information, Education and Communication Campaign and attendance to 
various fora, dialogs and consultations.
Missionary Electrification
Consistent to the mandate of DOE to craft policies that will redound to a sustainable energy sector, 
the roadmap for missionary electrification aims to present a strategic direction for its continuous 
development in terms of energy security and its associated systems, private sector investment, 
institutional partnerships, operational efficiency and existing policies and regulations. To attain such, 
the roadmap of missionary electrification is divided into three phases namely, short-term, medium 
term and long-term. 
Short Term 
As of June 2016, there are already seven (7) SIIGs that have successfully attained the privatization of 
its generation services. This turn-over of function redounds to the reduction of Missionary 
Electrification subsidy which in turn minimizes the cost incurred by the government. To further 
encourage the entry of private investors in missionary areas, DOE will amend Department Circular 
DC2004-01-001 to make it more fitting to the current progress of privatization in missionary areas. 
The amended circular will include, among others, the provision of guidelines in properly handling 
Swiss Challenge or unsolicited bidding that has been observed to increase from 2014 to 2016. 
Furthermore, it will also include necessary reiterations to further facilitate the efficient disposal of 
the remaining NPC-SPUG’s generating assets as also mandated by the EPIRA Law. On the other hand, tourism zones or eco-zones in missionary areas will also be determined and included in the 
Missionary Electrification Development Plan (MEDP) as these areas, if thoroughly studied, can pave 
the way for an influx of private investment. As a corollary, a list of priority investment areas will also 
be created to mainstream the potential of missionary areas and boost the privatization in leastdeveloped regions. 
To forward robust private sector participation, DOE in coordination with the NEA will determine, 
publicize and monitor the needed additional capacities of Electric Cooperatives that are needed to 
be bid out as projected at least until 2020. This will in turn give interested investors a bird’s eye view 
of available packets for investment. On the other hand, to facilitate the efficient and centralized 
consolidation of this kind of information, a Missionary Electrification Database System will be 
implemented that will include, among others, information from the reportorial requirements of 
Electric Cooperatives and Generation Companies as well as relevant data from NPC and NEA. It will 
also be imperative to enjoin Electric Cooperatives in missionary areas to religiously fill-out their 
Distribution Development Plan to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the needed information 
in the database. 
On the supply side, an optimal energy mix will also be studied and implemented to ensure that offgrid areas are also synchronized with the direction being taken by our stakeholders from the 
national grid. At the advent of the country-scale utilization of renewable energy and its significant 
entry to the energy mix, the Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) will also be effected through a 
holistic approach that will not only meet the optimal energy mix but will also address the current 
infrastructural peculiarity of off-grid areas. 
On institutional level, the coordination among DOE, NEA, NPC and other concerned agencies will be 
strengthened to effectively monitor the components of missionary electrification. Competitive 
Figure 25e.2. 2016-2030 ROADMAP OF THE POWER SECTOR (MISSIONARY ELECTRIFICATION)Selection Process (CSP) of Electric Cooperatives will continue to be monitored and improved to 
ensure its integrity, transparency and success. Concerned government agencies will continue to 
extend necessary assistance to Electric Cooperatives to assure that they will attain mutually 
beneficial supply contracts. To further monitor the distribution side, the Philippine Small Grid 
Guidelines (PSGG) compliance monitoring will be implemented, in coordination with the Distribution 
Management Committee (DMC), with an objective to benchmark minimum operational efficiency 
among off-grid Electric Cooperatives. Transmission projects of NPC will also be recorded and 
monitored to ensure its timely implementation. In coordination with the Power Sector Assets and 
Liabilities Management (PSALM), the collection, disbursement and expenditure of UC-ME will also be 
examined to aid DOE in determining essential policy directions that will include its rationalization 
and graduation. 
NPC-SPUG and new power providers (NPPs) in missionary areas will also be subjected to 
performance assessment to determine the effectiveness of private sector participation in off-grid 
areas. 
Medium Term 
With operational plans already in place in the preceding term, this phase will continue to reinforce 
missionary electrification and its associated components. An Investment Portfolio (IP) for missionary 
areas will be crafted to further boost the influx of private investment. This portfolio may include, 
among others, the system of island clustering for the expediency of aggregated supply and a 
compendium of potential tourism pathways to make missionary areas more appealing to large-scale 
power providers. Existing RE policies will also be reviewed to assess its effectiveness in the context 
of RE generation and reduction of government subsidy in missionary areas. 
To improve the delivery of power to our end-users from generation to distribution, transmission and 
distribution lines upgrade shall continue in this phase which will then be duly monitored by DOE. 
DOE will undertake measures to ensure the timely implementation of these projects. Capacitybuilding workshops and seminars for Electric Cooperatives will also be conducted to assist them in 
conducting energy planning and demand management. We will also identify and lay-out institutional 
support and strategies to help Electric Cooperatives increase their operational efficiency which will 
eventually redound to reduction of losses and electricity rates. Through the EU-ASEP Technical 
Assistance, we will craft a uniform format of Power Supply Agreements (PSA) that is equitable and 
beneficial to both power distributor and generator. Given the peculiarity of the electricity system in 
off-grid areas, stable and sufficient supply of power should be assured. On the generation side, the 
guidelines to govern Plant Use and Losses (PUAL) and Fuel Rate (FR) of NPC-SPUG and NPPs will be 
crafted with the primary objective to improve and maximize the operations and functionality of their 
power plants. This will also serve as benchmark for incoming power providers to guarantee safe and 
efficient supply of power for consumers. 
As a particular project, the Interconnection of Mindoro Island (Batangas-Mindoro Interconnection 
Project) to the main grid will be implemented in the medium-term as already laid out in the 
submitted 2014-2015 Transmission Development Plan of NGCP. Long Term 
In the long run, we envision to bring the operations in missionary areas to viability levels as directed 
by existing laws and policies. Putting into operations the previously mentioned action plans, 
transmission projects formerly determined and implemented by NPC should have already been 
completed during this phase. This will guarantee a stable and efficient backbone for the delivery of 
power from the generation company to the distribution facility. Additionally, majority of the SIIGs 
currently served by NPC-SPUG will have 24/7 supply of power which will be specifically set out and 
scheduled in NPC’s annual Missionary Electrification Development Plan (MEDP). 
Efforts to significantly reduce government subsidy in missionary areas will also be undertaken. 
Hybridization of NPC-SPUG’s diesel power plants with renewable energy will be explored and 
adopted as a feasible option to reduce fuel and operational cost. As a corollary, implementation of 
two-tier/multi-tier SAGR/SARR should also be in place to make electricity rates more equitable to 
different types of customers. Interconnection to the grid of large islands (Palawan, Siquijor, etc.) will 
also be facilitated in sync with the continuous evolvement of the TDP. Moreover, interconnection of 
adjacent island grids through submarine cable connections will also be facilitated to further 
encourage the entry of large-scale private power providers. Finally, a holistic UCME graduation 
policy will be crafted and executed to be effected on areas that have already achieved an acceptable 
level of viability. 
Action Plan
To realize the goals set forth in this roadmap, the Department will execute the following strategies: 
 Advocate the passage of a legislative measure that will declare energy projects as projects of 
national significance to ensure timely implementation of power projects 
 Institutionalize an appropriate power portfolio (70-20-10 baseload, mid-merit and peaking 
categories) and reserve requirements 
 Provide policy guidance and directives to the energy family through formulation of more 
stringent and sound policies 
 Continuous updating, improvement and timely execution of the Power Development Plan, 
Transmission Development Plan, Distribution Development Plan, Missionary Electrification 
Development Plan and Household Electrification Development Plan 
 Continuous monitoring, inspection and conduct of technical performance audit of power 
facilities to ensure the security and reliability of supply 
 Continuous monitoring and implementation of EPIRA  Institutionalize performance standards to all energy regulatory and market related agencies 
of government 
 Publish synchronized maintenance schedule of power plants 
 Continuous conduct of capacity building activities for the energy family and industry 
stakeholders to increase technical competency 
 Continuous conduct of research, development and deployment of emerging and innovative 
technologies 
 Intensify public awareness through the conduct of information, education and 
communication campaigns 
ELECTRIFICATION
Overview 
The Government is cognizant on the importance of bringing electricity access to energy-poverty 
stricken areas in the country. As a conduit to progress, electricity access is interlinked with 
advancing the quality of life, delivering the basic and essential services, improving productivity and 
fostering economic prosperity. It also directly impacts education as children and youth in 
unelectrified areas are able to reap the benefits of electricity access by having longer study hours in 
their homes. This has been the Government’s guiding framework in its electrification efforts and 
initiatives that cover barangays, households and sitios (refers to an administrative unit at the local 
level which is traditionally used to name the location of remote cluster of households living outside 
the barangay proper). 
For the 2016-2030 planning horizon, the electrification goals that will serve as guideposts for the 
sector are: (i) 90 percent household electrification by 2017; (ii) 100 percent/total household 
electrification by 2020; (iii) continuing implementation of NEA’s sitio electrification.
Consistent with the electrification goals of the PEP, the energy sector is also guided with the nine (9)-
point program of the Administration to pursue 100 percent electrification of targeted households in 
all three (3) major islands. 
Status of Electrification 
The barangay was the starting point for the program but focus shifted on energizing households in 
201022
. Electrification at the household level increased from 79.7 percent in 2010 to 89.6 percent in 
 
22 The shift to electrification at the household level from the barangay was one of the objectives stated under DC No. 2003-04-004 signed 
by then DOE Secretary Vincent S. Perez.July 2016. This shows that that 20,360,334 out of the potential 22,721,430 households are already 
enjoying electricity access. 
Electrification on a grid level shows that Luzon has the highest household electrification level at 94.8 
percent followed by Visayas at 92.4 percent and Mindanao with 72.4 percent. On a per region basis, 
the National Capital Region (NCR) has the highest household electrification level at 98.3 percent 
(3,451,303 out of the 3,512,439 potential households already with electricity access). In Visayas and 
Mindanao, Region 7 (Central Visayas) and Region XIII (CARAGA) registered the highest electrification 
levels at 95.9 percent and 93.8 percent respectively. ARMM remains as the least electrified region in 
the country in terms of households having only 38.7 percent electrification level or 199,373 
energized households out of the potential 514,592 (Table 16).

Coordinating the Government’s overall electrification efforts is the Household Unified Strategic 
Electrification (HOUSE) Team. It was created by virtue of Department Circular (DC) 2014-09-0018 
issued in 29 September 2014. DOE chairs the team with NEA and NPC sitting as co-chairs. Members 
that comprise the HOUSE team include representatives coming from DOE, NEA, NPC-SPUG, DBM and DILG. Ensuring that the Government attains its 90 percent household electrification by 2017 is one 
of the Team’s key functions.
The HOUSE team will assist in the implementation of all policy measures and strategies as well as the 
management and monitoring of all the programs and activities under HEDP. 
There are several sub-program components aiding the Government’s umbrella program of 
household electrification. These programs are delineated in terms of target or focus areas i.e. grid 
or off-grid and are all contributing and in support to the overall goal of attaining 90% household 
electrification by 2017. 
 Grid Electrification 
1. Sitio Electrification Program (SEP) 
In 2011, NEA established the Sitio Electrification Program (SEP) wherein the commitment was to 
energize 32,44123 sitios. From the onset of SEP in 2011 to March 2016, NEA was able to surpass its 
target by energizing 32,688 sitios translating to 100.8 percent accomplishment in the SEP Roadmap 
(Table 17).

2. Barangay Line Enhancement Program (BLEP) 
One of NEA’s programs that focuses only on those off-grid barangays that are already economically 
feasible for distribution line extension. 
From 2011 to 2015, 619 barangays benefitted from the program with a total program cost of PhP 
1,814.53 million. For 2016, 176 were targeted. As of 30 September 2016, 65 barangays were 
already energized, 81 were completed and 30 were undergoing construction. Following are the 
interventions used to extend the distribution line to the targeted BLEP areas: (i) submarine cables 
and (ii) improvement of tapping points (upgrading the distribution lines to be able to further extend 
the distribution line). 
 
23 The 32,441 sitios was the inventory of unenergized sitios (71,048 out of 103,489) submitted by NEA to DBM in 2011. The 
figure was adopted as the target for the SEP under the Aquino Administration. It is also based on NEA’s Status of Sitio 
Electrification as of 30 June 20113. Energy Regulations (ER) 1-9424
The Department serves as the Administrator of ER 1-94 which has three (3) fund components –
electrification fund (EF), development and livelihood fund (DLF), and reforestation, watershed 
management, health and/or environment enhancement fund (RWMHEEF) – utilized by host 
communities to promote growth and advancement in their respective areas. In the electrification 
program, DOE shall effectively administer EF of ER 1-94 in bringing electricity to all households, 
prioritizing the host cities/municipalities by implementing both grid and off-grid electrification 
projects. 
The DOE is currently undertaking the “Rationalization of ER 1-94 Electrification Fund towards Total 
Household Electrification of Host Communities.” It profiles host communities and identifies 
electrification projects in these areas to aid in achieving total household electrification. A total of 
259 host communities (144 in Luzon, 53 in Visayas and 62 in Mindanao) were already identified 
based on the current list of installed generation facilities in the country. 
As for the completed projects funded under EF, around 1,258 (1,218 are grid and 40 are off-grid) 
sitios/barangays with an equivalent household connection of 30,332 were energized from 2011 –
July 2015. The total approved project cost for these sitios/barangays was at PhP 1,408.5 million. For 
2016-2017, the Department targets 462 grid sitios and 22 off-grid sitios. 
4. Nationwide Intensification of Household Electrification (NIHE) 
The NIHE is one of DOE’s locally-funded projects (LFP). Approved in 2014, the project will run for 
three (3) years (2015-2017). It has the objective of developing and implementing specific measures 
and financial incentives (i.e. grant assistance) to mobilize DUs in fast-tracking connections of their 
remaining unelectrified households. 
For the grant assistance, the program shall provide house-wiring subsidy amounting to PhP 3,750 to 
poor and qualified household situated to areas/sitios where the distribution lines of the DU is 
physically available. In 2015, the DOE approved a total of 32,512 household beneficiaries with a 
total amount of PhP 114.42 million and will be implemented by 22 participating DU’s. For 2016, DOE 
targeted a total of 172,500 household beneficiaries while for 2017, 183,000 household beneficiaries 
were targeted. 
For 2016, of the total targeted households (172,500), 176,995 households were approved under the 
program with a total cost of PhP 667.33 million. 
Also, the DOE has successfully conducted a 9-Leg series of NIHE Project Development Workshop with 
Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao DUs. The said workshop provided the interested DUs the information 
to effectively implement the program in their franchise areas. 
 
 
24 DOE ensures that communities hosting generating facilities or energy resource development projects are benefitted thru ER 
1-94This is provided for by Section 5 (i) of RA 7638
Section 66 of RA 9136 and Rule 29 of the EPIRA-IRRAside from the grant assistance provided to qualified household beneficiaries, the NIHE programs 
also aims to provide the followingTechnical assistance (i)Streamlining of connection process; (ii) 
LGU-DU partnership for assistance in connection permits; and (iii) Policy support to address the issue 
of slum electrification and flying connections, among others.
 Off-Grid Electrification
1. Household Electrification Program (HEP) using renewable energy (RE) systems 
The HEP involves the energization of off-grid households using mature RE technologies which 
includes photovoltaic solar home system (PV-SHS), PV streetlights and micro-hydro systems. 
 
From 2011 to 2015, a total of 22,904 off-grid households gained electricity access thru the program. 
In 2016, the program targeted 1,679 households and installation is on-going on these identified 
beneficiaries. 
2. Solar PV Mainstreaming (under Access to Sustainable Energy Program or ASEP) 
The program will encourage DUs in implementing SHS mainstreaming/fee-for-service approach for 
dispersed households and highly remote areas in their franchise areas. This actually serves as one of 
the innovative service delivery mechanisms that DUs can execute for providing electricity access to 
remote, sparse and dispersed households. 
Further, the issuance of Department Circular (DC) No. 2014-007-0012 in 3 July 2014 entitled 
Accelerating Household Electrification in Off-Grid and Isolated Areas through Electricity Supply by 
Regulated Solar Home Systems prescribed the policies for DUs provision of electric service. 
Based on the pilot implementation of the Project in 2010-2014, the DOE pursued the scaled up 
implementation of the same through the “Philippines: Access to Sustainable Energy Program (ASEP)” 
with funding assistance from the European Union. For the next 4 years (2016-2019) the PV 
Mainstreaming program will be assisted by ASEP funding to implement a total of 51,400 household 
using the PV SHS. 
3. Qualified Third Party (QTP) Program 
The EPIRA and its IRR provides for the role of a qualified third party (QTP) in areas deemed unviable 
and waived by DUs. The QTP is responsible for generation of power and its distribution to the 
community. 
Currently, the operating QTP in the country is PowerSource Philippines Inc. (PSPI) in Brgy. Rio-Tuba, 
Palawan providing 24/7 electricity services to 1,744 households. Meanwhile, PSPI’s Malapascua’s 
QTP Project in Malapascua Island, Logon, DaanBantayan, Cebu was granted by the Energy 
Regulatory Commission (ERC) a provisional authority to operate as QTP in the island. It started 
operation in 2014 and is servicing 771 households. Other proposed projects under development or currently being proposed are: 1) Liminangcong, 
Taytay, Palawan and 2) Brgy. Cabayugan, Puerto Princesa City. 
The DOE expects to receive the technical and financial proposals for the potential QTPs for the 
following areas: (1) sixty-six (66) Sitios in the Province of Apayao; (2) Lahuy Island, Municipality of 
Caramoan, Camarines Sur (with 4 barangays, namely Gata, Oring, Daraga, and Gogon); (3) Haponan 
Island in the same Municipality; (4) Quinasalag Island in the Municipality of Garchitorena, Camarines 
Sur (with 8 barangays, as follows: Dangla, Binagasbasan, Burabod, Cagamutan, Mansangat, 
Tamiawon, Cagnipa, and Sumaoy); and, (5) Semirara Island in the Municipality of Caluya, Antique 
(with 3 barangays). 
To support the program, the DOE shall issue a revised policy guidelines for QTP project 
implementation that simplifies the process for project approval especially for those projects that 
employ RE Systems. 
Roadmap 
To attain the goal of 90.0 percent household electrification by 2017 (Figure 26), the Government is 
targeting a total of 828,06525 households from 2016 to 2017. Table 18 highlights the targets on a per 
sub-program component.

Note: Targets are referenced on the December 2015 HH Electrification Level
For 2016, 358,415 grid households are targeted for electrification while off-grid households that will 
benefit from electricity services totals 28,278. By 2017, 404,256 households will be energized thru 
grid electrification while off-grid electrification solutions will cover 37,616 households. Around 43.0 
percent of the total targeted households from 2016-2017 will be covered by the NIHE Project. 
NEA for its part will continue to implement its Total Electrification Plan (TEP). Their mandate of 
pursuing total electrification thru the ECs by enhancing distribution development including 
missionary areas was strengthened with RA 10531 or the NEA Reform Act of 2013. NEA is guided 
with their vision of total electrification of an area coverage basis by 2020. The TEP includes NEA’s 
program for sitio electrification since this will continue even after the Aquino Administration. For 
2016-2017, NEA has identified 3,150 and 6,321 sitios respectively (Figure 26). The 3,150 sitios are for 
implementation in 2016 and is apart from the already accomplished commitment from the 
Administration. Having accomplished their commitment under the SEP, NEA will still energize an 
additional 3,150 sitios in 2016. For 2017, NEA intends to provide electricity to 6,321 emerging sitios 
with approved appropriations from DBM in the amount of Php 1,817 billion. In the medium term 
(2018-2020), NEA targets to energize an average of 4,000 sitios. 
Action Plan 
 In achieving 100 percent electrification at the household level. The policy may entail 
specifying a reference base year and a base number of households to be targeted (such was 
applied in both barangay and sitio electrification programs).  Establishing a coordinated monitoring strategy for the attainment of 90 percent household 
electrification by 2017. One of the strategies is the provision of a monthly accomplishment 
report to keep track of program (including sub-program) accomplishments vs. targets. 
 Establishment of a household electrification information system (HEIS) that will aid in 
avoiding potential duplication of beneficiaries. 
 Establishment of Nationwide Off-grid database that will serve as baseline and target of all 
off-grid electrification program of the Government. 
 Assessment of previous off-grid electrification programs as this may serve as input to NEA’s 
BLEP. 
 Coordination with other government agencies that may assist in fast-tracking electrification. 
 Implementation of NEA’s Total Electrification Plan (TEP) by 2020.
 Address the issues and challenges identified by NEA in its SEP implementation such as (i) 
delay in program implementation because of peace and order situation in isolated areas; (ii) 
frequent occurrence of natural calamities; and (iii) accessibility problems in constructing the 
electric distribution system. 
ENERGY REGULATIONS (ER) 1-94
Overview 
The DOE ensures that financial benefits redound to communities hosting energy generating facilities 
or energy resource development projects. Through E.R. 1-94, communities are able to instigate 
development by accessing three (3) fund types – electrification fund (EF), development and livelihood 
fund (DLF) and reforestation, watershed management, health and/or environment enhancement 
fund (RWMHEEF). The accrued financial benefits that emanated from the validated electricity sales 
of generation facilities, generation companies and/or energy resource developers operating in host 
communities has already reached PhP 10.74 billion as of 31 December 2016. Utilizing their 
respective shares to promote growth in their areas, the total approved amount for the various 
projects implemented by host communities was pegged at PhP 6.85 billion. The remaining PhP 3.89 
billion can still be accessed by these communities to fund various projects that may be classified in 
any of the three (3) fund types under E.R. 1-94 (Table 19). Table 19. SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL BENEFITS UNDER E.R. 1-94 (June 1995 – 31 December 2016)

Commencing in June 1995, ER 1-94 has already been able to fund 6,734 projects with an equivalent 
amount of PhP 6.85 billion as of December 31, 2016. Fifty-eight percent or 3,907 of all approved 
projects are mostly electrification related and this can be associated with the Government’s intent of 
increasing electricity access at the household and sitio level throughout the country (Table 20). 
Meanwhile, projects funded by DLF and RWMHEEF totaled 1,481 and 1,346 respectively. 
Approved E.R. 1-94 Projects in 2016 are highlighted in Table 21. Seven (7) electrification projects 
were approved under EF amounting to PhP 139.48 million. 
For DLF, 90 projects were approved equivalent to PhP 56.97 million. These projects proposed by 
host communities ranged from construction (e.g. day care centers, road shoulder, classrooms, 
drainage systems, community stage, cemetery shed, tire path, waiting shed) to 
rehabilitation/improvement (e.g. provincial road, footbridge, pathway, farm-to-market road) of 
various community-related infrastructures, equipment procurement (e.g. farm, office) and 
construction/installation of street lighting. The benefitting communities are located in the 
provinces of Batangas, Laguna, Bukidnon, Lanao doel Sur, Ifugao, Quezon, Pangasinan, Cebu, 
Benguet, Nueva Ecija, Samar, Misamis Occidental and Bataan.

domestic/barangay water supply system, birthing rooms, covered wash area, barangay health 
center and perimeter fence), procurement of vehicles/machines/equipment (e.g. wheel excavator, 
crawler excavator, bull dozer, dump truck, sterilizing machine, hospital and medical equipment, 
multi-purpose vehicle, cylinder water pumps, ambulance, disaster management equipment, and 
office equipment). The community beneficiaries of these projects are located in Batangas, Ilocos 
Sur, Pangasinan, Lanao del Sur, Bukidnon, Benguet, Cebu, Laguna, Nueva Ecija, Quezon, Aurora, 
Nueva Vizcaya and Bataan. 
The DOE is the Fund Administrator of ER 1-94 and is responsible in establishing specific trust 
accounts of each project by the generation companies and/or energy resource developers for the 
accrual of financial benefits.26 Since the onset of E.R. 1-94 up to December 2016, the DOE has 
established 907 trust accounts. In 2016 alone, a total of 65 trust accounts were opened by the 
Department. 
On-going efforts to effectively implement the ER1-94 program are: (i) continuing coordination with 
the ER 1-94 stakeholders to further improve the procedure and timely processing of all ER 1-94 
projects; (ii) conduct of study to enhance the allocation of ER 1-94 fund and make it more inclusive 
for other qualified beneficiaries such as indigenous people affected by power and energy projects; 
and (iii) support to all legislative initiatives including the revision of implementation structure of ER 
1-94 program towards the greater benefits of the communities hosting power plants and energy 
resource development. 
DOWNSTREAM OIL INDUSTRY 
Overview 
The Oil or Petroleum Industry in the Philippines is divided into two sectors: the upstream and 
downstream. The downstream sector involves the processing, selling, and distribution of natural gas 
and petroleum products. It also plays an integral part of fueling various industries (e.g. 
transportation and power). The country’s downstream sector is deregulated through Republic Act 
No. 8479, otherwise known as the Downstream Oil Industry Deregulation Act of 1998. The law calls 
for the creation of a competitive market anchored on fair and reasonable pricing, provision of high 
quality petroleum products and an encouraging market investment environment for industry players 
and investors. 
For the year 2015, Crude oil imports have increased 78,060 MB for 20.1 percent compared to 2014’s 
65,015. About 86 percent of the total crude mix (67,133 MB) originated from the Middle East, of 
which 51.28 percent (34,427 MB) was sourced from Saudi Arabia, the country’s major supplier of 
 
26 Rule 29 Section 5 of the EPIRA-IRR states that the DOE shall establish trust account specific for EF, DLF, RWMHEEF in the name 
of the DOE and the generation facilities or generation company and/or energy resource developer. Correspondingly, Section 7 
of Rule 29 specifies that the administration of EFDLFand RWMHEEF shall be undertaken by the Departmentcrude oil. Meanwhile, in terms of crude run and refinery production, the current maximum working 
crude distillation capacity of the country is 285 thousand barrels per stream day (MBSD). Refinery 
production for the year 2015 rose by 26.2 percent from 61,372 MB in 2014 to 77,478 MB. The 
growth was due to higher refinery utilization at 74.4 percent in 2015 compared to 59 percent in 
2014 as a result of extended emergency/ maintenance shutdown of some oil refineries. 
On the other hand, Importation of petroleum products as of 2015 reached 77,934 MB, an increase of 
11.9 percent from the previous year. This can be attributed to the increased import volume of 
naphtha and condensate, which are used as raw materials for petrochemical production and as 
replacement fuel for natural gas during the scheduled maintenance shutdown of the Malampaya gas 
facility. Total gasoline import reached 46.1 percent of gasoline demand while diesel oil import was 
48.3 percent of diesel demand. LPG import on the other hand, was 65.3 percent of LPG demand. 
Total product import was 54.4 percent of the total products demand. Meanwhile, a total of 1,954 
MB bioethanol was imported as blending component for gasoline, during the same period, which 
grew by about 11.7 percent from 2,214 MB of YTD September 2014. Pursuant to Republic Act No. 
9367 or Biofuels Law of 2007 all gasoline to be sold in the country should be E-10 (gasoline with 10 
percent bioethanol content), except for RON100 gasoline. 
As for the country’s petroleum product exports, an increase of 46.3 percent, from 9,561 MB in 2014 
to 13,988 MB in 2015, was recorded. Condensate, the top exported product for the period, dropped 
by 41.5 percent vis-à-vis in 2014. Naphtha exports meanwhile grew by 4.2 percent while fuel oil 
increased by 83.5 percent 
As of end December 2015, actual crudes and petroleum products closing inventory was recorded at 
18,006 thousand barrels (MB) or 45-day supply equivalent; 33 days for crude oil and products in 
country stocks and 12 days in-transit. This was lower by 4.8 percent from December 2014 level of 
17,180 MB. YTD December 2015 average inventory was recorded at 44 days, 34 days in country 
stock and 10 days in-transit. 
The government continues to enforce the Minimum Inventory Requirement (MIR) given the 
continuing risks faced by the downstream oil industry sector such as geopolitical instability and 
supply delivery problems to areas affected by calamities (e.g. typhoon, flood, earthquake, etc.). The 
current MIR for refiners is in-country stocks equivalent to 30 days while an equivalent of 15 days 
stock is required for the bulk marketers and 7 days for the LPG players. (Oil Supply Demand Report 
FY 2015) 
With regards to facilities and product standards, the DOE continuously sets and reviews standards to 
concretize its endeavor to harmonize the Philippine National Standard (PNS) with 
international/regional trends for quality of fuels, and petroleum facilities and processes, promote 
the use of efficient technologies, alleviate the country’s energy security concern and safeguard the 
health and welfare of the people. Since 2012, the following Philippine National Standards (PNS) for 
fuel quality and facilities were reviewed/updated, and were subsequently promulgated, by the DOEchaired Technical Committee on Petroleum Products and Additives (TCPPA), and the Technical 
Committee on Petroleum Processes and Facilities (TCPPF): Fuel Quality Standard 
 PNS/DOE QS 004:2012 – FAME blended diesel oils (B2) specification 
 PNS/DOE QS 008:2012 – E-Gasoline Fuel (E10) specification 
 PNS/DOE QS 007:2014 – Anhydrous bioethanol & bioethanol fuel (E100) specifications 
 PNS/DOE QS 002:2015 – Coconut methyl esters (B100) specification 
 PNS/DOE QS 010:2015 – High FAME blended diesel oils (B5) specification 
Facility Standard 
 PNS/DOE FS 8:2013 – Transportation of Petroleum Product by Pipeline 
 PNS/DOE FS 3:2013 – Auto LPG Dispensing Station 
 PNS/DOE FS 9:2015 – Code of Safety Practice in Auto LPG Dispensing Station 
Similarly, corresponding Department Circulars (DC) were issued to implement the above standards, 
particularly for fuel quality. 
Regarding the country’s oil demand, 2015 total demand of finished petroleum products grew by 15.0 
percent to 143,226 MB from 124,503 MB in 2014. This can be translated to an average daily 
requirement of 392.4 MB compared with last year’s level of 341.1 MB. The growth in demand was 
attributed to the increased demand of the power sector in particular demand for fuel oil, naphtha 
and condensate products vice natural gas, and for the transport fuels due to low prices. 
Roadmap 
Figure 27. 2016-2030 ROADMAP OF THE DOWNSTREAM OIL INDUSTRY In most cases, improvement of policy governing the downstream oil sector will be needed to meet 
the industry challenges and to encourage more private sector participation in the downstream oil 
industry thereby ensuring a sustainable supply of high quality and right quantity of petroleum 
products in the market. The following comprise the roadmap that will be useful towards the 
achievement of addressing these challenges: 
SHORT/MEDIUM TERM 
(1) Continuous Monitoring of the Downstream Oil Industry 
 Supply/Demand Situation 
The monitoring of the industry’s supply/demand situation is basically ensuring the oil 
companies’ compliance to the reportorial requirement of the Downstream Oil Deregulation 
Act and the Biofuels Act. This covers the entry of new players and verification of their 
facilities, accreditation to the bioethanol fuel program, crude oil/product imports (including 
bioethanol) and inventories, refinery production, product sales and exports, and LMA 
(required volume purchase of locally produce ethanol) setting and compliance. These 
information aid government regulators and policy makers to fully evaluate the industry for 
future policy direction. Prospective investors and existing players would also need these 
data to determine viability of future investments 
 Price Adjustments 
To ensure fair competition and prevent abuse of free market pricing, international and local 
petroleum prices should be continually monitored. Differences in local prices could signify 
level of competition in the area/region and lack of necessary infrastructure for accessibility. 
 Product Quality and Facility Standard Verification 
Standards on product quality and facility should be enforced for consumer and environment 
protection. These would help curb illegal activities such as adulteration and oil smuggling 
and illegal trading. The use of biofuels and the success of the program also depend on fuel 
quality monitoring. Product sampling and testing at the bulk plants and retail outlets are 
continuously conducted to ensure compliance to existing standards. 
 Retail Outlet Inspection, Licensing and Promotion 
Consumer protection is government’s basic concern. Continuous and vigorous inspection of 
retail outlets should be conducted on a consistent basis. This is to ensure that the 
consumers’ purchases of petroleum product are of standard quality and of right quantity. It 
also advocates consumer safety and equal playing field for industry players. 
All retail outlets should have valid licenses (COC for liquid fuels and SCC for LPG). 
Requirement for issuance of these licenses should always be reviewed and revised as 
needed. (2) Review and Possible Streamlining of Requirements for Entry and Operation of Players 
When the oil industry was deregulated, many of the licensing requirements of the industry were 
replaced by reportorial requirements. Even if the industry was so-called deregulated, voluminous 
documents and reports are still required to be submitted. To improve oil companies’ compliance and 
facilitate entry of players and investments, these requirements have to be reviewed and 
streamlined. 
(3) Review of Existing Rules and Regulations and Recommendations of Amendments 
Existing government rules and regulations for the downstream oil industry specifically those 
involving taxation, incentives, and licensing should be reviewed in order to attain the following: 
 Increasing Oil Infrastructure Investments. The importance of encouraging industry players 
for more investments as to ensure supply security, improve market competition and, 
consequently bring out reasonable prices. Subsequently, proposals towards changing the 
basic regulatory framework for the deregulated industry shall be pursued, specifically, the 
coordination with the LGUs with regards to the initiatives that affect the activities and/or 
entry of downstream activities in their respective areas. 
Notwithstanding the increased number of downstream oil industry participants, the 
government shall continue to invite/seek foreign investors to explore investing in oil 
refinery/facility. The said investment would provide a more stable and bigger supply base for 
the country. Moreover, an assessment of existing benefits for oil refineries and bigger 
appropriate recommendations without prejudice to direct product importers. 
 Upgrading of Technical Capability and Equipment. With the challenge of meeting the 
changing product quality and facility standard requirement, the technical capability and 
equipment of DOE should be upgraded as needed. This should include process and database 
management systems improvement, acquiring modern and reliable equipment, personnel 
training and certification for handling/operating testing equipment, and review of 
manpower capability requirement in view of the new developments in the industry. 
 Regular Updating of Oil Contingency Plan. Since the country’s oil requirement is practically 
sourced from other countries, local supply is basically vulnerable as we have no control over 
the factors that may affect it. This makes the oil contingency plan a necessity. The existing 
plan should be periodically updated to reflect the changes in supply/demand parameters 
and applicable scenarios and schemes to mitigate a reduction in supply, such as in 
emergency situations brought about by natural and man-made disasters 
 Conduct of IEC Programs. More IEC programs shall be conducted on the downstream oil 
industry and oil pricing for the academe and other stakeholders. Partnerships with other 
units shall also be pursued to increase awareness of the consumers, at the same time 
improving public perception of the benefits brought about by the deregulated environment 
– better product quality, wider choices, and greater competition. MEDIUM/LONG TERM 
(1) Ensuring the Country’s Oil Supply Security through Oil Stockpiling
 ASEAN Initiative 
Focus is currently given on the need to establish joint stockpile facilities in the Region. Thus, 
the Philippine government will continue to pursue collaboration with the other ASEAN 
countries in the establishment of regional petroleum stockpiles to form part of the 
government measures to ensure oil security. 
The DOE regularly participates in meetings of ASEAN Petroleum Security Agreement (APSA) 
Task Force and its activities such as emergency response exercise. 
There is a need to put up a mechanism on how to localize the operationalization of APSACoordinated Emergency Response Measures (CERM). A study on the set up of the 
mechanisms is recommended together with localization mechanism that should cover plans 
for both normal and in times of disruption. In line with this, the revisiting of the existing oil 
contingency plan is essential. 
 Domestic Strategic Oil Stockpile 
The government through the DOE or PNOC should initiate the conduct of studies on setting 
up and operating a “strategic” oil stockpile in the country. A strategic oil stockpile is oil 
sorted for local supply contingency purposes. This is on top of the commercial stockpile that 
the existing oil players (importers/refiners) are required to maintain. Aspects to be 
considered includes the type and quantity of oil, storage facilities, cost of putting up and 
operating the stockpile, timing of oil acquisition, conditions that would warrant a stockpile 
drawdown, and the entity who would manage the facility. 
(2) Continuance of Short/Medium Term Plan of Activities 
The monitoring of the activities in the downstream oil industry, review of existing rules, upgrading of 
technical capabilities, updating of plans, and intensified inspection and promotion campaigns should 
be a never-ending process. As long as the industry exists, the continuity of the said activities should 
always be implemented. 
(3) Fuel Quality Standard Development 
On the way forward for fuel quality standard development, the DOE is committed to keep abreast 
with international/regional trend, in collaboration with DENR’s policies on vehicle emission (EURO 5, 
6, etc.) and the introduction of other feedstock of biofuels and higher blends as evolving policy 
thrusts in the energy sector. To effectively assess the implementation of future energy policies and programs for the fuel sector, 
it is necessary that the underlying science, engineering, and economics are similarly given emphasis: 
1. EURO Emission (5, 6, etc.) – sulfur reduction level for gasoline and diesel is the primary 
parameter that needs to be addressed in developing fuel quality standard for Euro emission 
standards 
 Assessment of local refinery capability – configurations of refinery processes to meet the 
fuel specification requirement, refinery cost, and timetable for investments and 
completion. 
 Assessment of supply availability in the region. 
 Assessment in the harmonization with international/regional trend of fuel quality 
standard 
2. Biofuels and Higher Blends 
 Characterization of current and next generation feedstock. Lifecycle and economic cost of 
feedstock selection. 
 Assessment on supply availability vis-à-vis policy for higher blend mandate 
 Identifying critical properties affecting fuel quality (study on parameters which are doable 
to local conditions and requirements of the car manufacturers). 
Action Plan 
A. Updating of the Oil Supply Contingency Plan 
The current plan should be periodically updated to reflect the changes in supply/demand 
parameters and applicable scenarios and schemes to mitigate a reduction in supply. The strategies 
should include constant monitoring and forecasting the market developments well as preparation of 
emergency policies and procedures. The said plan should also look into local and international oil 
markets, international supply and demand, refinery facilities and price developments. 
B. Promoting the development/establishment of a national oil stockpile program 
The DOE will spearhead the development of policies for a National Oil Stockpile Program. This is to 
protect the country in cases of oil disruption caused by unwanted events (i.e. natural disasters, 
damaged pipelines, etc.) and severe increases in oil prices in the international market. 
C. Encouraging additional oil (and biofuels) infrastructure on storage and distribution 
Additional oil infrastructure is vital in transporting petroleum products from the refineries to the 
market all over the country. Ensuring the petroleum product’s safety to avoid any contamination 
from the variety of transport modes and distance would ensure of the product’s specifications and avoid its costly re-processing. Hence, sufficient infrastructures must be put in place for refiners to 
comply with the government’s stringent environmental regulation and product specifications
D. Oil refinery upgrading/expansion 
With the country’s limited refinery baseline, local refineries could barely meet the overall demand 
which results in the country having to import most of its petroleum requirements. The supply of 
petroleum products is prone to shortages. Hence, the government encourages investors to 
upgrade/expand storage facilities and construct new refineries to address these shortages in oil 
supply. 
E. Transparency of Oil Price Adjustments 
Ensuring fair prices in a deregulated environment is essential for fair competition. The DOE having 
no control over oil price movement in the market shall monitor and determine the reasonableness 
of oil prices. 
F. Promoting awareness through IEC 
Continuous IEC programs shall be conducted on the downstream oil industry and oil pricing for the 
academe and other stakeholders. This aims to empower consumers by providing basic information 
on the downstream oil activities. Subsequently, the DOE will continue its regular meetings with 
industry players and other stakeholders to address oil-related issues. 
G. Constant Monitoring of the industry 
Consumer protection is one of the utmost concerns of the government. As such, the DOE undertakes 
the following to safeguard the general public: 
1. Supply and Demand Situation 
This includes the entry of new players and verification of their facilities. The information also 
aids government regulators and policy makers to evaluate the industry for future policy 
direction. Investors and existing players would also need these data to determine viability of 
future investments. Existing players are also reminded of their compliance to the reportorial 
requirements as stated in RA 8479. 
2. Product Quality and Facilities Standard Verification 
Product sampling and testing are constantly conducted to ensure its compliance to 
standards. This would aid the government to eradicate smuggling and other illegal activities. 
3. Retail Outlet Inspection, Licensing and Promotion 
This would ensure that the consuming public purchases of petroleum products are of 
standard quality and right quantity. All retail outlets should have valid licenses for consumer 
safety and a level playing field. DOWNSTREAM NATURAL GAS
Overview 
The assurance of a sustainable supply of natural gas and the development of domestic infrastructure 
network are two major components for a successful expansion of downstream natural gas industry 
in the country. It is capital-intensive that will need both public and private sector’s investment and 
participation. For 15 years, since the launching of the 1st Malampaya natural gas-to-power project in 
2001, the government is earnestly providing full support to any project that can partake in the 
country’s natural gas industry. Both foreign and local developers signified interest to invest in said 
industry. However, a number of concerns had caused the delay in its development. One of which is 
the uncertainty of fuel supply sustainability considering that presently the only source of natural gas 
in the country is the Malampaya gas field. Also, since the industry is said to be capital-intensive, 
investors will need a guarantee of an anchor market that will justify their investments. With these 
challenges, the development of required strategic infrastructure necessary for the industry to 
expand has been delayed. 
Despite the challenges, the government realizes the positive impact that the country could harness 
in expanding the industry. As such, the DOE is seriously undertaking steps towards its acceleration 
and expansion. In 2013, the DOE in partnership with the World Bank has completed the Natural Gas 
Master Plan Update by which one of the objectives is to establish the natural gas investment and 
transactional framework focusing on Liquified Natural Gas (LNG). Likewise, in 2014, the DOE 
commissioned the PNOC to have the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Center to conduct a feasibility 
study on the 105-km. Batangas-Manila Natural Gas Pipeline (BatMan 1) to supplement the JICA’s 
study on the technical aspect for the LNG entire chain (LNG facilities, regasification, pipeline and 
offtake facilities) including social and environmental impact study. And to open the country to LNG 
market, in 2015, the DOE granted an extension of about 12 months to the issued Provisional Permit 
for the nearing completion of the county’s first LNG Terminal Hub and merchant power plant in 
Pagbilao, Quezon owned by Energy World Corporation (EWC). 
On the other hand, in terms of policy support and initiative, the DOE in partnership with Department 
of Trade and Industry – Bureau of Product and Standard (DTI-BPS), in February 2015, the final draft 
of the Natural Gas Quality Standard was published and promulgated. 
Furthermore, in November 2015, the DOE initiated to organize an Inter-Agency HSSE (Health, Safety, 
Security and Environment) Inspection and Monitoring Team (IMT) for natural gas facilities through 
the signing of Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). Members include Department of Health 
(DOH), Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR-EMB), Department of Labor and 
Employment (DOLE-OSHC/BWC), Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG-BFR) and 
Department of Transportation and Communication (DOTC-PCG/MARINA). The objective is to 
conduct an organized and holistic approach of inspection to natural gas facilities that will address 
the areas of health, safety, security and environment. Said program will apply to the existing and 
planned natural gas facilities in the country.  At present, the DOE is also undertaking other development initiatives such as the following: 
 Promoting LNG importation as an option to supplement and replace Malampaya gas, 
ensuring sustainable supply of natural gas to the power and non-power customers. 
 Conducting consultations with the industry stakeholders for its strategic plan for natural gas 
supply expansion for both indigenous/imported. 
 Conducting of industry forum/IEC to the industrial sector, academe, government and 
financial institutions to create awareness on natural gas as well as on the conduct of market 
profiling surveys. 
 Advocating infrastructure development. 
 Institutionalizing the energy mix policy with consideration on the economic and financial 
viability of the applicable technology in the power plant projects cost of electricity in the grid 
and impact to the industrial and household customers. 
 Coordinating with Board of Investments (BOI) for the inclusion of the natural gas projects 
and activities in the Investment Priority Plan (IPP). 
 Pursuing the proposed Natural Gas Bill in terms of the responsiveness of its provisions with 
the current economic and political conditions. 
 Cooperating with inter-agency efforts towards “delivering a lower carbon and more secure 
energy future for the Philippines by developing a government and business roadmap for the 
increase in the use of natural gas” through the establishment of a natural gas / LNG 
coalition. 
Natural Gas Production and Consumption 
As of end-2015, natural gas total 
actual production posted at 
126,192 million standard cubic 
feet (MMSCF) with a shortfall of 
about 3.2 percent as compared 
to the previous year which 
totaled to 130,351 MMSCF. 
Similarly, natural gas 
consumption also decreased by 
6.1 percent from a total of 
125,611 MMSCF in 2014 to 117,926 MMSCF in 2015. Such decreases can be attributed to the 
implementation of planned and unplanned shutdown activities both in the facilities of Malampaya 
and in the customer side such as the gas fired power plants and refinery. And, as of 2nd semester2016, fuel production recorded a total of 73,665 MMSCF while total consumption is at 70,534 
MMSCF. 
Power generation accounts for 97.7 percent of the total annual consumption while industrial sector 
accounts for about 2.3 percent. Transport sector consumption, however, is greatly affected by the 
deferment of the commercial operation of the 31 CNG buses under the DOE’s NGVPPT due to the 
suspended operation of the existing CNG Daughter-refilling station in Mamplasan, Biñan, Laguna.

Source: (1) Consumption data from gas users, (2) Preliminary data as of 
09 August 2016)Currently, the only source of natural gas in the country is the Malamapaya gas field which has an 
average production of 380 MMSCF per day. Apparently, two projects will be implemented to ensure 
a stable supply of natural gas for Luzon Electricity Grid, the Malampaya Phases 2 and 3. In 2013, the 
Malampaya Phase 2 is completed upon the successful installation of two production wells. On the 
other hand, Malampaya Phase 3 involves design, fabrication and installation of a new depletion 
compression platform and is expected to commence operation in 2016. It will also allow additional 
volumes of natural gas to be committed to new customers. 
Market development 
In 2015, main consumers of natural gas in the country are still the three natural gas-fired power 
plants in Luzon which consumed around 115,788.1 MMSCF of gas and the PSPC’s refinery that 
consumed around 2,137.7 MMSCF of gas. Additional market in terms of power generation is 
expected to participate in gas industry by 2016 through the entry of 100-MW Avion Gas Power Plant 
and additional 450-MW San Gabriel Power Plant (Table 23). And, apart from power and industrial 
sector, in 2018, the PNOC-EC CNG supply is expected to be available for the transport sector in view 
of the commercialization phase of the CNG buses under the NGVPPT. 
On the other hand, in terms of gas supply market, the Malampaya or SC 38 new gas and PNOC 
banked gas with a combine volume of 227.99 petajoules has been offered for tender to potential 
natural gas buyers. In 2015, there was a partial awarding of contract to the bidder that meets the 
supplier’s criteria while the remaining volumes of said new gas and banked gas can be made 
available to interest buyers starting 2016. 
Furthermore, to ensure sustainability of natural gas supply, the DOE is considering the importation 
of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) as a major option to meet the demand of the industry. At present, the 
DOE is entertaining proposals from various private parties that will bring LNG into to the country.

The development of natural gas infrastructure is vital for the industry’s expansion program. For now, 
the government is looking into importation of LNG to secure additional supply of natural gas in the 
country. Hence, the required infrastructure must be put in place to ensure the readiness of the 
country for its entry. And since putting-up the LNG infrastructure will entail a huge amount of capital 
investment, it will require a public and private partnership. As such, the financing, construction and 
operation of various natural gas infrastructure projects in the downstream sector will be for the 
private sector while the government will focus on formulation and implementation of strategies and 
programs conducive to the industry’s growth. On the other hand, in instances where a strategic gas 
infrastructure project needs to be initiated, the government may also take an investing role through 
the Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC) to spur project commencement. In the meantime, the 
DOE is monitoring the progress of the following natural gas infrastructure projects proposed by 
various investors (Table 24).

The DOE in cooperation with various industry stakeholders such as suppliers, equipment 
manufacturers and existing natural gas users came up with the final version of the Philippine Natural 
Gas Quality Standard (PNS). In February 2015, said quality standard was forwarded to DTI-BPS 
through the Technical Committee on Petroleum Product and Additives (TCPPA) for promulgation. 
The PNS will ensure that the country is able to source natural gas globally as well as the flexibility to 
use and mix indigenous supply. It also ensures cost competitiveness by reducing the probability of 
having industry and gas facility operators to invest in gas quality adjustment technology. Thus, it will 
be applicable to all natural gas technology for commercial use and sold in the country. 
Roadmap 
The DOE as the lead agency for the development of the country’s natural gas industry needs to 
envisage a roadmap towards its acceleration and expansion. The roadmap is attendant in fulfilling 
the mandate of the DOE and ensuring the industry’s development benefit will be for the welfare of 
the Filipino people. It is our vision for the industry as well as the strategies in the realization of the 
critical mechanisms to leapfrog the development of the industry. Hence, its overall objective by 2030 
is “to establish a world-class, investment driven and efficient natural gas industry that makes natural 
gas as a bridge fuel by all end-use sectors”. 
The five basic components of the roadmap include the gas sector development plan in terms of 
supply, infrastructure, market, capacity/skills building and policy (Figure 28) from short-term to longterm period. 
(1) Expand Supply Source. Currently, the main and only source of natural gas in the country is 
the Malampaya Gas Field which has already been committed to provide requirements for 
the existing gas-fired power plant and refinery. As such, the expansion of supply source of 
the fuel is vital for the development of the industry. The DOE will encourage and promote 
investments in domestic natural gas supply and imported Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) 
throughout the planning period. 
(2) Infrastructure Development. To meet the industry’s demand of target markets, availability 
of required infrastructure for fuel delivery and storage must be developed within the 
planning horizon. This will entail a strong public-private partnership to ensure that identified 
critical infrastructure for this planning period will be pushed through. 
(3) Market Development. The potential of natural gas to fill the future gap in power generation 
must be maximized and so the share of the fuel in power generation mix will be increased. 
Also, the utilization of gas shall be expanded to different demand sectors such as transport, 
industrial, commercial, residential and agriculture. 
(4) Manpower Capacity/Skills Development. Manpower capacity building is essential for 
effective implementation and sustainability of plans and programs under the gas industry. Hence, for this planning period a set of program from short to long-term period will be 
facilitated to develop skills required for the natural gas industry. 
(5) Policy Development. Policy and legislative framework support is necessary in order to 
accelerate the development of the downstream natural gas industry in the country. Under 
this roadmap, formulation of gas related policy as well as legislative framework from short 
to long-term period will be carried out to support the expansion of gas industry in the 
country. 
Furthermore, this roadmap is expected to advance the country’s nascent natural gas industry to a 
matured industry, which is unbundled with various players from retail to wholesale supply 
competition resulting to a reasonable price for natural gas. In the long term, said industry will 
contribute to address climate change mitigation and adaptation measures and at the same time, 
support the inclusive growth of the country’s economy and welfare of the Filipino people.Figure 28. 2016-2030 ROADMAP OF THE DOWNSTREAM NATURAL GAS INDUSTRYAction Plan 
(1) Expand Supply Source 
The DOE will continuously support and promote the exploration and development of natural gas in 
the country. The monitoring and evaluation of development on supply sources of gas will be 
conducted during the planning period. By 2017-2020, the entry of LNG will be carried out to 
augment the existing supply of natural gas in the country. In addition, the DOE shall strengthen the 
country’s position to establish LNG import terminal hub to bring in LNG from nearby countries. In 
anticipation of this, the DOE will monitor and evaluate the development of LNG related projects 
being proposed in the country as well as identify additional LNG import requirement and sourcing. 
(2) Infrastructure Development 
The infrastructure development is one of the key components for the expansion of the downstream 
natural gas industry in the country. Table 24 (Proposed Natural Gas Infrastructure Projects) shows 
the critical gas infrastructure projects identified for this planning period. 
(3) Market Development 
Developing gas market in the country will require enormous effort both from the government and 
the private sector. For this planning period, the DOE will continuously encourage and promote 
private sector to invest and partake in the gas market development from different demand sectors 
such as transport, industrial, commercial, residential and agriculture. 
To jumpstart the natural gas market for power generation, by 2016-2017, two committed natural 
gas power plants will be operational, the 100-MW Avion and 450-MW San Gabriel Power Plants. 
Likewise, the 400-MW LNG power plant will serve as an anchor load for the LNG Hub Terminal 
project of Energy World Corp. In terms of transport market, it is expected that during this planning 
period, CNG vehicles will resume its operation utilizing natural gas from Malampaya gas field. 
Meanwhile, the Downstream Natural Gas Industry Roadmap shows the detailed gas market 
development plan from short to long term period. 
(4) Manpower Capacity/Skills Development 
The following are the identified manpower capacity/skills plan to be carried out in short, medium 
and long term to ensure that goals and objective of the industry will be effectively implemented and

In pursuit of diversified low transport fuel in the country and contribute to mitigating the adverse 
effect of climate change, the government is implementing programs such as Natural Gas Vehicle 
Program for Public Transport (NGVPPT), Auto-LPG and Market Transformation through the 
Introduction of Energy Efficient Electric Vehicles Project. These projects intend to reduce the 
country’s dependence on imported oil as well as provide the people of a cheaper and more 
environment-friendly fuel that will serve as an alternative to fossil fuels. 
COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS 
Natural Gas Vehicle Program for Public Transport (NGVPPT) 
CNG (Buses) 
Overview 
In 2004, Executive Order (E.O.) No. 290 entitled “Implementing the Natural Gas Vehicle Program for 
Public Transport (NGVPPT)” was issued designating the DOE as the lead agency of the program. DOE 
was further tasked in the EO to ensure a unified and coordinated effort to in place a portfolio of 
incentives for the private sector to participate in developing the required logistics and infrastructure 
support. 
The program targets to deploy a total of 200 CNG Public Utility Buses (PUBs) using compressed 
natural gas (CNG) as its pilot phase implementation. In 2008, a total of 61 CNG buses were made 
available by the accredited bus operator for franchising but only 31 units were issued with the 
franchise to operate as public utility bus. During the course of implementing the pilot phase (from 
2009-2015), the program encountered various issues and challenges which include technical issues 
on infrastructure and policy gaps with inter-agency jurisdiction such as; (1) deployment of CNG PUBs 
is highly dependent on the policies being implemented by the Department of Transportation and 
Communication - Land Transportation Franchising Regulatory Board (DOTC - LTFRB), (2) delays in the 
issuance of CNG buses franchise (under the LTFRB jurisdiction), (3) constraint on the CNG fuel 
supply, and (4) the absence of required support infrastructure, such as, refilling stations. 
In spite of the program’s disruptions, in 2014, the country benefited from the program by displacing 
a total of 4 million liters of diesel fuel with a corresponding reduction in CO2 emission of around 
4,400 metric tons. 
More so, the DOE is keen to pursue the program by extending the pilot phase implementation of 200 
CNG buses beyond 2018. To date, the DOE is coordinating with DOTC-LTFRB on the confirmation of 
franchise availability for the targeted 200 CNG buses. On March 2015, the DOTC-LTFRB declared the 
availability of 176 franchises for the CNG buses. Supply Infrastructure 
In 2007, the construction of the CNG mother-daughter refilling stations in Batangas and Laguna 
provide a strong boost to the use of CNG in the transport sector. As planned, said two refilling 
stations served the initial delivered 61 CNG buses out of the targeted 200 that form part of said pilot 
phase implementation of the program. But in May 2014, Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation 
(PSPC) declared that the existing CNG Daughter-station located in Biñan, Laguna, had been 
temporarily closed due to the defective cylinder valves which could lead to fuel leaks in transporting 
CNG from Mother-station to said Daughter-station. Also, the bridge that was used in transporting 
CNG in both stations has been collapsed by typhoon “Santi”. Hence, the PSPC decided to close the 
stations for safety concerns. 
The DOE as the program’s lead agency exerted all the necessary intervention within its mandate to 
sustain the program. Accordingly, the PNOC-EC was mandated by DOE to take over the operation 
and maintenance of the CNG refilling stations. To date, the procurement of two modular CNG 
stations for Biñan, Laguna and Port Area, Batangas City has yet to be finalized considering the issue 
of securing CNG supply and the negative impact of the current low diesel price to the economic 
viability of operating the CNG delivery system. 
Market Development 
The government is extending the NGVPPT’s pilot phase implementation of 200 CNG buses until 
2018. In 2015, the DOE endorsed franchise applications of NGVPPT- accredited bus operators to 
DOTC for processing and approval of franchise contracts. Likewise, the DOE is incessant in 
coordinating with natural gas supplier (Service Contract 38 Consortium) in terms of gas supply of 
CNG up to 2023, beyond the timeline of the pilot phase which will terminate by 2018. 
Moreover, the successful introduction of the CNG utilization for transport is dependent on the 
competitive pricing of CNG up against the diesel price. With the current pump price of diesel 
hovering around PhP 21.00 to PhP 25.00, the NGVPPT will require a form of government incentive 
until the program moves to the commercial phase, where the number of CNG buses will be enough 
to make CNG more competitive with diesel. 
Action Plan 
For this planning period, the DOE will continuously coordinate with the legislative body, academe 
and concerned NGAs for the provision of incentives, capacity building activities, policies and 
guidelines, establishment of CNG tank requalification facility, and development of emergency 
response protocol for CNG vehicles to support the deployment of CNG buses under the program. 
In addition, to sustain the awareness of the program, a continuous IEC campaign and other 
promotional activities will be regularly conducted throughout the planning horizon.LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GAS (LPG) 
Auto-LPG Program
Auto-LPG (Taxis) 
Overview 
In 2007, the soaring gasoline price has pushed the widespread utilization of LPG as a transport fuel 
for commercial taxis in the country. Thus, the DOE issued Department Circular (D.C.) No. 2007-02-
0002 entitled "Providing for the Rules and Regulations Governing the Business of Supplying, Hauling, 
Storage, Handling, Marketing and Distribution of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) For Automotive Use" 
to serve as a guidelines for the increasing demand of LPG as transport fuel. 
In 2010, a total of 17,500 taxi units were converted to Auto-LPG complemented by 217 refilling 
stations that served said units. However, from 2012 up to the present, there is a decline in the total 
number of Auto-LPG taxis plying along the roads which can be attributed to the following factors; (1) 
re-fleeting of new and efficient taxi units; (2) negative public perception on safety and health 
concerns on the use of auto-LPG; (3) expiration of the bulk two (2)-year franchise contract extension 
that was issued by DOST-LTFRB to taxi operators as an incentive and, consequently, conversion of 
newly-acquired taxis to an Auto-LPG fed is not economical for taxi operators, and likewise; (4) the 
decrease in oil prices has also become a setback on Auto-LPG program. 
But despite all of these, the DOE believed in the positive outcome that the program can provide for 
the country. To date, the DOE is spearheading the establishment of an inter-agency Technical 
Working Group to review, update and harmonize AutoLPG guidelines and regulations issued by 
different government agencies. 
Market and Supply Infrastructure Development
Table 25 shows in 2014, the total number of 
commercial Auto-LPG taxis nationwide is at 
9,957 units complemented by 217 refilling 
stations. In 2015, said number of Auto-LPG 
taxis decreased to about 7,266 units 
supported by 202 refilling stations. As 
discussed, the decline was brought about by 
various issues that hampered the program’s 
implementation. But during the 1st half of 2016, Auto-LPG taxis increase to a total of 8,415 units with 
224 refilling stations that serve them. 
On the other hand, to sustain the program, the DOE in coordination with concerned NGAs, promotes 
the mainstreaming of auto-LPG in the transport sector. In June 2016, a Joint Administrative Order 
(JAO) No.1 Series of 2016 entitled “Creating the Technical Working Group (TWG) on the Use of AutoTable 25. AUTO LPG TAXIS AND REFILLING STATIONS

2016 8,415 224
As of 1st half of 2016LPG As Fuel For Public Transport and For Other Related Purposes” was signed and adopted by 
concerned NGAs. The objective of said JAO is to harmonize Auto-LPG related policies, rules and 
guidelines, and establish a mechanism for collaboration, cooperation and coordination among 
member NGAs 27 for the effective implementation of Auto-LPG Program. 
Furthermore, other initiatives for the program include nationwide IEC campaign; formulation and 
adoption of rules, regulations and standards; and the conduct of scientific studies, such as 
performance test and health and hazard assessments. 
Standard Development
To ensure the protection and safety of the public, as of 2015, the DOE in cooperation of Department 
of Trade and Industry-Bureau of Product Standards (DTI-BPS) and other concerned agencies, private 
sector and Technical Committees on Cylinders, Road Vehicles and Refueling Stations have developed

MARKET TRANSFORMATION THROUGH INTRODUCTION OF ENERGY EFFICIENT ELECTRIC 
VEHICLES (EVS) PROJECT OR THE E-TRIKE PROJECT28
Overview 
In partnership with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Clean Technology Fund (CTF), the 
DOE is implementing the Market Transformation through Introduction of Efficient Electric Vehicles 
Project or the E-Trike Project to promote energy efficiency and clean technologies in the transport 
sector. It aims to reduce the sector’s annual petroleum consumption by 2.8 percent (based on 20 
million barrels annual consumption in 2010) and to avoid CO2 emission of estimated 259,008 tons 
annually by shifting to 100,000 electric tricycles (e-trikes). 
In 2012, the Asian Development Bank’s (ADB) donated a total of 623 Electric Vehicles which were 
distributed to a number of local government units (LGUs) for demonstration and promotion 
nationwide. The DOE for its part conducted a nationwide contest for the Best E-Trike Design which 
solicited 180 design entries from the academe, public and private design practitioners. In addition, 
the DOE conducted a total of 61 promotional activities such as IECs, focus group discussions and 
consultations from which participants came from LGUs, financial conduits and Transport Operators 
and Drivers Association (TODA) in order to build up EV market as well as address concern on safety, 
range anxiety, battery and after sales support. 
From 2013 (NEDA Board Approval) to present, the project has undergone fiscal and administrative 
constraints as well as limitations which resulted to difficulty in securing commitments from the local 
government units. The tedious process under an International Competitive Bidding and the conduct 
of local and national elections affected project implementation. 
In spite of the program’s hurdles, in February 2016, the program’s procurement of 3,000 E-trikes has 
been issued a Notice to Proceed to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder, and target deployment 
by 3rd quarter of 2016. Furthermore, in 2016, the DOE plans to procure 6,000 additional units. On 
the other hand, based on the DTI-Board of investments data, from 2013 onward, ten (10) companies 
 
28 The Market Transformation Thru the Introduction of Energy Efficient Electric Vehicles Project upon the DOE’s request for cancellation, 
has been partially cancelled and approved ad referendum by the Investment Coordination Committee-Cabinet Committee (ICC-CC) 
through the request by the ICC-CC technical Board Chair on December 6,2016. Furthermore, the DOE was requested to advise the ICC-CC 
Chair and members of its decision on the best option for the distribution of the procured 3,000 E-Trike units.put up domestic production/ assembly of electric vehicles with total project cost of Php 506 million 
and hired 672 employees. 
More so, realizing the positive impact that can be harnessed in utilizing EVs, the adoption on the use 
of electric vehicles (e-trikes, e-scooters, e-bikes, e-jeeps and e-quad) continues to gain momentum 
with about 8,000 electric vehicles (data from Electric Vehicle Association of the Philippines) in 
accumulated sales. 
Action Plan 
For EV industry to take off, the DOE has come up for a short to medium-term action plan that will 
assist in its establishment.

ELECTRIC AND HYBRID VEHICLES 
Non-Project Grant Aid (NPGA) for the Introduction of Japanese Advanced Products and Its System 
(Next Generation Vehicle Package) 
In 2013, the Government of Japan (GOJ) coordinated with the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) 
and DOE for the Japan Non-Project Grant Aid for the Introduction of Japanese Advance Products and 
its System (Next Generation Vehicle Package) for the Philippines. The grant-aid is generally designed to support the economic and social development of developing 
countries through the provision of Japanese next-generation vehicles. For the country, the aim of 
the grant-aid is to support the procurement and importation of vehicles to complement the 
government’s rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts in areas affected by typhoon “Yolanda”. At 
the same time, it will also provide support to the Japanese manufacturers through the introduction 
of their advance technology vehicles while contributes to our government’s efforts of promoting 
efficient and environment-friendly Alternative Fuel Vehicles (AFVs). The grant aid has been approved 
by the Office of the President through a letter dated 21 December 2015. 
Under the terms of the grant aid, next generation vehicles such as Hybrid vehicles (HVs), Plug-in 
Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) and Electric Vehicles (EVs), including charging stations will be 
procured in Japan through the Japan International Cooperation System (JICS). The grant covers the 
procurement and delivery of vehicles to agreed destinations. However, all taxes shall be shouldered 
by our government as its counterpart as well as the corresponding MOOE for the distribution and 
deployment of the vehicles. 
Target beneficiaries of said grant-aid include PNP Police Stations in the provinces of Leyte and Samar 
which are devastated by typhoon “Yolanda”, NGAs Regional Offices in Region 8 that are 
instrumental to emergency response operations and rehabilitation, and, NGAs that could assist in 
the conduct of research, performance testing and promotion of AFVs were also allotted with 
vehicles for promotional purposes. 
Currently, the NPGA, through the JICS, is in the final preparation of the tender documents, which is 
supposed to be completed by May 17, 2016. The expected award of the contract is on June 30, 2016. 
Meanwhile, the schedule for the delivery of the first batch of AFVs will be by end-2016 while the 
second batch will be by 2nd semester of 2017. Furthermore, the DOE continuously coordinates with 
the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA), Bureau of Customs (BOC) and Department of Finance (DOF) to 
facilitate the implementation of the NPGA. 
OTHER ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES 
The DOE continuously monitor emerging and matured energy technologies in other countries which 
can be adopted for domestic application. As such, a thorough evaluation, testing and validation will 
be done for domestic application specifically in the transport sector. In the medium term, the DOE 
will embark on the following identified energy technologies for evaluation and validation: 
1. Cellulosic biomass feedstock for bioethanol production and woodchips production 
Efficient domestic cook stove using wood chips; 
2. Fuel derived from petroleum based waste materials such as plastics and rubbers; and 
3. Efficient biomass based stove for domestic cooking, fuel derived from petroleum based 
waste materials; and 
4. Micro-energy harvesting technologies. 
Once the technologies assessed and approved to be locally applicable, the program for performance 
testing and demonstration for said technologies will be developed for possible commercialization.ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CONSERVATION 
Overview 
The government’s program on promoting energy efficiency and conservation (EE&C) is one of the 
longest –running initiatives of the country starting in the early 70’s. This was significantly supported 
by the launching of the National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Program (NEECP) in August 
2004. The NEECP aimed to further strengthen the implementation of EE&C programs through the 
judicious and efficient utilization of energy in the country. The primary goal of the program is to 
make EE&C a way of life, increase awareness and the attainment of measurable targets for the 
period 2011 to 2030 which focuses on reducing the country’s final energy demand by 10 percent, 
obtain an energy savings of 69,100 KTOE and deferment of 6,780 MW of additional capacity and 
emission reduction of 178,980 kT of carbon dioxide emission. Major initiatives under this umbrella 
program include the following: a) Conduct of IECs, b) Energy Efficiency Standards and Labeling 
Program, c) Government Energy Management Program, d) Energy Management Program, and e) 
Philippine Energy Efficiency Project (PEEP). However, measurable targets under said Program needs 
re-calibration due to differing interpretation issues (e.g. setting an annual energy demand reduction 
target of 10% creates confusion as to whether demand should be reduced 10% from the baseline 
each year, or to reach this level cumulatively by end of the period, setting out expected energy 
savings and greenhouse gas reduction does not recognize exogenous changes in demand, 
comparison with regional and other targets requires consistency in methodology, and sectoral 
targets, as well as overall goals need to be articulated). 
Although substantial accomplishments were achieved through the NEECP, the DOE still saw the need 
for stronger overarching objectives to guide its energy efficiency program development. It has been 
observed that various strategies and directions on EE&C are found to be lacking in sustainability, 
have not been specific enough or substantially targeted to guide a long term development program. 
In addition to the creation of the NEECP, other EE&C initiatives could be traced to the 2008 
Philippine Energy Summit discussion on EE&C which resulted to the development of the major 
priority action plans for implementation by government and the public sectors. Subsequently, these 
plans were re-expressed under the Energy Reform Agenda of the Aquino Administration. Likewise, 
various presentations and public statements of the Department in 2012 and 2013 have shown a 
slightly revised expression on the current EE&C priorities and strategies. 
Roadmap 
Purpose of the Roadmap 
The main objective in the formulation of the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Roadmap is to 
create a more energy-efficient Philippines across all economic sectors, as well as help make energy 
efficiency and conservation a “Way of Life” for the Filipinos. Subsequently, this initiative will help 
advance economic development and ensure energy security, optimal energy pricing and sustainable 
energy systems. It is also envisioned that the development of the Roadmap will articulate the action 
plans in all sectors considering relevant timeframe for implementation. In consultation with the DOE and relevant stakeholders of the sector, the DOE in cooperation with 
the EU Switch Asia Policy Support Component started the development of the Energy Efficiency and 
Conservation Roadmap, starting with the review of the energy demand profile of the Philippines and 
its ongoing EE&C programs and activities. The review looked into the effectiveness of the EE&C 
programs, identification of implementation gaps, challenges and un-realized opportunities, as well 
as potential energy savings by sector. 
I. Goals and Sectoral Targets 
The Roadmap was designed specifying sectoral targets broken down into short term 
(2014 to 2015), medium-term (2016 to 2020) and long-term (2021 to 2030). 
Summarized below are the some of the major initiatives identified for each economic 
sector defined for the planning period 2014 to 2030: 
a) Transport Sector 
As the top energy-intensive sector of the economy, the Roadmap of the transport 
sector targets the development of fuel efficiency standards for all vehicles or the 
establishment of a Minimum Energy Performance Standard (MEPS) for brand new 
passenger cars and light-duty vehicles, promotion of the use of electric vehicle for 
the Philippine market, awareness- raising to educate public and private vehicle 
drivers, reintegration of urban planning and transport energy use to develop a more 
acceptable energy efficient transport system policy. In the long –term plan, the DOE 
shall extend all these programs to include passenger and cargo vessels including the 
aviation industry.
b) Industrial Sector 
The promotion of ESCO in the industrial sector is one of the key activities of the DOE.
The rest of the program for medium to long-term plan includes the development of 
Minimum Energy Performance Standard for industrial Motors; the consideration to 
include Demand Response (changes in the consumption of electricity by end-use 
customers from their normal consumption patterns in response to changes in the 
price of electricity over time as option to conserve energy); and review of 
investment rules for energy efficiency to remove distortion. 
c) Commercial Building 
Promotion of energy efficiency in buildings is one of the key challenges facing the 
DOE. 
The strategies for adoption include the following: 
The Department will continue promoting the participation of Energy Service 
Companies (ESCOs) not only in the private sector but also in the public building sector. Thus, DOE shall work on demonstration retrofits to showcase ESCOs and 
financing models. 
Likewise, a focus group will be reformulated to oversee energy efficiency measures 
in accordance with the Building Code. Currently, Administrative Order 110 (s.2004) 
requires government agencies to designate its Energy Conservation Officers who will 
manage and implement plans and programs on energy efficiency and conservation. 
For the private sector, under an ASEAN energy cooperation (“ASEAN Energy 
Management Scheme” or AEMAS), the Energy Practitioner Association of the 
Philippines (ENPAP) was given accreditation by the ASEAN Center for Energy (ACE) to 
trained and certify “Energy Manager”. However, this initiative remains to be on a 
voluntary basis only. But should the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Bill be 
enacted into law, it will now become a requirement that all energy intensive 
companies employ a Certified Energy Manager to manage their energy utilization.
Another major activity is the promotion of the green building ratings. Under the 
Philippine Energy Efficiency Project, the DOE in partnership with the Philippine 
Green Building Council (PhilGBC) has developed and enhanced the Green Building 
Rating System with the goal of ensuring the use of energy efficient technologies and 
measures in building design. Under the planning period, the rating system for the 
building sector will be extensively promoted for implementation. 
Finally, the benchmarking and ratings for building information and reporting shall be 
pursued. This will involve the monitoring of energy consumption and collection of 
relevant data. This is expected to be useful in the formulation of new policy 
directions to enhance energy efficiency measures in buildings. Also, energy 
benchmarking would have to commence with the government building sector in line 
with the Government Energy Management Program being implemented by the DOE. 
d) Residential Building 
Currently, government is adopting the standard and labelling program for window 
type airconditioner, refrigerators and freezers, washing machine, Lighting, and 
Television sets. For the planning period, the Roadmap will see this expand to include 
other home appliances in the next few years.
Other programs for the residential building sector include the adoption of Minimum 
Energy Performance Standard (MEPS) in the Residential Building through its 
inclusion in the National Building Code, as well as the development of utilities as key 
implementation partners and information in demand-side management programs. 
Finally, the Roadmap identified the development of appropriate Building Envelope 
measures specifically for roofs and insulation to bring down heat from the 
atmosphere, thereby reducing demand for cooling. e) Cross-Sectoral 
New policies, activities, and programs will be either continued or to be developed in 
the short and medium-term plan such as: 
a) Establishment of enhanced Energy Database System. This would include the 
monitoring and evaluation framework and the data collection regime. 
b) DOE shall increase and enhance awareness raising campaign across all 
demand sectors – i.e., use of tri-media, social media, prints, publications of 
relevant materials, development of TV ad Commercials, radio commercial, 
audio-video presentations, etc.
c) Closer coordination with power facilities (generation, transmission and 
distribution) with the goal of developing a national strategy for efficiency in 
the power supply sector.
d) Closer coordination with the Local Government Units will be put in place. 
This is to capacitate LGUs on the various facets of Energy Efficiency and 
Conservation from Technology to actual application of measures. The 
development of local ordinances pertaining to the promotion of energy 
efficiency and conservation shall be one of the major output of this 
campaign program. 
e) And finally, there is the vision of establishing an Energy Efficiency and 
Conservation Center for the country. 
Action Plan 
Implementation Strategy 
To effectively accomplish the targets of this Roadmap, a more detailed sectoral action 
plan has been formulated. The 2016-2020 Energy Efficiency Action Plan will provide for 
the programmatic approach to each sectoral targets, as well as identify the available 
resources, institutional arrangements, stakeholder engagement, and timeframes for 
completion.
