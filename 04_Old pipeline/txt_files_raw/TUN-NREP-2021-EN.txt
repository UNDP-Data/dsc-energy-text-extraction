OF TUNISIAForeword
For over three decades, Tunisia has been committed to a clean energy transition through a proactive and 
uninterrupted energy management policy, positioning itself as a pioneer in the region. Tunisia embarked on an 
accelerated energy transition to achieve multiple objectives; to realise its energy security through a diversified 
energy mix and to improve the country’s economic competitiveness within the framework of its strategic vision 
towards a low-carbon economy.
Tunisia’s energy transition strategy is based on four main pillars: energy security; increasing energy independence; 
reducing costs; and diversifying energy resources. With abundant renewables sources, renewable energy 
technologies constitute the main pillar of Tunisia’s energy transition strategy given the socio-economic benefits 
that this strategy will provide to the Tunisian economy in terms of increased investments, a clean economic 
growth, job creation and preserving the environment. Similarly, improving energy efficiency would contribute to 
this energy transition by reducing the demand for energy.
In this regard, a Tunisian solar plan was adopted in 2015, which aims to reduce primary energy demand by 30% 
and increase the share of renewables in the electricity production mix to 30% by 2030.
I would like to thank the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) for its support throughout the process to 
deliver the Renewables Readiness Assessment report that provides a detailed analysis on the status of renewable 
energy in the country and identifies short- to medium-term actions needed to develop enabling frameworks 
conducive to increased renewable energy investments.
This analysis was conducted through close collaboration between the National Agency for Energy Conservation 
(ANME), the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mines and IRENA. It provides relevant and focused information to all 
the stakeholders in the field of renewable energy, including governmental institutions, public and private-sector 
companies, and regional and international development organisations.
On behalf of the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mines let me reiterate my thanks to, all the IRENA team members 
and national stakeholders who contributed to the completion of this report. I hope that this co-operation will be 
accelerated in the future, allowing the achievement of the Energy Transition goals in Tunisia.

Foreword
Tunisia’s need to ensure a continuous energy supply, enhance energy security and long-term industrial and socioeconomic development provides a compelling case for renewables. As governments advance on recovery plans 
amid significant public financing constraints, an energy transition with renewables is a central pillar of decarbonising 
the energy mix. With increasing cost-competitiveness and abundantly available resources, renewable energy 
solutions will be instrumental in achieving the objectives of improving energy security, reducing cost of energy 
supply for consumers and advancing environmental preservation. 
Tunisia’s energy transition is notably based on the implementation of an energy management strategy that is built 
on the increase of energy efficiency and the development of renewable energy, with a 30/30 target to reduce 
primary energy demand by 30% in 2030 compared to the trend scenario; and renewable energy to 30% of the 
electricity production by 2030, in comparison to the installed 373 MW renewable energy in 2019.
Renewables Readiness Assessment: Tunisia, prepared in collaboration with the National Agency for Energy 
Conservation (ANME) and the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mines, identifies key challenges as the country 
pursues environmentally and economically sustainable power and heat. It offers recommendations under five 
thematic areas that address renewables applications in the power sector and long-term energy planning, and 
attract renewable energy financing. The recommended actions present the collective outcome of which is for 
renewables to reach a much higher share in Tunisia’s energy mix while improving energy security and cost of 
supply. 
Tunisia has made important strides over the past decade to encourage the involvement of the private sector 
and accelerate the realisation of national objectives, the assessment finds the need to improve the mapping 
of renewable energy resources, establish an energy planning framework with higher shares of renewables that 
building capacity of local financing institutions and developers will unlock further investment in the sector, and 
reinforce Tunisia’s renewable energy targets. 
IRENA wishes to thank the team at ANME for their key input and engagement. We also appreciate the valuable 
contributions of numerous other stakeholder and international partners. I sincerely hope the resulting study helps 
to accelerate Tunisia’s shift to a sustainable energy future.

Tunisia has witnessed growing deficits in its energy balance 
over the past two decades. This trend is largely the result 
of increasing energy consumption in all economic sectors, 
coupled with the decline of hydrocarbon production. 
This led to an energy deficit amounting to 50% in 2019 
compared to 7% in 2010, thus leading the country to 
become more dependent on imported fossil energy. 
The electricity generation mix is dominated by natural 
gas, while renewable energy resources represented only 
3.0% in 2019. This strong dependence on natural gas 
has serious implications for Tunisia’s energy security, 
since domestic production of gas has stagnated to the 
point of even declining in recent years.
In response to the energy security challenges of the 
early 2000s, and Tunisia’s vulnerability to volatile 
international energy prices, the country has decided to 
embark on an energy transition process as part of its 
wider sustainable economic and social development 
strategy. Amid the coronavirus outbreak in early 2020, 
renewables and energy efficiency have become a key 
part of the country’s recovery plans.
Tunisia’s energy transition is notably based on: 
• Diversification of the energy mix and integration of 
renewable energies
• Strengthening energy efficiency
• Rationalisation of the energy subsidy
• Strengthening of the grid and the interconnections
The implementation of an energy management 
strategy that is built on the increase of two components:
(i) energy efficiency and the development of 
renewable energy, with a 30/30 target to reduce 
primary energy demand by 30% in 2030 compared to 
the trend scenario; and (ii) renewable energy to 30% 
of the electricity production by 2030.
The Tunisian Solar Plan (TSP) is the intended operational 
tool to implement the strategy to increase the share of 
renewable electricity. The latest TSP version was updated 
by Tunisia’s National Agency for Energy Management 
(ANME – Agence Nationale pour la Maîtrise de l’Energie) 
in 2015 and adopted by the government in July 2016. 
To achieve the country’s update objectives, 
the TSP has established a target for total 
installed renewable energy capacity at
1 860 megawatts (MW) by 2023 and 3 815 MW by 
2030, a five-fold and ten-fold increase, respectively, 
from the 2017 installed renewable energy capacity. 
The targets were updated to reflect Tunisia’s climate 
commitment to reduce the country’s carbon intensity 
by 41% compared to 2010 by 2030 compared to an 
unconditional target to reduce carbon intensity by 13%, 
specifically as pledged in its Nationally Determined 
Contributions under the Paris Agreement. The bulk 
of the country’s identified mitigation potential arises 
from the energy sector, including 68% from energy 
efficiency and 32% from renewable energy. 
The considerable amount of installed renewable 
energy capacity needed to meet the targets set out 
in the TSP will require extensive private investment 
support. In response, the Tunisian state adopted 
regulatory reforms in 2015 through a new law (Law 
No. 2015-12) relating to the production of electricity 
from renewable energy. The objective is to establish 
a legal framework that is conducive to privatesector investment in the production of electricity 
that will arise from renewable energy sources 
through three new regulatory regimes: (i) selfgeneration/consumption; (ii) independent power 
production for local consumption (concession and
authorisation); and (iii) independent power production 
for export.
Notwithstanding the new legal framework and 
the various measures adopted by the Tunisian 
government over the past two years, several of these 
measures include enabling policy initiatives, update 
of the current documentation surrounding current 
electricity purchase agreements, and establishment 
of guarantees to encourage the development of 
renewable energy. There remain several challenges 
that hinder the transition, however; these have been 
identified under Tunisia’s national energy strategy.
Various barriers to renewable energy development 
were identified through the Renewables Readiness 
Assessment (RRA) process. These could be addressed 
through eight key recommended actions.EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The RRA’s main recommendations can be summarised
as follows:
Establish a renewable energy planning 
and scheduling framework
• With the TSP calling for additions of about
4 gigawatts (GW) of variable renewable energy 
(VRE) sources (i.e. solar and wind power) to the 
grid, the country will require a holistic long-term 
planning methodology that will include realistic 
scheduling for capacity additions to the national 
electricity system beyond 2023. Advance plans on 
new capacity, locations and technologies can help 
to address system constraints. VRE deployment 
must be supported by robust long-term energy 
and power sector planning. 
• The plan could also address electricity grid 
infrastructure development to enable the smooth 
integration of VRE into the system. The plan 
should provide long-term visibility on renewable 
energy development prospects in Tunisia. In this 
context, the opportunities for regional dialogue 
and collaboration are significant and may lead to 
broader flexibility solutions (IRENA, 2020a).
Enhance renewables resource 
assessment through zoning 
• Long-term energy planning relies on data from 
resource databases. Tunisia’s current resource 
database, therefore, should be improved to reflect 
the recent assessment campaigns on renewable 
energy resources. More detailed resource data 
will be essential to define promising development 
zones across Tunisia’s territory for different 
renewable energy technologies. The Global 
Atlas for Renewable Energy, an online resource 
assessment platform hosted by the International 
Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), provides 
guidance on identifying cost-effective zones with 
high renewable energy potential. 
Simplify procurement procedures for
power grid development
• The acquisition and implementation of grid 
transmission infrastructure by the Tunisian 
Company of Electricity and Gas (STEG) is subject 
to long-running public procurement procedures, 
resulting in a time lag between renewable energy 
plant completion dates and connection to the grid 
to send out the electricity produced.
• IRENA has established that integrated studies with 
key renewable energy stakeholders could help 
identify grid infrastructure scenarios. Such studies 
would reflect planned additions of both solar 
and wind capacity totalling 1 000 MW under the 
Concessions scheme. This would ensure alignment 
between renewable generation development and 
grid infrastructure reinforcement. 
Clarify institutional roles and
strengthen human resources
• Private-sector developers have faced difficulties 
understanding the procedures to obtain authorisation 
for projects, given the considerable number of 
ministries and public institutions involved in renewable 
energy projects. In response, the Government of 
Tunisia has taken preliminary measures, supported by 
international partners in the field, such as the United 
Nations Development Programme. Measures include a 
Help Desk provided by the ANME that would provide 
guidance to the private sector.
• IRENA has found that combining efforts and 
creating a single online platform may ensure 
transparency and clarity of the roles of the 
various involved institutions in terms of project 
agreements. The platform would include guidelines 
under a standard template and would list the 
public institutions involved, including the roles and 
responsibilities of each during the various stages 
of project implementation (Section 4.3).
COVID-19 pandemic recovery
Amid the coronavirus outbreak in early 2020, renewables
and energy efficiency have become a key part of
the country’s recovery plans.• Renewable energy transition will bring with it 
ample benefits, including the opportunity to build 
human resources and skills. In this context, public 
institutions may opt to strengthen their current 
human capacity through enhanced training 
sessions on the technical, economic, administrative 
and legal aspects relating to the development of 
renewable energy projects.
Establish an independent 
electric power regulator
• The procedures to create and establish an 
independent regulatory authority for the electricity 
sector are being finalised as part of Tunisia’s NDCs 
to ensure the achievement of its renewable energy 
targets. The authority will ensure compliance with 
regulations and will promote a transparent and fair 
competitive environment for private producers.1
• The regulatory authority will, among other 
responsibilities, oversee a range of project 
development procedures for renewable energy, 
including the monitoring of legislation to ensure 
effectiveness and the validation of technical 
conditions for electricity evacuation. It also will 
ensure the streamlining of not only the governing 
administration but also of the various market 
actors.
Operationalise the Energy Transition Fund
• The Energy Transition Fund (FTE – Fonds de 
transition énergétique) is the principal financing 
tool for energy efficiency and renewable energy 
activities in Tunisia. For the fund to effectively 
support renewables in the country, work must 
begin to mobilise the necessary funding from 
the public and private sectors to foster their 
development. To do this effectively will require a 
combination of incentives, loans and credit lines 
from international finance institutions.
Create a dedicated financing mechanism
for solar water pumping
• Design a programme encouraging farmers to 
substitute solar photovoltaic (PV) energy for 
diesel, given the important socio-economic 
impacts of solar water pumping. This programme 
may be developed under the broader Prosol and 
Prosol électrique programme mechanisms, such 
that the state subsidy, including the credit system, 
is compatible with the repayment capacity of 
farmers.
Involve local banks in the financing 
of renewable energy
• The development of renewable energy applications 
in Tunisia, particularly for farmers and small- and 
medium-size enterprises, requires involvement by 
local banks. To improve the capacity for project risk 
assessment at local financial institutions and boost 
their confidence to develop lending schemes, the 
government should reinforce their human and 
technical capacity.
• The search for favourable foreign financial lines 
should be strengthened, particularly through 
bilateral co-operation and climate financing 
programmes guaranteed by the Tunisian Guarantee 
Company (Société tunisienne de garantie)2
 or 
reinforced by the Central Bank of Tunisia. This 
should reduce concerns that surround private 
sector investment risk over the need to commit 
30% equity for PV installations and thus improve 
financial viability. 
• The Energy Transition Fund, Tunisia Investment 
Authority and Tunisian Guarantee Company can 
be complemented with guarantee funds or secure 
credit lines (e.g. liquidity guarantees or credit lines) 
to local commercial banks by international finance 
institutions like the French Development Agency 
(AFD) and International Finance Corporation.

Introduction
1.1 Country background
Tunisia is located in the northernmost part of Africa. Tunisia’s capital, Tunis, is in the 
northeast of the country. The total surface area coverage of Tunisia is 163 610 square 
kilometres (km2), with arable land constituting 19% of total land area (Trading 
Economics, 2020) and the Sahara representing more than 30% (RES4MED, 2016). 
The population of Tunisia in 2017 reached 11.54 million, with an annual growth rate 
of 1.1%. Total urban population is 69% (INS, 2018a).
Tunisia benefits from unique climatic features, placing the country as an emerging 
economic hub and attractive tourist destination. The climate varies considerably 
from one region to another - Mediterranean in the north and along the coast, semiarid within the country and arid in the south. The landscape similarly contrasts, with 
mountainous regions in the northwest, steppes in the centre, vast plains in the north, 
the Sahel to the east and desert in the south. 
Tunisia had an average annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 4.3% 
over the period 2000–2010, and was considered the most competitive economy in 
Africa. Despite political instability, Tunisia has witnessed a rapid recovery of its GDP 
growth following a recession in 2011, reaching 4.0% in 2012. Since then, however, it 
has struggled to maintain this level, with a 2.6% growth rate in 2018. The evolution 
of GDP growth since 2000 is shown in Figure 1.

Annual growth (%)Several factors challenge the national economic 
situation today, including the devaluation of the 
Tunisian dinar, thus amplifying the public debt and 
foreign trade deficit to record highs. As of September 
2018, Tunisia has a public debt of 71.4% relative to 
GDP, with a foreign trade deficit that widened by 
16.8% over 2017 (Trading Economics, 2020). Table 1 
presents further details on the economic indicators 
recorded in Tunisia during the last few years.
Tunisia has undertaken a series of reforms, including a 
Strategic Development Plan (SDP) that was adopted 
for the period 2016–2020 to boost economic activity 
and investment, as well as to reassure stakeholder 
confidence. The SDP represents a new development 
model that is based on the promise of a new social 
contract under which the state is expected to provide 
a level playing field to ensure inclusion and equal 
opportunity.
The main objective of the SDP is the transformation 
and modernisation of Tunisia’s existing economic 
model, aiming to reduce unemployment to 11.5% and 
reach an average GDP growth rate of 5% in 2020.

Development Plan, 2016-2020
• Good governance includes fighting corruption 
and easing the administrative barriers to 
economic participation, in order to increase 
opportunities for success for all citizens.
• Shifting to a hub economy focuses on 
increasing productivity for competitiveness 
and positioning Tunisian businesses in global 
value chains. 
• Promoting human development and social 
inclusion emphasises quality education, 
women’s participation in economic and

1.2 Renewables Readiness Assessment 
for Tunisia
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) 
developed the Renewables Readiness Assessment 
(RRA) as a tool for carrying out a comprehensive 
evaluation of the conditions for renewable energy 
deployment in a country. The RRA is a country-led 
and consultative process. It provides a framework 
for multi-stakeholder dialogue to identify challenges 
to renewable energy deployment and to arrive at 
recommendations to overcome existing barriers. 
Short-and medium-term recommended actions are 
presented to governments to guide the formation 
of new policies or the reform of existing ones, thus 
opening a more enabling environment for renewable 
energy. The RRA also consolidates existing efforts and 
mobilises resources for priority actions. 
The RRA elaboration process was launched at the 
request of the previously known Ministry of Energy, 
Mines and Renewable Energy (Ministère de l’Energie 
des Mines et des Energies Renouvelables), now known 
as Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mines. However, 
from March 2020 to October 2020, renewable energies 
were taken up by the Ministry of Energy, Mines and the 
Energy Transition (Ministère de l’Energie des Mines et 
de la Transition Enérgitique). From September 2018 
to March 2020, renewable energies were taken up by 
Ministry of Industry and Small and Medium Enterprises 
(MISME – Ministère de l’Industrie et des Petites et 
Moyennes Entreprises,).3
IRENA developed this RRA assessment for Tunisia 
in conjunction with the National Agency for Energy 
Management (ANME – Agence Nationale pour la Maîtrise 
de l’Energie), the public agency responsible for executing 
the government’s policies in energy management 
studying and promoting renewable energy. 
Applying the RRA framework to Tunisia provides a 
comprehensive analysis of the presence or absence of 
enabling conditions for the development of renewables. 
Crucially, the analysis considers how the country’s 
renewable energy policies can contribute to its national 
policy objectives. This coincides with the government’s 
efforts to assess the context for renewables in Tunisia, 
particularly since the introduction of the country’s 
renewable energy action plan, the Tunisian Solar Plan 
(TSP), was put in place in 2015. The RRA highlights the 
key issues to be tackled in implementing the TSP, with 
the aim of recognising Tunisia’s positionas a regional 
hub economy as part of the broader framework of 
the SDP. 
A general overview of the Tunisian energy sector 
was outlined during the first stage of process, with 
a special focus on renewable energy. Potential 
barriers and bottlenecks were identified to the ensure 
successful deployment of renewables. IRENA and 
ANME organised an expert validation workshop on 
21 June 2018 to validate these findings and facilitate 
open dialogue among a wide range of stakeholders. 
The main objectives were to discuss the identified 
challenges for renewable energy deployment and the 
corresponding recommendations to ensure favourable 
conditions for the sector. 
The event provided the opportunity to review global 
renewable energy best practices and highlight the 
country’s commitments to renewable energy. It 
enabled local stakeholders to validate the set of 
recommended actions identified through the RRA 
process to further advance the renewable energy 
sector, for endorsement by MEMTE. This report lays 
out the necessary actions and conclusions drawn from 
the RRA process in Tunisia.

The energy sector is a key contributor to Tunisia’s various economic sectors. In the 
past two decades, however, the country has witnessed a growing energy balance 
deficit, largely as a result of relying on fossil fuel sources – oil and natural gas – to 
meet its heightened energy demand. The decline of its own hydrocarbon resources 
has led to increased dependence on fossil fuel imports, which rose to record levels 
in 2019 when the deficit in the balance of primary energy reached 5 672 thousand 
tonnes of oil equivalent (ktoe), as shown in Figure 2, highlighting that 49% of total 
energy consumed is imported.
In response, Tunisia has begun to leverage its wide array of renewable energy sources 
to diversify its energy mix. This is coupled with energy efficiency programmes to 
alleviate its energy balance deficit.

2.1 Energy supply and demand in Tunisia
The country is close to being fully electrified at 99.8%. The 
electricity generation mix is dominated by natural gas at 
97.5%. The strong dependence on natural gas has serious 
implications for Tunisia’s energy security, as domestic 
production of natural gas has stagnated and even declined 
during recent years. Between 1990 and 2019, primary 
energy production fell from 5400 ktoe to 3703 ktoe. 
Domestic production of oil and natural gas has dropped 
significantly since 2010 (54% and 47%, respectively), as 
shown in Figure 3.
In 2018, natural gas accounted for 48.7% of total primary 
energy supply (TPES), equivalent to 5569 ktoe, and oil 
(including primary and secondary oil) accounted for 40.8 % 
of TPES, totalling 4 665 ktoe (Figure 4) (MISME, 2018b). The 
remainder largely came from biomass and waste sources.

Primary energy demand reached 9 606 ktoe in 2019 
against 8 358 ktoe in 2010, with an average annual 
growth rate of 1.7%. After a dip in 2016, the energy 
demand/supply balance deficit accelerated again 
in 2017, strengthening a major structural deficit that 
compels the country to further rely on energy imports, 
increasing from an import dependency rate of 7% in 
2010 to 60% in 2018, as shown in Figure 5.
The country’s energy deficit problem is likely to 
deteriorate further given rising energy demand, 
coupled with depleting oil and gas production. 
The current increase in energy imports highlights 
Tunisia’s economic and social vulnerability amid 
volatile international energy prices, further 
amplified with the devaluation of the Tunisian dinar 
(TND). Figure 6 shows the evolution of the energy 
import bill, which peaked in 2014 at more than 
TND 7 billion (over USD 3.5 billion at the time or
USD 2.5 billion at mid-2019 exchange rates).ENERGY CONTEXT
According to the National Energy Observatory 
(Observatoire National de l’Energie),4 total final 
energy consumption (TFEC) reached approximately
8 710 ktoe in 2019; excluding biomass,5 it amounted to 
7 620 ktoe. Oil products accounted for 53% of TFEC, 
followed by natural gas and electricity in equal shares, 
as shown in Figure 7. 
4 The National Energy Observatory is the public institution mandated by MEMTE to ensure the effective collection of data relevant to energy. Since April 2017, it has been renamed the 
National Observatory of Energy and Mines (Observatoire National de l’energie et des Mines).
5 Biomass in the Tunisian context mainly relates to modern means of biomass, as defined by the International Energy Agency’s statistics database, used in relation to Tunisia’s residential 
sector (Figure 9)
Energy is used in various end-use sectors in the 
economy, including transport (32%), industry (27%) 
and the residential sector (27%). This is followed by 
the commercial and agricultural sectors (8% and 6%, 
respectively), as shown in Figure 8.

Source: IEA (2019), MISME (2019b).The source of TFEC differs from one economic 
activity to another. Figure 9 shows that natural gas 
is consumed mainly by the industrial sector, while the 
energy consumption of the agricultural, residential 
and transport sectors is dominated by petroleum 
products, particularly liquefied petroleum gas in 
households that are not connected to the natural gas 
distribution network.
2.2 Electricity governance
As of March 2020, the Tunisian electricity sector is 
managed by the Ministry of Energy, Mines and the 
Energy Transition. For the past two years, renewable 
energy portfolio was managed by the Ministry of 
Industry, Small and Medium Size Enterprises. MEMTE 
is responsible for electricity infrastructure, planning 
and the implementation of national policy in the field 
of electricity, energy efficiency and renewable energy, 
with regulatory oversight also carried out by the 
ministry. Yet, Tunisia has no independent regulator. 
Instead, MEMTE monitors and analyses the evolution 
of supply and demand, with two directorates 
responsible for carrying out specific activities in the 
energy sector:

in the renewable energy sector and examining 
requests for private production and selfconsumption of electricity from renewable energy. 
• Directorate General for Energy from Hydrocarbon 
sources: Re-sponsible for implementing state 
policy in the hydrocarbon sector. 
• Directorate General for overseeing Strategy 
and Co-ordination: Responsible for developing 
programmes and strategies, as well as national 
and sectoral policies, pertaining to the energy 
sector, coupled with action plans to ensure better 
management of resources. 
• Directorate General for Manufacturing Industries: 
Responsible for implementing government policy 
relevant to industry, including development of an 
enabling environment for the promotion of the 
renewables industry. ENERGY CONTEXT
The monopoly on electricity generation, transmission 
and distribution from 1962 to 1996 was held by the 
Tunisian Company of Electricity and Gas (STEG – 
Société Tunisienne d’Electricité et du Gaz). STEG is 
a state-owned company responsible for managing 
the production, transmission and distribution of 
electricity and gas in Tunisia in high-, mediumand low-voltage lines and pipelines, including the 
implementation and operation of renewable energy 
projects. 
ANME, a public institution under the Ministry of 
Energy, Mines and the Energy Transition, became 
responsible as of 1985 for executing the government’s 
policies for promoting energy efficiency measures 
and the deployment of renewable energy. Moreover, 
ANME is responsible for proposing regulations and 
manages the Energy Transition Fund (FTE – Fonds 
de transition énergétique). ANME’s additional 
responsibilities include managing the specific 
renewable energy programmes (i.e. Prosol and Prosol 
électrique) and developing awareness and training 
campaigns for the deployment of renewable energy. 
The High Commission for Independent Power 
Production (Commission Supérieure de la
Production Indépendante d’Electricité), a commission 
established under Law No. 96-27, was organised as 
an inter-ministerial body responsible for deciding 
on the procedures and selection criteria for the 
public tender process to (i) select independent 
power producers (IPP); (ii) award contracts to IPPs; 
(iii) pass rulings on granting tax incentives to IPP 
investors, the benefits from which are to be granted 
to the developers of concessions; as well as any other 
matter relating to independent power production. 
The Interdepartmental Commission for 
Independent Power Production (Commission 
Interdépartementale de la Production Indépendante 
d’Electricité), an inter-ministerial body serving as 
a de facto regulator, is responsible for suggesting 
the terms and conditions to be granted to IPP 
concession developers, reviewing the reports and 
examination of tenders submitted for decision to the 
High Commission for Independent Power Production, 
monitoring the negotiations for concession awards 
and securing public subsidies on a case-by-case 
basis. Moreover, the Interdepartmental Commission 
for Independent Power Production is responsible for 
proposing the extension of concession benefits and 
overseeing matters relevant to the implementation 
of projects submitted by the Ministry of Energy, 
Mines and Renewable Energies. 
The Technical Commission for Renewable Energy 
(CTER – Commission Technique des Energies 
Renouvelables) approves power generation projects 
from renewable sources, subject to the system of 
authorisation under the Ministry of Energy, Mines 
and Renewable Energies while approving extensions 
to the validity of authorisations. In addition, CTER 
is the entity responsible for verifying the feasibility 
of developing private renewable projects on lands 
belonging to the state domain. It also examines all 
queries and concerns relevant to the production of 
electricity from renewable energy resources. 
Law No. 96-27 (April 1996) authorises the private 
generation of electricity through concessions provided 
by state authorities. It does not allow, however, unsolicited 
private power production (either from conventional or 
renewable sources). Only one concession agreement has 
been granted, authorising the creation and operation of 
Tunisia’s first IPP (Carthage Power Company in Radès,
471 megawatts (MW)). This power station began 
operation in 2002 under a 20-year power purchase 
agreement (PPA). A private initiative to generate 
electricity from flared gas led to a change in legislation, 
thus paving the way for the second concession 
agreement and Tunisia’s second IPP (Société d’Electricité 
d’El Bibane, SEEB, 27 MW) commissioned in 2003 in El 
Bibane, southern Tunisia, and shut down in 2010 due to 
unforeseen gas supply contamination and the struggle 
to meet scheduled loan repayments. As of February 
2018, the concessions are operationalised by Power 
Turbine Tunisia.
Law No. 2015-12 sets the framework for renewable energy 
proliferation, which includes electricity production from 
renewable energy to generate electricity, transport 
the generated electricity to other consumption points 
through the national grid, and sell the excess produced 
energy to STEG at fixed prices within the limits of the 
maximum rate. With that said the law introduced 
three new regulatory regimes: (i) self-generation/
consumption; (ii) independent power production for 
local consumption (concession and authorisation); and 
(iii) independent power production for export. The fixed 
prices are set by the Minister in charge of energy - in this 
case MEMTE - on opinion of the technical commission, 
with a contract subject to approval by MEMTE. 
Law No. 2015-12, however, was amended by
Law 2019-47, dated 29 May 2019, with adjustments 
to allow for corporate PPAs. This provides the right for 
companies adopting renewables for self-production to 
sell electricity to other consumers or companies with 
subscribed power greater than the threshold set by 
MEMTE electricity 30% and use the national grid network 
to transport electricity2.3 Electricity supply and demand
By the end of 2018, total installed power generation 
capacity had reached 6 147 MW, of which STEG owns 
and operates 74.6% (4 587 MW). The remainder includes 
the natural gas combined-cycle IPP, commissioned in 
2002 and managed by Carthage Power Company, with 
an installed capacity of 471 MW. Natural gas accounts 
for 94.5% of domestic installed power capacity. See 
modifications in Table 2. The evolution of the power 
generation capacity during the period 2016-2018 and 
its composition are detailed in the table.
Electricity production by STEG and Carthage Power 
Company during the period 2013–2018 increased 
from 16 995 gigawatt-hours (GWh)/year to
19 060 GWh/year (STEG, 2019a), recording an average 
annual growth rate of 3%.

In this context, domestic production of natural gas 
stood at approximately 2 139 ktoe, equivalent to 58% 
of the country’s overall electricity production needs. 
With domestic natural gas production declining, 
Tunisia’s energy security could face serious challenges 
in the coming years.
Tunisia’s peak load has experienced robust growth 
during the past decade, as shown in Figure 10. The 
annual peak in electricity demand increased from
2 172 MW in 2005 to 4 025 MW in 2017 (STEG, 2018a), 
climbing at an average pace of 161 MW/year and 
with an average annual growth rate of 5.5%. In 2018, 
however, the peak load dropped due to heightened 
energy efficiency measures. Since 2000, peak load 
demand has transitioned from the winter period 
at night to the summer season in the day due to an 
increase in residential and commercial space cooling.

2467ENERGY CONTEXT
Electricity consumption increased from 10 355 GWh 
in 2005 to 15 671 GWh in 2018, recording an average 
growth rate of 4% per annum. Despite Tunisia’s 
slowdown in economic growth, the industrial sector 
remains the largest consumer of electricity. Its share 
of total electricity consumption, has increased from 
45% in 2005 to 67% in 2018. Since 2013, the largest 
growth in consumption has been recorded by STEG 
customers connected to the low-voltage (LV) grid, 
accounting for 47% of the electricity consumed in 
2017. Figure 11 illustrates the evolution of electricity 
consumption for the different economic sectors 
during the period 2005-2018.
2.4 Transmission and distribution
STEG operated about 6 906 kilometres (km) of 
transmission lines in 2018, with 208 km at the
400 kilovolt (kV) level, 2 910 km at the 225-kV level,
2 382 km at the 150-kV level and 1 406 km at the
90-kV level. The rate of loss on the transmission grid 
reached 2.3% in 2018, as in 2017 (STEG, 2019a).
The transmission grid is currently interconnected 
via one 400 kV line, two 225 kV lines, one 
150 kV line and two 90 kV lines. Tunisia also has 
two 225 kV interconnections. Electricity trade with 
countries in the region represents less than 1% of 
national consumption and the interconnections are 
used mainly for reliability and emergency purposes 
(STEG, 2019a). 
To expand interconnections and the capacity of the 
national grid for renewable energy absorption, an 
infrastructure project known as ELMED has been 
signed to build an underwater interconnection line 
with a capacity of 600 MW between Tunisia and Italy 
(400 kV, direct current, about 200 km). 
Tunisia’s electricity distribution network totalled 
175 389 km by the end of 2018, including 59 691 km 
medium-voltage (MV) lines and 115 698 km LV lines. 
The number of MV/LV transformer substations reached 
75 065 in 2018. Tunisia has an electrification rate 
estimated at 99.8%. The number of STEG customers 
connected to the electricity grid is 4.05 million (high 
voltage (HV): 21 customers; MV: 19 291 customers;
LV: 4 030 130 customers) (STEG, 2019a).
2.5 Electricity tariffs
The selling price of electricity supplied to consumers 
is set by the Tunisian government based on a proposal 
submitted by STEG and after approval of MEMTE and 
the Ministry of Finance. The underlying principle of 
the electricity tariffs is the level of the supply voltage.
LV tariffs depend on the sector of the consumer 
(residential or non-residential), monthly consumption 
(in kilowatt-hours (kWh)) and the level of power 
contracted (in kilovolt amperes). The two LV consumer 
categories are defined in Table 3. Tariff prices for the 
LV network are presented in Table 4 for the respective 
categories.

For MV subscribers, there are two main tariffs: Uniform 
tariff and the Four-shift tariff. 
Under the Four-shift tariff, the price per kWh varies 
according to the time of electricity consumption. 
The distribution of the four shifts (day, morning peak 
summer, evening peak and night) differs between 
seasonsas shown in Table 5
In addition to the two main tariffs, three special tariffs 
exist for irrigation services in water pumping and 
agriculture alike, as well as emergency services. These 
are shown in Table 6. Electricity sold to farmers for 
water pumping is the least expensive. ENERGY CONTEXT

*** During the winter months, from September to May, the tariff is not considered. The tariff applies only during peak summer hours.In addition to the above tariffs, there were natural 
gas tariffs for grey cement industries. These related 
to high pressure and medium pressure lines (Table 7).
For HV users, only the four-shift tariff is available. This 
holds the distinction of being considered a special 
tariff for emergency scenarios, as shown in Table 8.
Due to increased natural gas imports, electricity selling 
prices in Tunisia have been subject to several rises. 
These price adjustments are not periodic and depend 
on the evolution of oil prices and the exchange rate of 
the local currency. 
Prices also depend on government policies, including 
those wherebysubsidies are provided by the state to 
the energy sector. 
The increases during the past decade have been 
significant and have affected all electricity consumers, 
apart from low-consumption households. As an 
indication, Figure 13 presents the evolution of the price 
of electricity sold to those companies connected to 
the MV grid with the Uniform tariff. For this category, 
the total increase stands at about three times those of 
2010 prices.

Enabling environment 
for Renewable Energy 
3.1 Energy transition strategy
In response to energy security challenges and the vulnerability to volatile 
international energy prices, Tunisia has decided to embark on an energy transition 
process as part of its wider sustainable economic and social development strategy. 
A national energy debate was launched in 2013 to define the strategic objectives of 
the new policy through extensive consultations with key energy stakeholders from 
various institutions, public and private organisations, civil society, experts, financial 
organisations and academia, among others. 
The results of this debate concluded that Tunisia must fully engage in an energy 
transition. This should be based on a revision of the modes of production, processing 
and energy consumption to strengthen its energy security, and should safeguard 
the competitiveness of its economy and protect the environment.
Tunisia’s energy transition is based on the implementation of an energy 
management strategy with two components: the increase of energy efficiency and 
the development of renewable energy, such that the main targets are achieved, as 
defined in Figure 14. 
The main objectives of this strategy, developed in 2014 and updated in 2019, are as 
follows:
• Energy efficiency: Strengthen policies and measures for the rational use of 
energy to reduce overall primary energy consumption by 30% in 2030, compared 
to the baseline scenario.
• Renewable energy: Increase the share of renewable energy in the electricity 
production mix to reach 30% in 2030.
Figure 14. Energy strategy targets, Tunisia Energy strategy targets
Energy eciency
Renewable energy
Reduce primary demand 
by 30% by 2030
30% of overall electricity
production by 2030ANME initiated work in 2017 on a low carbon 
strategy to 2050 that would include carbon pricing 
instruments. The Partnership for Market Readiness, 
United Nations Development Programme and World 
Bank are supporting Tunisia in the implementation 
of its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) 
and low carbon strategy. In this context, Tunisia’s 
NDCs pledge to include measures to reduce carbon 
intensity by 41%, including an unconditional target of 
13% and a conditional target of 28%. Moreover, 75% 
of these reductions stem from mitigation measures in 
renewable energy. This commitment is well reflected 
in the TSP and includes measures to build institutional 
capacity and further address the planning gaps from 
the first round to the second round of NDC reviews in 
2020 (UNDP, 2018a). 
The low carbon strategy, to be finalised in 2020, will 
be based on carbon pricing instruments, in line with 
Tunisia’s Energy Conservation Policy (30-30 target), 
FTE and development of its Nationally Appropriate 
Mitigation Actions. It also will depend on international 
support through financial and technical assistance 
(UNDP, 2018b). 
Drivers for the Energy transition strategy:
1. Energy Security: With a growing energy balance 
deficit, there is a compelling case for renewables, 
based on a decline in conventional resources 
against a sustained increase in demand. The ability 
of renewable energy to address energy imports 
is significant. Renewable energy solutions bring 
about important benefits to energy security, 
including availability, accessibility, affordability 
and a long-term outlook.
2. Economics: With the reduction in the cost 
of renewable energy technologies over the 
past decade, governments have continued 
to search for renewables projects to benefit 
from economies of scale. 
 
Global average prices have dropped from 
approximately USD 241/megawatt hour (MWh) to
USD 66/MWh for solar photovoltaic (PV), 
while onshore wind prices have dropped from 
approximately USD 79/MWh to USD 46/MWh. 
Solar PV prices continued to fall between 2017 and 
2018, albeit at a slower pace, reaching USD 62/MWh 
in 2018. Onshore wind prices have edged slightly 
upward, reaching USD 55/MWh. The Middle East/
North Africa region has seen remarkably low prices 
for new renewable energy projects, especially solar 
PV. Tunisia, itself, recorded the lowest bid in Africa 
for a 500 MW solar PV tender at USD 0.0244/kWh 
(pvmagazine, 2019a).
3. Environmental: Tunisia, in its NDCs, has included 
measures to reduce its carbon intensity with a 
focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 
41%, with 75% of these reductions stemming from 
mitigation measures in renewable energy and 
energy efficiency. The development of renewable 
energy is a central pillar of decarbonising the 
energy mix while securing a reliable energy supply. 
In 2018 alone, renewable energy generation from 
solar PV and wind avoided nearly 1.5 million tonnes 
of carbon emissions.
Moreover, around 20 energy efficiency actions 
have been included in the calculation of avoidable 
emissions, covering the industrial, building, transport 
and agriculture sectors. This commitment is well 
reflected in the TSP, and the country has taken 
measures to build institutional capacity and further 
address the planning gaps from the first round to the 
second round of NDC reviews in 2020 (UNDP, 2018a).
In 2017, ANME initiated work on a low carbon 
strategy to 2050 that would include carbon pricing 
instruments. The Partnership for Market Readiness, 
United Nations Development Programme and World 
Bank are supporting Tunisia in the implementation of 
its NDC and low carbon strategy. ENABLING ENVIRONMENT FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY

Tunisian Solar Plan
The TSP is the operational tool to implement the 
Tunisian strategy for the deployment of renewables in 
the power sector. As such, it focuses only on on-grid 
electricity generation, based on wind, solar PV, CSP 
and biomass. The first version of the TSP was launched 
in 2009. The present version is the result of several 
improvements made over the years to reflect Tunisia’s 
national strategy and targets. It was finalised by ANME 
in 2015 and adopted by the Tunisian government in 
July 2016. Tunisia took note of the notable progress in 
renewable energy deployment In December 2017, and 
has further updated and extended the targets to 2022. 
To achieve the objectives of the national strategy, the 
TSP has set a total capacity for renewable electricity 
generation of 1 860 MW by 2022 and 3 815 MW by 
2030, in comparison to the installed 373 MW renewable 
energy in 2018 (IRENA, 2020b). The distribution of 
projected capacity between the different renewable 
technologies is shown in Figure 16.ENABLING ENVIRONMENT FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY
3.2 Renewable energy resources
and exploitation
Tunisia is endowed with abundant renewable energy 
resources, particularly solar and wind energy; 
however, renewable energy currently plays a minor 
role in the country’s energy supply. Tunisia’s total 
installed renewable power generating capacity had 
reached approximately 352 MW by the end of 2019, 
with wind energy at 245 MW, hydropower at 66 MW) 
and PV at 62 MW (IRENA, 2020b). The use of solar 
thermal energy for heating water can be regarded 
as a success story, with a total installed area of
980 000 square metres (m2) at the end of 2017 
(ANME, 2018).
Wind energy 
Wind resources were evaluated by ANME in 2009 in 
collaboration with Spain’s National Renewable Energy 
Centre (Centro Nacional de Energias Renovables). 
This was possible through the development of a wind 
atlas for the entire country (Figure 18). 
Tunisia’s wind map illustrates the existence of several 
suitable sites for wind farms. The most interesting 
sites (speed exceeding 7 metres per second (m/s) at 
80 metres height) are found in the regions of Bizerte 
and Nabeul, in the central region (Kasserine) and in 
the southern regions (Tataouine, Western Cape, Gabes 
and Kebili). 
By comparison, sites with less attractive wind 
conditions (speed between 6.5 m/s and 7 m/s) can be 
found in the eastern areas of Tozeur, the east coast of 
Medenine and the Monastir region (IRENA, n.d).
The total area available for wind power development 
is estimated to be about 32 200 km². The gross wind 
energy potential in Tunisia is estimated at more than
8 000 MW (GIZ, 2013). This potential does not consider 
potential development opportunities in offshore wind.
Tunisia’s wind generation development began 
in 2001, when STEG brought online a wind farm 
at the Sidi Daoud site in the northeast, with an 
initial capacity of 10 MW and later expanding to 
55 MW in 2008. The wind farm of Sidi Daoud is 
comprised of three diverse wind turbine profiles: 
two small turbine models of 300 kilowatts and
800 kilowatts, and larger turbines of 1.32 MW 
(RES4MED, 2016).
STEG launched two other wind farms in 2012 at 
the sites of Metline and Kchabta (Bizerte region). 
Together they account for a total of 143 wind turbines 
with a total capacity of 190 MW. The total electricity 
production of the three wind farms installed by STEG 
in 2017 reached 449 GWh, and peak production was 
recorded in 2014 at 507 GWh, as shown in Figure 17.

Electricity generation (GWh)
Solar energy 
Tunisia has solar resources exceeding 3000 hours/year, 
although hours of sunshine vary throughout the 
different regions. Most of the southern provinces have 
a solar exposure time of more than 3 200 hours/year, 
with peaks of 3 400 hours/year on the south coast (Gulf 
of Gabes), while the minimum period of insolation in 
the northern provinces is between 2 500 and 3 000 
full-sun hours equivalent (Renewable and Sustainable 
Energy Reviews, April 2016). Solar irradiation 
ranges from 1 800 kWh/m2/year in the north to
2 600 kWh/m2/year in the south. 
Global horizontal irradiance is a reliable resource 
measure for solar PV installations. As shown in 
Figure 20, the daily average global solar irradiance is 
between 4.2 kWh/m2/day in the northwest of Tunisia 
and 5.8 kWh/m2/day in its far south. 
With these favourable conditions, the productivity of 
PV solar systems in Tunisia is very high. According to 
IRENA’s Global Atlas, annual electricity production 
by PV solar systems varies between 1 450 kWh per 
kilowatt-peak (kWp) in the northwest region and
1 830 kWh/kWp for systems installed in the extreme
southeast region.
Direct normal irradiance (DNI) is the main parameter for 
evaluating the potential for concentrated solar power 
(CSP) technology. Generally, the DNI should be at least 
2000 kWh/m2/year to provide a viable energy yield. 
In Tunisia, as shown in Figure 21, direct solar irradiation 
in the south and in most of the central region exceeds 
this typical DNI value. The DNI in some regions of the 
extreme southeast of Tunisia can reach a value of
2 300 kWh/m2 /year. ENABLING ENVIRONMENT FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY

TunisiaSolar PV 
The use of solar PV systems in Tunisia began with 
decentralised rural electrification and pumping 
for drinking water supply, supporting low-income 
populations with very high subsidies. Only about 100 
pumping stations, concentrated in the south of the 
country, have been installed. Tunisia had about 13 200 
rural households electrified by PV systems by the end 
of 2014, totalling an installed capacity of approximately 
1 450 kWp. Despite this advancement, no information 
is currently available on the real operating number of 
systems, as there is no monitoring procedure. Solar 
PV systems for decentralised rural electrification 
have minimal potential, given that STEG’s 
electricity network covers most remote areas, while
limited potential exists for pumping for small-scale 
irrigation. 
Grid-connected solar PV systems are recent in 
Tunisia. Their installation started upon the issuance 
of Law No. 2009-7, which authorises self-production 
of electricity from renewable energy sources. Gridconnected solar PV has mainly been implemented 
through the Prosol électrique programme, initiated in 
May 2010 by ANME and STEG.
The financial mechanism for this programme, 
exclusively intended for residential consumers 
connected to the LV grid, combines subsidies granted 
by the FTE and loans repaid over a period of seven 
years via the consumer’s STEG electricity bill.
By the end of 2019, 3 644 solar PV systems were 
connected to the LV grid. The total PV capacity 
installed is evaluated at around 11 298 kWp, 90% of 
which were installed in the residential sector. Figure 
22 illustrates the evolution of the cumulative solar PV 
capacity connected to the LV grid.
With continuing increases in electricity rates and the 
significant price decline of PV systems, the profitability 
of solar energy continues to improve for all electricity 
consumers, including those connected to the MV grid. 
In this context and until February 2020, MIEM has 
granted the necessary authorisation for 150 solar PV 
installations, totalling a capacity of approximately
26 megawatts-peak (MWp), with intended for
production to the MV grid (ANME, 2020). The distribution 
of the PV energy projects is largely in the agriculture 
sector, followed by the industry and tertiary sectors, with 
64% of the installations below 100-kilowatt capacity.

Solar PV demand in Tunisia has led to the creation of 
a network of companies specialising in the installation 
of PV systems. By the end of 2019, ANME listed 350 
registered companies, among which 150 were active. In 
addition, five manufacturing units for PV modules were 
created in Tunisia during the period 2011–2019, with an 
annual production capacity estimated at 100 MW.
Concentrated solar power 
Studies by DESERTEC found the gross 
potential of CSP plants in Tunisia to vary 
with irradiation from 50 gigawatts (GW) to
1 250  GW. But with limited water available for 
cooling, this falls to between 4 GW and 65 GW 
(mitigationmomentum2016)
Currently, Tunisia does not have any CSP generation 
plants. A pre-feasibility study was conducted in 2009, 
however, for a 50–100 MW capacity CSP project in the 
region of Gabes (Oued Akarit).
Separately, an ambitious project was presented, by a 
private company, to the Tunisian government in 2008 
to build a CSP plant in southern Tunisia and export 
its electricity production to Europe: the TuNur CSP 
Project. The proposed project consists of a 2 250 MW 
solar CSP plant in the Sahara Desert and a 2 GW HV 
direct-current submarine cable from Tunisia to Italy 
(Figure 26).

The solar water heating (SWH) sector in Tunisia was 
initiated in the 1980s through the creation, in 1982, of 
the first manufacturing unit for solar water heaters and 
the establishment of a specific consumer credit system. 
Hindered by technical skill levels, however, the country 
experienced a sharp decline in annual installations from 
approximately 5000 m²/year installed collector area to 
only several hundred square metres in the mid-1990s. 
The market was revived through a Global Environmental 
Facility project that provided a grant of up to 35% of 
the purchase price and the establishment of technical 
requirements and guarantees for solar water heaters 
sold on the market to restore consumer confidence in 
SWH technology
The project helped revitalise the market, restore 
the technology’s reputation and create a more 
competitive local business. The project stopped 
in late 2001, however, with the depletion of the 
funds reserved for the grant (USD 6.6 million). 
The market then declined significantly to less than
8000 m2 in 2004.
As of 2005 the Tunisian government decided to 
boost the SWH market by implementing the Prosol 
programme, based on an innovative financing 
and incentive mechanism. The programme offers 
capital grants combined with value-added tax 
exemption, reduction of custom duties and reduced 
interest loans paid back through electricity bills

This programme transformed the Tunisian SWH market 
whereby, by 2008, the annual installed area of solar 
water heaters in the residential sector had reached 
more than ten times the average recorded prior to the 
start of the Prosol programme. 
After reaching an annual peak of 80000 m2 during the 
period 2008–2010, the market registered a decrease in 
2011. The total collector’s area installed under the Prosol 
since its start in 2005, however, is about 885000 m². 
Figure 27 illustrates the evolution of annual and 
cumulative solar collector area installed under Prosol.
A programme specific to the commercial and industrial 
sector also was established in 2009, named Tertiary 
Prosol, which had installed around 28000 m² of solar 
collectors by the end of 2016. This specific programme 
has not experienced the same dynamic as in the 
residential sector; the payback period often is not 
attractive for end users in the tertiary sector due to 
competition from heavily subsidised natural gas.
From the commercialisation of SWH systems in 1982 
until the end of 2018, the cumulative total area of 
solar collectors installed in Tunisia is estimated at
1 040 000 m², as shown in Figure 28. The evolution of 
SWH has been accompanied by a significant growth 
in the number of suppliers, installation companies and 
equipment models sold on the Tunisian market. 
The SWH market offer at the end of 2016 was 
characterised by the presence of:
• 53 suppliers, including ten local manufacturers;
• 1 200 installers, of which 500 were qualified, 
according to the Qualisol label6
 established by 
ANME;
• 250 approved models of SWH systems;
• 16 engineering consulting firms;
• 12 qualified installation companies of collective solar 
heating systems; and
• three technical control offices.
Hydropower
Hydropower was the first renewable resource 
exploited in Tunisia through the installation of 
two hydropower stations in Arroussia and Nebeur 
(northwest region) in 1956, with a total capacity of
18 MW.

water heaters
Its installed hydro capacity by 2018 stood at
66 MW, spread over seven stations, as shown in
Table 9.
Tunisia does not have large dams and its hydraulic 
energy potential is limited. The production of 
hydropower is variable, and its share of total electricity 
production is very limited, as shown in Figure 29. 
Electricity produced from hydropower in 2018 totalled 
approximately 18 GWh, which represented 0.12% of 
STEG electricity production.Figure 28. Annual hydropower production, Tunisia, 2005–2018

Annual hydropower production (GWh)
Biofuels and waste-to-energy 
There is minimal use of traditional biomass fuels in 
Tunisia as almost the entire country has access to 
electricity and to non-solid fuels for cooking. The 
production of charcoal has remained almost stable 
over the last decade, averaging 150 ktoe/year, and 
wood is frequently used in traditional ovens.
The National Waste Management Agency (ANGED – 
Agence Nationale de Gestion des Déchets) estimates that 
the country produces approximately 6 million tonnes of 
organic waste annually (2.2 million tonnes of household 
waste, 2.2 million tonnes from farms and agri-industry,
1 million tonnes from olive oil processing, 400 000 tonnes 
from poultry droppings and 200 000 tonnes from waste 
water treatment). According to ANGED, the potential 
for generating electricity through waste is estimated 
at 1000 GWh/year. Various challenges currently exist 
to exploit this potential, including initial investment 
cost constraints, a lack of technical knowledge, limited 
knowledge on biomass resources, lack of clarity on 
the long-term supply of power plants from low-cost 
waste, and overlapping roles between ANGED and 
municipalities, both responsible for waste collection. 
One pilot biogas plant capable of generating
2.4 GWh/year of electricity was developed in 2010. 
The plant is set up to use waste from the wholesale 
market of Bir El Kassaa; however, it remains offline 
due to technical problems (ANME, 2017).
Geothermal energy
The southern part of the country, specifically the 
Kebili, Gabes and Tozeur regions, is rich in hot springs 
- a good indicator of geothermal activity. These 
geothermal resources originate from the extensive 
Continental Intercalary aquifer, covering an area of 
1 million km2
 and spreading into the neighbouring 
countries of Libya and Algeria. The aquifer is about 
2.8 km deep and has temperatures ranging from 30°C 
to 80°C (UN, 2008). 
Use of geothermal energy in the power sector, 
however, is underdeveloped due to the low enthalpy 
of geothermal resources. Therefore, many geothermal 
applications are based on direct use of geothermal 
heat in agriculture (e.g. for heating greenhouses, 
powering irrigation pumps) and recreational thermal 
baths.ENABLING ENVIRONMENT FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY
3.3 Renewable energy regulatory framework
The first regulatory framework allowing for the use 
of renewable energy to produce electricity was 
set up in 2009 through the promulgation of Law 
No. 2009-7 (adopted 9 February 2009). This law 
authorises households, companies and groups of 
companies active in different economic sectors to 
exploit renewable resources to produce electricity to 
cover their needs. The law provides the possibility for 
companies connected to the MV and HV grids to sell 
their production surpluses to STEG. The requirements 
and procedures for these projects were set by Decree 
No. 2009-2773 (28 September 2009) (MEMTE, 2016).
Aware of the need to establish regulatory reforms to 
mobilise private investment for the development of 
renewable energy, the Tunisian government began 
discussions in 2012 to put in place a new legislative 
framework more attractive to various kinds of private 
developers.
In 2015 Tunisia adopted a new legislation relating to 
electricity sources from clean energy developments. 
Law No. 12 of 11 May 2015, relating to electricity
produced from renewable energy sources, was 
implemented to promote the development of 
renewable energy, encourage private-sector 
investment and liberalise rules regarding the 
production (and export) of clean energy. This new law 
provides for three regulatory regimes, as follows. 
• Production projects for self-consumption
• IPPs to meet the needs of local consumption
• IPPs intended for export.
This law provides several legal texts that are essential 
for its implementation (i.e. decree, order, decision). 
Currently, the regulatory framework for electricity 
generation from renewable energy is defined through 
the key texts outlined in Table 10.

Box 3. Addressing power system flexibility 
in Tunisia
Tunisia has set ambitious renewable energy targets 
in its Tunisia Solar Plan (TSP) for the year 2030. A 
national plan to maintain grid stability is essential, 
taking curtailment into account, as the current grid 
may need to be reinforced to handle additional 
capacity from renewable energy sources due to 
current grid infrastructure limitations. This will 
become a major concern when large-scale projects 
under the concession scheme come online. 
In this context, IRENA’s analysis in Power System 
Flexibility for the Energy Transition finds that, for the 
effective management of large-scale VRE, several 
flexibility sources need to be exploited and planned 
for ahead of time. 
Flexibility in the energy system can be provided 
by different sectors, including transmission and 
distribution systems, storage and more flexible 
demand (demand-side management and sector 
coupling). Therefore, proper planning methodologies 
need to be undertaken to integrate all energy system 
players, including both technical and institutional 
aspects. Figure 25 shows the different flexibility 
measures that may be taken at different timescales 
to address VRE curtailment. In this context, China has 
integrated different measures to address curtailment, 
including the improvement of operational practices, 
implementation of wholesale energy markets, grid 
infrastructure development, integration of demandside programmes with a focus on interruptible loads 
and pumped hydro solutions (IRENA, 2018a).
IRENA finds that planning for flexibility is a 
complex multi-step process that requires significant 
mathematical computation using the appropriate 
tools. As such, IRENA has developed the Flex tool to 
assess the current flexibility of the power system in 
different countries. The Flex tool is a user-friendly tool 
that analyses the power system holistically, considering 
traditional and innovative technologies that enrich the 
concept of flexibility, including flexible demand, energy 
storage and sector coupling. Moreover, the Flex Tool 
can be used to carry out long-term analysis, proposing 
various solutions to Tunisia’s goal of including 30% 
renewables in its future power system by 2030. 
Addressing variable renewable energy in long-term 
planning comes as a timely assessment, as MIEM is 
currently drafting the updated national plan for the 
years 2021 – 2025, as stipulated by articles 40 and 
43 of law No. 2015-12. The plan is expected to include 
disaggregated renewable energy targets defined for 
each production regime. IRENA’s FlexTool analysis 
aims to help the MIEM assess different flexibility 
solutions to enable Tunisia to reach key goals and 
fulfil the TSP.

grid, key items under Law No. 2015-12 must be 
accounted for. These include power system flexibility 
for the integration of variable renewable energy 
(VRE) onto the grid. Current grid infrastructure 
and operations accommodate the current share 
of renewables in the grid, which is at 2.5%. The 
TSP expects a share of 30% by 2030, however, 
and therefore further measures must be taken. 
In this context, Article 3, Article 4 and Article 40
of Law No. 2015-12 account for power flexibility 
measures. 
Law No. 2015-12 requires the creation of a national 
plan to produce renewable electricity. MIEM, in 
consultation with the national council of energy, 
is responsible for developing a national plan for 
electricity generation from renewable energy.
Article 3 of Chapter II of the law lists the requirements 
of the national plan (i.e. grid stability, consistency 
in supply and demand, reserves, rate of industrial 
integration, and inventory zones), while Article 4 of 
Chapter II sets out the process for agreement of the 
national plan. 
The approval of the plan by government decree on a 
proposal by MIEM is followed by agreement from the 
ministers in charge of finance, national defence, state 
property, agriculture, environment, equipment and 
local communities. 
Meanwhile, Article 40 of Chapter VI deals with the 
timing of the national plan: it must be finalised and 
approved within five years from the date of the law’s 
entry into force. The plan will include disaggregated 
renewable energy capacity targets by technology and 
production regime.
Self-consumption scheme
The main regulatory and administrative provisions for 
renewable energy production for self-consumption 
vary according to the nature of the project, with the 
primary distinction being between projects connected 
to the LV grid or the MV grid (Table 12).

Table 12. Provisions for self-consumption projects connected to low- and medium-voltage grids,
Tunisia
Sources: MDICI (2017); ANME (2014).Authorisation scheme
Under the Authorisation scheme, energy-selling 
projects can be initiated subject to meeting all the 
regulatory and technical requirements, with final 
approval from MIEM. The agreements are granted 
within the limit of the overall installed capacity defined 
in the annual notice relating to the renewable capacity 
to be achieved through the authorisation system.
Following lengthy discussions regarding the 
guaranteed purchase tariffs and the modalities of their 
application and revision, however, the decision was 
taken to grant authorisations only based on calls for 
projects announced by MIEM and within the limits of 
the objectives set by the annual notice. According to 
this approach, electricity sales prices are not fixed and, 
instead, are offered by private developers interested 
in participating in calls for projects. Figure 30 sets 
out the procedure applied under the Authorisation 
scheme. 
Power purchase agreements
The PPA is an essential formal consensus that governs 
the power transaction between the renewable energy 
producer and the off-taker, serving as a key element 
of project bankability. PPAs should be designed to 
be relevant to country context for private project 
developers and government alike. Accordingly, Tunisia 
has developed bankable documentation (projects 
agreements), including a standard PPA form under 
the Authorisation and Concession schemes, approved 
under the decision of 30 August 2018 (repealing that 
of 9 February 2017) by MIEM. 
As such, the PPA between developer and utility must 
include the following key items (MEMTE, 2017b): 
• Contract term: Initial term of 20 years, with a take 
or pay mechanism.
• Tariffs: Individually determined, based on offer 
made by developer.
• Connection costs: Developer’s responsibility, 
including initial connection and reinforcement costs.
• Technical requirements: Electricity produced is 
supplied in line with connection codes, approved by 
the ministry.
• Force Majeure: No compensation is available under 
the PPA for either party affected in the context. 
STEG is entitled to suspend performance under 
political force majeure.
• Transfer conditions: Capital transfers are allowed, 
subject to approval by MIEM.
In addition to the PPA, several other key documents are 
required: agreements on implementation, operation 
and maintenance, supply and installation, as well as 
finance facility term sheets. In this context IRENA, 
together with the Terrawatt Initiative, launched 
the Open Solar Contracts project to standardise 
contracts and thereby simplify and streamline project 
development and finance practices. In this regard, the 
Open Solar Contracts project will reduce risk, save time 
and unlock greater investment by providing confidence 
to the project developers (IRENA, 2018a).

The scheme procedure is outlined in Figure 31. 
3.4 Renewable energy 
institutional framework
Several institutions involved in electricity governance 
are responsible for renewable energy deployment. 
There are various support mechanisms for the 
deployment of renewable energy, from setting an 
enabling strategy and regulatory framework, to 
providing support for schemes in the form of grants 
and subsidies (further details on the energy-relevant 
institutions and their respective roles are presented in 
Annex I). 
Furthermore, several associations and institutions are 
active in the field of vocational training, including the 
following:
The National Centre for Continuous Vocational 
Training and Professional Promotion (Centre 
National de Formation Continue et de Promotion 
Professionnelle) is responsible for managing the 1.5% 
of tax revenues set aside for the vocational training of 
professionals in the field of renewable energy.
The National Centre for Instructor Training and 
Training Development (Centre National de Formation 
de Formateurs et d’Ingénierie de Formation) and 
the Mechanical and Electrical Industries Technical 
Centre (Centre Technique des Industries Mécaniques 
et Electriques) are responsible for developing training 
programmes and products to disseminate the 
necessary knowledge to build competency and skills. 
In the field of certification and standardisation, the 
National Institute of Standardisation and Industrial 
Property (Institut National de la Normalisation et de 
la Propriété Industrielle) is responsible for standards 
development, certifying compliance and ensuring the 
Tunisian national certification system accords to ISO 
standards. 
Renewable energy programmes and project 
pipeline 
Following the completion of the renewable energy 
regulatory framework, MIEM made an announcement 
in January 2017 that it would adjust the renewable 
electricity capacity to be installed during the period 2017–
2020. According to this announcement, the production 
programme for the period 2017–2020 is limited to solar 
PV and wind energy, and aims to achieve an additional 
capacity of 1000 MW. The same document sets the 
additional capacity to be installed during the period 
2020–2025 at 1 250 MW. It also specifies that a portion 
of this capacity may be advanced and implemented 
during the period 2017–2020.7
7 Tunisia updated the targets in the TSP in May 2019 to accurately reflect the current targets and progress undertaken in the country.The renewable electricity generation programme for 
the period 2017–2020 was updated in April 2018 by 
MIEM. According to this adjustment, the power level 
to be achieved during this period was set at 1 860 MW 
instead of the 1 000 MW initially planned. The largest 
capacity increase was recorded for projects under 
concessions, as shown in Table 13. 
Notably, the upward revision of renewable energy 
capacity for the period 2017–2020 was decided after 
a national conference in Tunis on 7-8 December 2017. 
Discussion took place on the possibility of accelerating 
the implementation of the TSP. By increasing the 
capacity for concessions, the Tunisian government 
seeks mainly to cut costs via economies of scale.
In 2019, the renewable energy targets set in the TSP 
were updated and extended to 2022. 
MIEM launched pre-qualification tenders on 23 May 
2018 for the realisation by concession (build, own, 
operate) of five solar PV plants, totalling a capacity 
of 500 MW, and four wind farms with a total capacity 
of 500 MW. The sites planned for these projects 
already have been selected and they mostly belong 
to the state, except for 200 MW of wind, for which 
the land should be proposed by the developers 
with a maximum capacity of 100 MW per project. 
The geographical distribution of solar PV and wind 
concessions is provided in Table 14.

MIEM announced on 23 November 2018 the list of 
developers who pre-qualified to participate in two 
private tenders for the concession of PV and wind 
power plants (Refere, 2018). The pre-qualified lists 
include:
• 16 companies and consortia for the concession of 
PV power plants on state land;
• 12 companies for the concession of wind farms on 
state lands; and
• private sites - still pending.
Candidates were invited to present bids for a 20-
year concession contract at the start of 2019 with 
energy sales to STEG (ANSAmed, n.d.). Despite the 
delay in the bidding process, five bids were received 
for the 500 MW solar tender. The proposed bids 
were all within the range of USD 0.0244/kWh to
USD 0.0286/kWh (MEMTE, 2019a). While all the 
bids received were below USD 0.03/kWh, the
USD 0.0244/kWh bid tendered by Scatec Solar for the 
200 MW Tataouine project (Table 14) was the lowest 
bid recorded in Africa (MEMTE, 2019a). 
For renewable projects under the Authorisation 
scheme, MISME proceeded in May 2017 to launch 
the first call for projects for the development of
210 MW from solar PV and wind. For projects under 
authorisation in May 2018, the capacity of wind power 
plants should not exceed 30 MW, and the maximum 
capacity of PV power plants was set at 10 MW. The 
breakdown of renewable energy plants covered by 
this first call for projects under the Authorisation 
scheme is provided in Table 15.
Solar photovoltaic proposals under 
Authorisation scheme
The evaluation results of the proposals that came 
out of this call for projects allowed the selection of 
six solar PV projects, with a unit capacity of 10 MW, 
and four projects of 1 MW capacity. The proposed 
tariffs vary from USD cents 4.6/kWh to USD cent
6.9/kWh for the 10 MW solar plants and from USD cents
6.7/kWh to USD cents 9.7/kWh for the solar plants of 
1 MW capacity (MEMTE, 2018d). 
All project sites were proposed by the selected 
developers. Preliminary studies carried out by STEG 
have confirmed the possibility of connecting these 
plants to the electricity grid and have estimated the 
costs required for this connection. The solar projects 
selected following the first call for projects will be 
located on different sites in the regions of Sidi Bouzid, 
Kairouan, Sfax, Kasserine, Tataouine, Gafsa and Beja.
MIEM launched a second call on 30 May 2018 for 
projects for solar PV power plants with a total capacity 
of 70 MW; 60 MW for projects with a maximum 
capacity of 10 MW; and 10 MW for solar PV plants 
with a capacity not exceeding 1 MW. The deadline for 
submitting applications was set for 15 August 2018, 
which was extended to April 2018, and the results 
were announced in April 2019 with an average tariff of 
4.5 cents (USD 0.045)/kWh for projects with 10 MW 
capacity and 7.2 cents (USD 0.072)/kWh for projects 
with a capacity of 1 MW (MEMTE, 2019b).
Under the Authorisation scheme, Tunisia has initiated 
a third tender for the development and construction 
of several solar power plants not exceeding 10 MW in 
size (MEMTE, 2019c).

For wind projects, proposals received for the first 
round were conditional on changes being made to the 
terms of the PPA. As a result, bidding companies were 
invited to submit new proposals by 18 December 2018 
(an extension from the initial deadline of 15 August 
2018), based on the new PPA that was approved by 
order on 30 August 2018 and published in Tunisia’s 
Official Gazette on 28 September 2018.
Results were announced on 10 January 2019 and four 
authorisations were granted with an average of tariff 
received of 4.26 cents (USD 0.0426) /kWh (MEMTE, 
2019d). 
STEG renewable energy projects 
STEG designed a programme for its future renewable 
energy development in the period 2017–2022. STEG 
began building a solar PV power plant in 2017 with 
a capacity of 10 MW (extended to 20 MW) in Tozeur, 
southeast Tunisia. The first 10 MW was commissioned 
in the beginning of 2020 while the latter 10 MW is 
under construction.
According to the notice published by MIEM, the total 
capacity of the renewable energy plants to be built 
by STEG during the period 2017–2022 amount to 
380 MW, of which 300 MW comprise solar PV and
80 MW comprise wind energy. STEG has completed 
the preliminary studies for these plants and the 
selection of their sites. 
3.5 Financial initiatives for 
renewable energy
The FTE is the specific instrument for the financial 
support of energy policy in Tunisia. It was established 
by the Finance Law No. 54-2013 of 30 December 
2013 (article 67 -68) to replace the National Fund for 
Energy Management, created in 2005, and whose 
field of action was limited to the granting of direct 
subsidies for certain energy management actions. 
Through the creation of this new fund, the Tunisian 
state seeks to boost the country’s energy transition 
through diversification by providing funding to:
• encourage investment in the field of energy 
conservation;
• support the creation and promotion of energy 
companies;
• facilitate the implementation of national programmes 
contributing to energy conservation; and
• support the implementation of the NDC through 
the provision of smart subsidies, loans and equity.
The FTE is funded by several resources, including:
• taxes on the first registration of cars;
• taxes on air-conditioning appliances;
• taxes on energy products consumed;
• taxes on used engine and spare part imports;
• donations and grants from individuals and legal 
entities to the fund; and
• resources from the fund’s interventions.
The FTE also may be financed through other resources 
that can be allocated for its benefit, including funding 
provided by international development funds. 
The rules governing the organisation, functioning 
and modalities of FTE intervention were fixed by 
Governmental Decree No. 2017-983 of 26 July 2017. In 
accordance with this decree, the support provided by 
the FTE may be provided in the form of:
• direct subsidies for tangible and intangible 
investments;
• additional credits to loans granted by banking 
institutions;investment funding in the form of 
equity investment; and

• funding of national projects and programmes 
initiated by the state and local communities.
The amounts of the various subsidies provided by 
the FTE are defined usually as a percentage of the 
cost of the investment, with a ceiling amount defined 
according to the purpose of the investment. The FTE 
may also provide subsidised loans for renewable 
energy projects. The conditions for receiving these 
loans are as follows:
• The need for a bank to participate in the financing 
of the project.
• The maximum amount of the FTE loan must not 
exceed 50% of the cost of the investment.
• The amount of the FTE loan must not exceed the 
amount of credit granted by the bank.
• The repayment period of the loan must not exceed 
seven years.
• The maximum grace period is two years.
Despite the publication of the decree setting out 
the FTE’s available interventions being July 2017, 
the technicalities of supporting the fund through 
additional loans and repayable endowments or 
participation in the capital market have yet to be 
defined, and its current intervention is limited to the 
granting of subsidies.
While the FTE’s support is limited to the provision 
of subsidies, a new fund has been established under 
Law No. 2016-71 - the Tunisian Investment Fund (FTE) 
which enables the provision of grants and loans for 
new investment projects. In the renewable energy 
context, projects under the Authorisation scheme are 
eligible to receive incentives from this fund, subject to 
site-specific criteria.
The grants provided vary between 15% and 30% 
of the cost of the investment, ranging between 
USD 390 000 and USD 1 170 000, respectively. 
The different rates and amounts of subsidies and 
additional loans accorded by the FTE in 2018 for 
renewable energy are summarised in Table 17.

Sources: MDICI (2017); ANME (2014).Key challenges and 
recommendations 
Conscious of the vulnerability and dependency of its energy situation, Tunisia has 
set ambitious targets for the development of renewable energy, particularly in the 
power sector.
To achieve these objectives, Tunisia has undertaken several measures, including:
• adoption of the TSP;
• creation of an independent regulatory authority for the electricity sector to 
enhance the framework for the mobilisation of renewable energy investment; 
• development of innovative financing tools for promoting renewables in the 
residential sector; and
• strengthening of the FTE.
Despite the recent reforms to encourage the involvement of the private sector 
and accelerate the realisation of national objectives, there are several barriers that 
continue to hold back more accelerated renewables deployment. The next section 
presents the main challenges and the corresponding recommended actions to 
overcome them, a result of the RRA process.
4.1 Long-term energy planning
Achieving higher shares of renewable energy in the electricity mix - as well as 
successful integration of VREs such as wind and solar energy - into the national 
electricity grid requires an integrated long-term energy planning process. Several 
key factors should be considered, including:
• evolution of electricity demand and the corresponding electricity production 
and transmission infrastructure;
• capacity of the current electricity grid to accommodate higher shares of 
renewables and the need for its reinforcement;
• renewable energy potential in different application segments (utility scale, 
remote decentralised systems and cities);
• land availability and access; and
• topographical constraints and limitations. 
Yet, Tunisia does not have a solid long-term timeframe to account for capacity 
additions. The integrated planning for the period 2017–2022 was set mainly by MIEM 
with reference to the objectives of the TSP. The preparatory phase of this programme 
did not include all the relevant stakeholders and did not consider the various aspects 
relating to the implementation of energy planningsuch as access to landKEY CHALLENGES AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Furthermore, Law No. 2015–12 calls for a national plan 
to produce renewable electricity within five years from 
the date the law entered into force. The national plan 
will have to be data driven; include a holistic evaluation 
of different renewable energy technologies; and 
ideally consider a mix of renewable power generation 
assets that include utility-scale power plants, remote 
decentralised grids, and residential distributed 
systems. With respect to utility-scale generation 
targets, the zones currently allocated for concessions 
could be a starting point. A comprehensive leastcost assessment for the development of generation 
assets, however, is yet to be developed, in addition 
to a corresponding assessment of the cost of 
reinforcing the electricity grid. Such a plan is yet to 
be developed although, in 2018, ANME initiated the 
preparatory phase to define the necessary studies for 
the development of this plan.
Moreover, to meet the ambitious targets of the TSP (i.e. 
30% renewable share in the electricity mix) - coupled 
with the reduction in the cost of VRE, solar and wind 
power deployment - is likely to increase, particularly 
when the concession schemes come online. Achieving 
these ambitious targets will require corresponding 
investments in the grid to maintain reliability and 
avoid curtailment. Fortunately, numerous new 
technologies and approaches are available that can 
ease the integration of variable renewables (wind and 
solar PV) into electricity systems (IRENA, 2019b).
Establish an energy planning framework with 
higher shares of renewables
The long-term energy planning process must be 
solidified through a participatory approach involving 
a range of stakeholders, thereby ensuring stronger 
institutional buy-in and rapid resolution of possible 
constraints. The plan may also address electricity grid 
infrastructure development that will help smooth the 
integration of VRE into the system. The plan should 
provide long-term visibility on renewable energy 
development prospects in Tunisia.
Within the planning framework, the monitoring 
system also must be evaluated and revised as needed 
to permit regular updates, taking into account 
implementation constraints, technological advances, 
economies of scale and national climate pledges. With 
rapidly decreasing costs, storage brings substantial 
value for grid management as a stand-alone asset, as 
well as when integrated with renewable power supply. 
When deployed as part of a holistic strategy storage, 
coupled with sector coupling, also has the potential 
to reduce the investment needs in transmission and 
distribution infrastructure to integrate higher shares 
Consider adopting renewable energy targets 
for end-use sectors 
While renewable energy penetration in the power 
sector has been the government’s priority, strong 
and clear targets for renewables deployment in enduse sectors would signal the political commitment of 
the government to the public, investors, international 
institutions and other relevant stakeholders. This also 
applies to end users in the industrial and residential 
heating and cooling, along with the transport sectors.
As a first step, the potential and feasibility for the 
deployment of various technology options in end-use 
sectors could be assessed, including, electrification 
of end-use sectors (see Annex I). As the second 
step, IRENA finds that policies are the main driver 
for the uptake of renewables in end-use sectors, 
where government programmes would pave the way 
for robust engagement by the private sector in the 
long-term by promoting competition and innovation 
in deployment. In general, push, pull and integrated 
policies, such as mandates and taxes, coupled with 
financial instruments for research, development and 
demonstration as well as specific sector targets, would 
stimulate behavioural and market growth (IRENA, IEA 
and REN21, 2018).
Improve the mapping of renewable energy 
resources
The long-term planning process requires the 
establishment of a solid resource database provided 
by the detailed zoning of the renewable energy 
resources across the country, particularly for solar and 
wind energy. A genuine resource mapping process 
should include, but not be limited to:
• quantitative assessment of resource potential for 
various renewable energy resources;
• distance to the grid and the nearest sub-station;
• distance to load centres;
• environmentally sensitive areas; and
• land topography.
In this context, IRENA - with its regional partners 
the Regional Centre for Renewable Energy and 
Energy Efficiency (RCREEE) and the League of Arab 
States (LAS) are currently supporting every country 
in the region, at an operational level, to build solid 
foundations for the uptake of renewables. The partnership is conducting a zoning and suitability 
study for utility-scale and decentralised solar and wind 
applications to harness the datasets and methods 
developed through the Global Atlas initiative. The 
study would combine the resource quality with 
local constraining criteria, such as the transmission 
distance and load centres, to provide insight into the 
theoretical installable capacity and prospective zones 
in each case for long-term planning to accommodate 
high shares of VRE, policy and regulatory regime 
planning.
Additional analyses would assess the financial viability 
of identified resource-rich areas, such as estimated 
investment needs and the levelised cost of electricity. 
In the urban context, 3D building rooftop and resource 
irradiation models may assist in identifying the optimal 
business and policy models required to activate this 
market.
Simplify procurement procedures for power 
grid development
STEG is currently developing studies for the 
development and reinforcement of the national 
electricity grid infrastructure to align renewable 
generation development with grid infrastructure 
reinforcement to enable smooth integration of 
renewable electricity. These studies would identify the 
necessary grid infrastructure development scenarios 
needed, based on planned solar and wind electricity 
capacity additions to the grid, reaching to 1 000 MW 
as per current plans. 
The implementation of grid infrastructure projects 
by STEG, however, is subject to lengthy public 
procurement procedures, delaying the evacuation 
of electricity from the completed renewable energy 
projects. Simplification and streamlining of such 
procedures will help reduce delays and thus prevent 
possible curtailment of electricity.
4.2 Regulatory framework for renewable 
electricity generation
The implementation of the current regulatory 
framework for renewables presents several obstacles 
and challenges for private sector participation. 
Strengthening the confidence of private investors 
to invest in renewables would require the 
enhancement of relevant primary and secondary 
legislation (particularly, Law No. 2015-12, Decree No. 
2016-1123 and ministerial orders of 9 February 2017). 
Furthermore, based on past experiences - and given 
the inadequacy of information and lack of clarity on 
the regulatory environment and tendering process 
- stronger involvement of key stakeholders in the 
revision process of the regulatory framework would 
enable addressing some of the key concerns of private 
investors.
Under the Self-consumption scheme, developers 
are subject to complex administrative procedures, 
including the requirement for a preliminary validation 
of the installation request by STEG, the examination 
of the project by the technical commission CTER and 
the publication of the agreement signed by MIEM 
in Tunisia’s Official Journal. According to the 
renewable energy guides released in May 2019, 
validating requests for projects connected to the MV/
HV grid takes six months. The lengthy administrative 
procedures particularly discourage small-scale 
renewable energy project developers from advancing 
their projects. 
In addition, the current regulatory framework 
stipulates a complex metering and billing system 
for establishments connected to the MV grid, which 
are registered under the uniform tariff regime. This 
mode of energy metering excludes those consumers 
that do not match the required renewable energy 
production profile, including solar PV projects by local 
administrations for public lighting purposes. 
The tariffs for the sale of surplus electricity produced 
are currently set at low levels and have not been 
revised since 2014, despite multiple increases in 
electricity prices. This has constrained growth 
electricity production, pushing self-consumers to 
reduce their installed renewable capacity to levels in 
line with their own consumption needs, rather than 
selling excess production to STEG.
With respect to the Authorisation scheme, one 
of the main concerns for private developers is the 
absence of standardised contractual documents 
for bid submissions, thus resulting in discrepancies 
and lack of transparency, eventually reducing the 
bankability of PPAs. In general, the absence of any 
guarantee scheme regarding the off-taker risks limits 
the attractiveness of PPAs.
The results of the first call for projects of May 2017 
highlighted the constraints in project bankability, 
where most private sector offers were conditional 
upon the change in the structure of the PPA. KEY CHALLENGES AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Owing to this problem, no wind project has been 
selected at this round of call for projects.
Building on feedback received from the first round, 
MIEM reviewed the contract and made amendments to 
the PPA template. These changes, however, were not 
fully reflected on the ground – various stakeholders 
were unaware of the consultative process undertaken 
due to insufficient communication and information 
from the ministry to private stakeholders. 
The second round of calls for projects launched on
30 May 2018 for 70 MW of solar PV and 130 MW 
of wind energy also has reflected the absence of 
developer and lender confidence in the process and 
the overall renewable energy market. Additionally, 
private developers have often raised concerns 
pertaining to land acquisition. With the interest shown 
by these developers in regions with high potential for 
renewable energy and within proximity of the grid, 
the price of such land has increased considerably. 
These landholdings are generally agricultural, and 
several administrative procedures must be followed 
to obtain the authorisation to use them for renewable 
energy facilities.
This situation has prompted developers to search for 
state land; however, renewable energy Law No. 2015-12 
does not set clear criteria for the allocation of state land 
to private investors. To overcome this problem, MIEM is 
considering an alternative law that allows temporary 
occupation of state land by the private sector for a 
period not exceeding three years. 
Corporate PPAs under Law 2019-47 will hedge against 
rising electricity costs, thus presenting a trade-off for 
the national utility, STEG. Under the Concession scheme, 
the requirement to have the parliamentary approval 
of the concession agreements leads to delays in the 
implementation of the projects under this scheme.
A virtual platform should be created under the current 
Authorisation scheme and made accessible to all project 
developers. The platform would serve as the database 
for the contractual documents necessary for bid 
submissions. The public disclosure of these documents 
will strengthen procurement process transparency and 
provide clarity.
Projects under the Authorisation scheme also may 
encounter obstacles in the form of complex landacquisition agreements, thus dampening the appetite 
of project developers. A complete zoning analysis, 
therefore, would be advisable ahead of the next round 
of large-scale projects, with a view to identifying the 
most attractive, technically viable and economical 
locations for solar PV and wind energy investments 
(Recommendation S.4.1).
The project approval processes under the Concession 
scheme can also be simplified. An approval mechanism 
could be placed under the authority of MIEM to 
accelerate project implementation.
Standardise PPAs for renewable power 
procurement
The key design elements of current renewable energy 
PPAs are advised to be reviewed, along with the 
development of standardised PPAs. Other contractual 
project document templates for renewable energy 
projects also should be reviewed as per international 
best practice. 
With the inclusion of corporate PPAs, the key elements 
may be compared to that of utility-scale PPAs to 
better understand export criteria. IRENA finds that 
an auction process run by the system operator lowers 
possible bids for capacity and power, where the 
winning bidders would then be able to sign PPAs with 
corporate buyer of electricity (IRENA, 2018b). This 
may aid against expensive electricity tariffs. For the 
duration of the PPA, STEG may need to be engaged 
directly, as corporate PPAs diminish STEG revenues.
In this context, the Open Solar Contracts initiative can 
provide the necessary contractual templates that would 
be included in the bidding process for solar projects. This 
would include the PPA template (IRENA, 2018a) (Box 3).
Streamline administrative procedures 
With respect to the self-consumption scheme for 
small self-production projects connected to the MV 
grid with capacities not exceeding a certain threshold, 
the obligation for ministerial agreement is mandatory, 
while technical requests by STEG may be revisited. The 
procedure for net-metering should be simplified. In 
this regard, the government may consider adjustment 
and periodic review of the sales tariffs associated with 
surplus generation of self-producers
A complete zoning analysis, 
therefore, would be advisable 
before the next round of largescale projects, to identify the most 
viable locations for solar PV and 
wind energy investments.Box 4. Open Solar Contracts, Tunisia
The energy sector today has a legacy where 
power generation projects were predominantly 
large in scale and technically complex. Due to 
their highly intricate transaction structures, these 
projects require customised and complex legal and 
financial solutions, which have been inherited by 
renewables. This has resulted in high transaction 
costs and prolonged project development timelines, 
hindering further capacity growth, particularly in 
small- to medium-scale renewable energy projects. 
Redesigning prevailing market practices, therefore, 
need to become a priority in project development 
and finance, along with reforming the overly 
complicated contractual framework.
In response, the International Renewable Energy 
Agency (IRENA) and the Terrawatt Initiative have 
jointly launched a drive to simplify and streamline 
the contractual framework for solar power, so as 
to unlock greater investments globally. The Open 
Solar Contracts initiative, supported by multiple 
reputable law firms, will provide a standardised 
contractual documentation solution that will be 
freely and publicly available and is designed to be 
universally applicable. 
The initiative presents templates for six core 
contracts: 
1. Implementation agreement
2. Power purchase agreement
3. Supply agreement
4. Installation agreement
5. Operation and maintenance agreement
6. Finance term sheet
Work on the contracts was supported by the review 
of specific model clauses to address cross-cutting 
matters in a consistent manner and to reduce 
complexity. These include:
1. Governing law
2. Dispute resolution
3. Grid connection principles
4. Corruption and sanction
5. Force majeure
The resulting contract templates are intended to be 
used in conjunction with one another. This will ensure 
that the scope of work and the risks are appropriately 
allocated.
The initiative aims to decrease transaction costs, 
shorten project development timelines and establish 
a balanced risk allocation between public and private 
parties. The initiative also aims to simplify due diligence 
processes by financiers and to build the ground for 
project aggregation and securitisation. These would 
eventually support the rapid and widespread scale-up 
of solar power to the required level.
Contract templates have been finalised and are 
available to the global solar power community on 
www.opensolarcontracts.org. 
4.3 Institutional framework
Current procedures for the execution of renewable 
energy projects involve several ministries and public 
institutions. In addition to MIEM and STEG, institutions 
dealing with land, agriculture, finance planning 
and environment are involved, along with several 
commissions (e.g. CTER), ministries responsible for 
the control of protected areas and restricted zones, 
authorities issuing building permits, and those 
responsible for financial and fiscal incentives. The 
substantial number of actors involved in the process 
poses a challenge in the absence of a clear and 
transparent definition of the responsibilities of each 
institutionsometimes resulting in conflicting roles
Public institutions involved in renewable energy 
projects, including STEG and MIEM, face the challenge 
of insufficient human resources, thus hindering 
the fulfilment of their commitments vis-à-vis 
various processes during project development and 
implementation. The limitations in number and skills 
of staff are often a source of delay in the execution of 
procedures, especially under the Self-production and 
Authorisation schemes.
Furthermore, in the absence of an independent 
regulatory authority for the electricity sector, such 
regulatory function is currently performed by MIEM. 
The initiative aims to decrease 
transaction costs, shorten 
project development timelines 
and establish a balanced risk 
allocation between public and 
private parties.KEY CHALLENGES AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Law No. 2015-12 provides for the creation of a 
specialised authority responsible for the examination 
of possible disputes and appeals against decisions of 
the public administration. At present, however, the 
specialised authority functions as an advisory body to 
provide recommendations to MIEM, raising concerns 
over guaranteeing investors’ rights and ensuring 
transparency during the development, execution and 
operation of renewable energy projects.
Clarify institutional responsibilities and 
strengthen institutional capacity
With many ministries and public institutions involved 
Tunisia’s renewable power projects, the procedures for 
obtaining the required authorisations are complicated 
and time-consuming. To provide clarification on the 
roles of various public institutions, consideration 
should be given to creating an online platform and 
developing a guidebook. 
The platform would include details on the following:
• Roles and responsibilities of the various public 
institutions across the various stages of renewable 
energy project implementation.Administrative 
authorisations that should be obtained from each 
institution.
• Procedures necessary for obtaining such 
authorisations.
To ensure the effectiveness of the key public 
institutions involved in the development of renewable 
energy, local capabilities could be reinforced by:
• making adequate and qualified human resources 
available to relevant public institutions to perform 
assigned duties; and
• organising tailored capacity-building programmes 
for skill development across the renewable energy 
value chain, including the technical, economic, 
administrative and legal aspects of renewable 
energy to meet NDC targets.
Improve the renewable energy investment 
environment through establishment of an 
electricity regulatory authority
On the broader issue of electricity sector operation, 
creating an independent regulatory authority 
to oversee the electricity sector would enable 
a transparent and competitive environment for 
renewable energy developers. 
The regulatory authority would, among other actions:
• monitor effective implementation of the renewable 
energy-related legislation;
• validate technical conditions for evacuation and 
grid connection concerns; 
• ensure non-discriminatory access for private 
renewable energy producers to the grid;
• enforce compliance with the governing 
administrative framework for renewable energy 
project development and implementation; and
• settle conflicts among market actors relating to the 
interpretation or implementation of established 
legislation and procedures.
4.4 Financing
The FTE is the main financing tool for renewable 
energy and energy efficiency activities in Tunisia. 
The actions financed by this fund and the forms of 
its support have been broadened through Decree No. 
2017-983 of 26 July 2017. It allows the participation 
of this fund in renewable energy investments through 
financing and equity participation, in addition to the 
original function of grant support.
The practicality of these new schemes is not yet 
tested, and the participation of the FTE is still limited 
to grant contribution to renewable projects. The 
payment of such grant support by the ANME - in 
charge of managing the FTE - is currently processed 
with significant delay, causing serious financial 
problems for companies that are active in the fields of 
solar water heating and solar PV.
The expansion of FTE support will require the 
mobilisation of substantial additional resources. 
Current annual resources are in the order of
TND 40 million (about USD 14 million at July 2020 
exchange rates), while the new scope of support will 
require an annual budget of more than TND 100 million 
(USD 36 million) (ANME, 2015a). The law establishing 
the FTE envisages the possible imposition of taxes on 
consumed energy products to resource the FTE, but 
no provision has been made so far to this effect.
In addition, the incentives granted by the FTE cover a 
small proportion of the investment. Renewable energy 
promoters generally seek to close the financing of 
their projects through bank credits. Access to bank loans represents a major constraint 
for renewable energy developers, especially for small 
projects, since local banks are not accustomed to 
assuming renewable energy project-specific risks 
and generally require additional guarantees as a 
precondition for loan approval.
Operationalise the FTE
Most small-scale applications of solar water heaters 
and PV rooftop systems in the residential sector, 
developed under the Prosol and Prosol électrique 
programmes, have benefited from FTE support thanks 
to its dedicated financing structures. Development 
of clear and transparent procedures is needed to 
implement FTE provisions and define operational 
conditions and modalities, as well as to equip the 
fund with adequate resources to support renewable 
energy development at a larger scale. The structure 
of the fund may be revisited, for instance, to give it 
financial autonomy and help it act as an effective 
financial intermediary that makes credit lines and 
equity investment available to different projects.
Create a dedicated financing mechanism for 
solar water pumping
Water pumping is vital to the agriculture sector. A 
dedicated programme for solar water pumping set up 
by the government - or MIEM under FTE support - and 
supported by an appropriate financing mechanism 
could encourage farmers to use solar PV systems as 
a substitute for diesel generator sets. Such financing 
mechanism could rely on concessional lending 
schemes compatible with the repayment capacity of 
farmers.
Encourage the involvement of local banks in 
renewable energy financing
The development of renewable energy solutions, 
especially for farmers and small- and medium-size 
enterprises (SME), requires a stronger involvement 
of local banks in the financing of renewable energy 
projects. The technical dimension of local banks 
may need to be reinforced to develop capacity for 
renewable energy projects. Appropriate partnership/
co-financing mechanisms should be explored with 
international financing institutions and bilateral funding 
partners, including climate funding instruments and 
programmes, to meet the country’s NDC commitments. 
In turn, allowing local banks to serve as a financial 
intermediary to receive resources from international 
banks may address risk concerns surrounding lending 
proceduresIn this casesetting up credit lines through 
intermediary financial institutions tends to attract 
investments to the sector. This increase will lead to 
Tunisia’s Central Bank’s endorsement of national loan 
guarantee schemes. In this context, the scope of the 
Tunisian Guarantee Company (Société Tunisienne de 
Garantie) mechanism could be expanded to include 
renewable energy projects. 
Dedicated capacity building programmes can be 
developed to target the local financial sector and 
to incentivise project developers to improve the 
knowledge of, and enable easier access to, the 
available financial tools. This will help reduce and 
better address the risks, as well as enhance investment 
conditions relating to renewable energy projects. 
4.5 Maximising the benefits of 
renewable energy deployment
Deployment of renewable energy presents considerable 
socioeconomic benefits and opportunities for local 
value creation along the various segments of the value 
chain. This includes the sourcing of raw materials, 
manufacture and assembly of components, construction 
and installation, and operation and maintenance. 
IRENA’s assessment of Tunisia’s renewable energy 
manufacturing potential found that there is unfulfilled 
potential to leverage local value creation along the 
entire value chain of large-scale solar and wind 
projects. For example, certain electrical and mechanical 
components of wind turbines can be produced locally 
that could account for more than 70% of wind turbine 
costs (EIB and IRENA, 2015).
Tunisia has well-qualified staff for research and 
development activities, such that intellectual property 
rights are well protected, and the quality of its 
research institutes is acknowledged. Despite these 
assets, upgrading programmes are necessary for local 
companies to move from low-value to relatively highvalue activities (EIB and IRENA, 2015). 
Implement upgrading programmes targeting 
specific industrial actors
Industrial upgrade programmes can serve as strong 
assets in the effort to strengthen the capabilities 
of local firms. These programmes would aim to 
enhance the technological capabilities of SMEs by 
enabling them to capture value from renewable 
energy investments and to facilitate closer linkages 
with business partners. Therefore, with the support 
of public authorities and other local stakeholders, 
developing industrial and service-sector policies can 
help promote the solar and wind value chainsKEY CHALLENGES AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Box 5. Leveraging local capacity
and the materials required for 
 renewable energy technologies
Renewable energy development can drive economic 
growth, create new jobs and enhance human health 
and welfare. To design effective policies in support 
of value creation, however, policy makers need a 
thorough understanding of the materials and labour 
requirements.
The Leveraging Local Capacity report series (IRENA, 
2017a; 2017b; 2018c) examines these requirements 
in the solar photovoltaic (PV) and onshore and 
offshore wind industries.
The figure below shows the main materials needed 
for plants in these industries, and thus indicates the 
sort of industries most relevant to renewable energy 
deployment. 
Leveraging this capacity can provide expertise, 
raw materials and intermediary products for the 
manufacture of PV components, such as cells and 
modules, inverters, trackers, mounting structures 
and electrical equipment.
For a typical 50 megawatt (MW) onshore 
wind facility, almost 23 000 tonnes of concrete 
are necessary for the foundations, and nearly 
6 000 tonnes of steel and iron for the turbines and 
foundations. For offshore wind, the requirements 
are similar. Manufacturing the main components of 
a wind turbine requires specialist equipment, as well 
as welding, lifting, and painting machines that are 
used in other industries, such as construction and 
aeronautics. 
Examining these requirements provides insights 
into industrial capabilities that can be leveraged. 
The figure below indicates the materials required 
for a 1 MW solar PV plant, a 50 MW onshore wind 
plant, and a 500 MW offshore wind plan.

of human resources and 
occupational requirements
The Leveraging Local Capacity report series of the 
International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA, 
2017a; 2017b; 2018c) generates valuable information 
for policy makers on the occupational and skill structure 
along the value chain. The figure below illustrates the 
labour force requirement for solar photovoltaic plants 
and onshore and offshore wind farms.
To develop a typical 50 MW solar photovoltaic
project, a total of approximately 230 000 persondays is required from project planning to 
manufacturing, installing and operation and 
maintenance (O&M), as well as decommissioning. 
The highest labour force requirements are in O&M 
(56%), followed by procurement and manufacturing 
(22%) and construction and installation (17%). 
In the procurement and manufacturing segment, 
factory workers and technicians represent 64% of 
the labour need, followed by engineers (12%). In the 
O&M segment, construction workers account for 
48% of the labour force requirements, followed by 
safety experts (19%) and engineers (15%).
Similarly, for the development of a 50 MW onshore 
wind project, a total of 144 000 person-days is 
needed. Human resource requirements are highest 
in O&M (43% of total), followed by construction and 
installation (30%) and manufacturing (17%).
For offshore wind, the majority of human resources 
(totalling 2.1 million person-days for a 500 MW farm) 
lies in the manufacturing and procurement segment. 
Existing manufacturing facilities for onshore wind 
can serve the needs of the offshore sector, as many 
components are comparable. Significant synergies 
also exist between the offshore oil and gas industry 
and the offshore wind sector.

Educate and train skilled workforce
Investment in the education and training of engineers 
and other high-skilled workers is considered a key 
building block for expanding local institutional capacity 
in renewable technologies. Agencies and associations 
already active in such initiatives include (i) the 
Cairo-based Regional Center for Renewable Energy 
and Energy Efficiency (RCREEE); (ii) the regional 
RE-ACTIVATE project of the Germany International 
Cooperation Agency (GIZ – Deutsche Gesellschaft für 
Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH); (iii) ANME; 
(iv) the National Centre for Continuing Vocational 
Training and Professional Promotion (Centre 
National de Formation Continue et de Promotion 
Professionnelle); and (v) the Research and Technology 
Centre for Energy Technologies (Centre de Recherches 
et des Technologies de l’energie). Such stakeholders 
have been development and dissemination of energy 
policies, research activities and training on low- and 
medium-power renewable applications (e.g. rooftop 
PV, solar water heaters, water pumping). 
Similar efforts could address the training needs of 
large-scale projects. The role played by international 
institutions on educational policies through the 
inclusion of renewables in educational programmes 
and strategic planning to meet the required skills 
needs, therefore, will be essential to instil a skilled 
workforceREFERENCES

Sector coupling and the electrification
of end-use sectors
The current energy diversification strategy in Tunisia 
has set a target to meet 30% of its electricity generation 
from renewables. To achieve such ambitious targets, 
several enabling initiatives have been established. As 
solar and wind power gain momentum, they will occupy 
a larger share of power generation. To accommodate 
such a large share of electricity, therefore, a stable and 
flexible grid is essential to maintain reliability and avoid 
production being curtailed. In the Tunisian context, the 
current grid is unable to accommodate the ambitious 
2030 targets, and additional grid reinforcement 
measures should be taken. 
Grid reinforcement measures require significant 
investment. The report, Renewable Energy Policies in 
a Time of Transition, by the International Renewable 
Energy Agency, International Energy Agency and 
REN21 (2018) concluded that policy makers in charge 
of energy sector planning must explore different 
cost-efficient methods to address curtailment. In 
turn, cost-efficient sector coupling may better align 
electricity demand with variable renewable energy 
(VRE) production profiles. This is achievable if 
proper strategies for shaping the demand profile are 
adopted. Several options are available, including the 
electrification of heating and cooling, stationary 
long- and short-term energy storage, and key sectorcoupling applications, such as electric vehicles (EVs) 
(Figure A2.1). 
Global sales of electric vehicles (EV) hit a record high in 
2016. Despite being in the early phases of deployment, 
the International Renewable Energy Agency has found 
that EVs have significant potential, its analysis indicating 
that there likely will be 157 million vehicles in 2030. EVs 
can assist in providing valuable system services, thus 
increasing the value of VRE by ensuring that energy is 
consumed at times of high VRE production. 
In addition, electricity can replace fossil fuels in industry 
and help reduce its energy-related – and, in some cases, 
process-related – greenhouse gas emissions, while 
providing enhanced flexibility to the system. Additional 
sector coupling can be achieved by using renewables 
to produce hydrogen or hydrogen-rich chemicals to 
serve as feedstock, process agents or fuels. Power-togas or power-to-liquids (commonly named Power-to-X 
(P2X)) technologies combine hydrogen with carbon 
or nitrogen to produce fuels for end-use sectors. 
Producing storable energy carriers, such as hydrogen 
or synthetic fuels, can increase the long-term value of 
VRE.
For Tunisia to meet its renewable energy targets, it 
needs to establish direct policies for the various enduse sectors within the overall energy planning process. 
As presented in Figure A2.1, several opportunities are 
available, including the electrification of the heating 
and cooling sectors, the transport sector and industrial 
processes, coupled with the use of synthetic fuels. 
These provide ample opportunities to address flexibility 
concerns and increase renewable energy deployment 
(IRENA, IEA and REN21, 2018).
