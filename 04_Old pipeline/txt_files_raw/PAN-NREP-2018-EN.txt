ASSESSMENT
PANAMAHydropower is the main source of renewable energy in Panama, based on capacity first put in 
place by a vertically integrated state-owned utility. In the last 20 years, we have developed a 
market characterised by competition, whose actors have invested more than 6 billion balboas to 
move the power sector forward. The results have been satisfactory, and the electric power supply 
adequately supports our growing economy.
In recent years, our energy matrix has been reinforced by the deployment of other, newer 
renewable energy technologies. Since 2014, investments in solar and wind energy have grown 
markedly.
Today, more than two-thirds of Panama’s electricity generation comes from clean sources, 
primarily through the contribution of hydropower. The country also has the largest wind farm in 
the region, and solar power generation – although still modest – has begun to take off rapidly. A 
key factor behind this trend has been the decrease in the prices of such technologies. The rise of 
solar and wind power challenges us to ensure adequate sector-wide planning, particularly so that 
they can compete on even terms with conventional technologies.
Given this scenario, there is no doubt about the way forward for Panama’s energy system. The 
country is dedicated to fulfilling the commitments made in the Paris Agreement and aims to play 
a meaningful part in the global fight against climate change.
FOREWORD
from the
Secretary of EnergyPanama, therefore, has enthusiastically joined with the International Renewable Energy Agency 
(IRENA) in the preparation of this Renewable Readiness Assessment, which can help us to 
determine the adjustments needed to effectively incorporate these technologies.
The objective is to keep up the pace of development in the power sector in a competitive and 
transparent environment. This includes scaling up private investment, under sound policies, 
without subsidies, and avoiding any action that causes distortion in the market price.
Panama has been an active participant in IRENA’s work from the beginning. This is because we 
are convinced that such international co-operation can help to point the way for future energy 
development.
We thank all of our national and international collaborators for their support in the preparation 
and revision of this document, which we are sure will benefit the entire region.
Victor Carlos Urrutia
National Secretary of Energy 
Republic of PanamaLike many countries in Central America, Panama faces the challenges of a growing population 
and rising energy demand to power its economic growth. Oil and oil products account for around 
two-thirds of primary energy supply, making Panama vulnerable to global price volatility and 
rising costs for fuel imports. At the same time, the growing impact of climate change has led to 
droughts and disrupted the country’s hydropower resources. 
To address these challenges, Panama’s National Energy Plan 2015-2050 has started moving the 
energy sector decisively towards a more diverse energy mix that takes full advantage of the 
country’s significant renewable energy resource potential. At the core of the plan is a massive 
scale-up of solar photovoltaic and wind energy. These sources, combined with hydropower, 
would account for 77% of installed power capacity by 2050. 
Furthermore, with the ambitious goal of supplying 70% of the national energy mix through 
renewables by 2050, the plan serves as a long-term roadmap for the transition to a sustainable 
energy future. 
This Renewables Readiness Assessment (RRA), undertaken by the International Renewable 
Energy Agency (IRENA) in close co-operation with the Government of Panama, examines 
the energy sector holistically. The study identifies key actions to expand renewable energy 
development in the short to medium-term. 
FOREWORD
from the IRENA
Director-GeneralPanama is also the pilot country for IRENA’s Clean Energy Corridor of Central America
(CECCA) initiative, which supports the accelerated deployment of renewable power at the 
regional level. For this reason, the RRA examines Panama’s power-system planning and 
operational procedures, along with the existing regulatory and financial incentives to develop 
variable renewable energy for the national and regional electricity market. 
Since 2011, the RRA process has been undertaken in over 30 countries across Africa, the Caribbean, 
Latin America, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region. This has led to increased knowledge 
exchange and support for international co-operation to promote clean, indigenous renewable 
energy technologies. 
I wish to thank the Energy Secretary, Dr. Urrutia, and his staff at the National Energy Secretariat 
of Panama for their support in the preparation of this study. Insights from other governmental 
agencies and a wide range of other stakeholders have further enriched the findings. IRENA 
looks forward to working with all of them, as well as with regional institutions and development 
partners, to translate these recommendations into practical on-the-ground initiatives that 
promote renewables as a key element in sustainable, equitable socio-economic development.
I sincerely hope the RRA process and its recommendations will strengthen Panama’s pursuit 
of renewable energy solutions. IRENA stands ready to assist in the country’s transition to a 
sustainable energy future.

VRE Variable Renewable Energy The Penonomé I and II wind projects located on 
Panama’s southern coastEXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Panama depends heavily on fossil fuels, which have historically accounted for roughly 
two-thirds of total primary energy supply. The country’s transport sector has until 
recently relied almost entirely on oil and oil products. At the same time, electricity 
demand in the country has continued to increase, reaching a peak demand of over 
1 600 megawatts (MW) in 2015. 
To meet this growth, Panama introduced wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) energy in 
2013, which reached 270 MW and 90 MW of installed capacity by 2016, respectively. 
However, fossil-fuelled generation from coal, oil and oil products still accounted for 
nearly one-third of power production in 2016, and plans are in place to bring natural 
gas-fired capacity on line in the years ahead. These developments make Panama’s 
transition to a sustainable energy future uncertain.
However, in March 2016, the Government of Panama approved the National Energy 
Plan 2015-2050 (PEN 2015-2050) to serve as a long-term roadmap for diversifying 
the energy sector and advancing energy access, energy efficiency, energy security 
and the overall decarbonisation of the energy system. The plan compares a “businessas-usual” reference-case scenario with an alternative, ambitious scenario, and finds 
that under the reference-case scenario, Panama’s demand growth trajectory would 
lead to a higher share of coal in the power mix by 2050. The ambitious scenario, in 
contrast, suggests that renewable energy could reach 70% of the power supply in the 
next 35 years, while at the same time meeting growth in demand. Furthermore, under 
the ambitious scenario, a solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy scale-up, combined 
with hydropower, would account for 77% of installed power capacity by 2050.
Reaching this desired energy future would require exploitation of Panama’s vast 
renewable energy potential, which includes resources such as hydropower, wind, 
solar, geothermal, marine and biomass (bagasse, husk, firewood, charcoal, peat and 
bioethanol). Despite abundant renewable energy resources, solar and wind companies 
in Panama face economic challenges, given that the current power market model is 
based on conventional sources such as thermal and hydropower generation and does 
not recognise the unique operating characteristics of variable renewable energy (VRE) 
generation. As such, adjustments to electricity sector regulation are needed to ensure 
that variable renewables compete on a level playing field with conventional generation 
sources. 
The high shares of solar and wind in the electricity network, as envisaged in the 
PEN 2015-2050, will require significant flexibility mechanisms in the power system. 
Combined with updated power system planning and operational practices, these 
measures can help ensure the reliable integration of VRE in a cost-effective manner.
This Renewables Readiness Assessment (RRA) finds that several key challenges would 
need to be effectively addressed to further exploit indigenous renewable energy 
resources and integrate growing shares of solar and wind energy in Panama’s power 
system. To this end, the recommendations that follow are provided to the Government 
of Panama for its consideration in the development of policy and regulation for its RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
1. Assess the regulatory and financial 
incentives for VRE development
Panama’s power market has been structured 
around the operation of its hydropower and thermal 
generation fleet, where generators are rewarded 
on the basis of an outdated definition of firm 
power. To allow renewables to compete on a level 
playing field vis-à-vis conventional generation, 
particularly in the competitive wholesale market, 
the current regulatory framework conditions must 
be adjusted to adequately capture the unique 
operating characteristics of VRE, and in doing so, 
incentivise new development of wind and solar PV. 
By undertaking a robust assessment of the 
investment incentives for wind and solar PV 
projects, both under the current and expected 
market conditions, Panama can identify factors 
with a negative influence on investment behaviour 
and their required regulatory responses. Given 
the importance of power purchase agreements 
(PPAs) for solar and wind energy, the assessment 
should take into account possible adjustments to 
the compensation for curtailment of renewable 
generators, a new calculation of PPA-related 
remuneration levels and an updated definition of 
firm power that incorporates variable renewable 
generation output. The assessment should 
culminate in a set of implementable solutions 
that can help lead to a strengthened investment 
environment without compromising the efficient 
functioning of the Panamanian electricity market.
2. Develop a national strategy to improve 
power system planning and modelling with 
higher penetrations of VRE
Looking ahead, power system planning will 
continue to be a critical element of Panama’s 
evolving energy sector, as planners must cope 
with rising variability from the envisaged high 
penetration of solar and wind generation through 
to 2050. Without strong sets of quantitative 
techno-economic analyses to guide such planning, 
however, generation expansion can be delayed, grid 
infrastructure development costs can be allocated 
inefficiently, and the overall reliable operation of 
the power system can be compromised. 
In response to these challenges, Panama should 
develop a comprehensive plan to define long-term 
transition scenarios and near-term actions. This 
will help align the development of the electricity 
grid with the development of new VRE generation. 
Moreover, it can help rationalise the management 
of connection queues, reduce or avoid interrupting 
renewables generation, support the efficient 
use of the SIEPAC (Central American Electrical 
Interconnection System) regional line, and cut 
overall costs of the electricity system.
3. Identify new operational practices to 
increase the flexibility and reliability of a 
grid with growing shares of VRE
Panama’s power system operations still largely 
reflect an “old paradigm” of centralised, 
dispatchable generation units. Yet, due to 
the unique physical conditions of variable 
renewables, reliably integrating solar and wind 
sources into the electricity network requires 
modifications to the National Dispatch Centre 
(CND) operational procedures, in addition to 
increased flexibility measures. These include 
enhanced forecasting techniques, improved 
ancillary services, more flexible scheduling of 
generation and load dispatch practices, and 
improved management of reserves, among 
other areas. 
A comprehensive evaluation of new operational 
practices would further identify the necessary 
flexibility options for the reliable operation of the 
power system with a higher penetration of solar 
and wind. 
The International Renewable Energy Agency 
(IRENA), through its work with CND under 
the Clean Energy Corridor of Central America 
(CECCA) initiative,1
 identified additional potential 
updates related to power system operations in 
Panama. These include: automation of system 
security analysis using power system software 
to allow closer real-time system security checks, 
with the aim of reducing VRE curtailment due to 
network congestion; calculation of transmission 
capacities closer to real time and considering 
forecasts for wind and solar production in these 
calculations to minimise curtailment; and training 
on the impacts of VRE on transient and frequency 
stability analyses.
4. Assess the regulatory interfaces between 
the National Electricity Market (MEN) and 
Regional Electricity Market (MER)
With its connection to the SIEPAC, Panama 
participates in the MER with five other countries 
in Central America. However, due to a lack of harmonisation among rules and methodologies, 
such as grid codes, the MER does not function 
in a fully efficient manner and is underutilised. 
Moreover, institutional gaps exist between single 
jurisdictions and the regional market. In this 
respect, more flexible market rules, including the 
allocation of transmission rights, are needed to 
ensure firmness through the multiple resources of 
the MER, instead of the current approach which 
allows limited short-term transactions. 
By undertaking an assessment of the regulatory 
interfaces between the MEN and the MER, Panama 
can advise on potential solutions to current 
challenges, such as energy transfer problems on 
the MER, grid design values, and the suboptimal 
regional dispatch that occurs when energy is 
“trapped” on national markets due to transmission 
constraints. 
Key issues that need to be further analysed include: 
the definition of firm energy and its equivalence to 
firm capacity at national level; the authorisation 
of the right of transmission and of the long-term 
firm contract; the creation of an intraday market 
to adjust the volumes of variable renewables; 
the concept of interruptible service under firm 
contracts at the national level; and verification of 
the capacity limits of the SIEPAC line, as designed.
5. Examine the skills development needs of 
Panama’s workforce to support efforts 
towards reaching the 2050 renewable 
energy goal
In order to achieve a 70% renewable energy 
share in Panama’s power supply by the year 
2050, as envisaged in the PEN 2015-2050, a 
robust workforce will be essential to underpin the 
growing solar PV and wind energy market in the 
country. An examination of the current national 
workforce in the field of renewables and the 
projected future needs can help to adjust existing 
and new education and training programmes to 
develop the necessary renewables workforce. 
To comprehensively evaluate workforce needs, the 
assessment should, at a minimum, include a survey 
of: current education and training for renewables 
in Panama; the range of jobs available in Panama’s 
renewable energy sector; and the types of 
renewable energy training and certifications that 
employers prefer. This would then lead to the 
development of new or expanded education and 
training programmes in line with the goals of the 
PEN 2015-2050. 
6. Develop a long-term plan for electric 
mobility and sector-coupling
Panama’s transport sector has traditionally relied 
entirely on fossil fuels; however, with the growth of 
the Panama Metro, the electrification of transport 
in the country has begun. To adapt Panama’s 
energy system to this evolving paradigm, a 
comprehensive plan is needed that considers a 
sector-coupling approach between power and 
transport, and considers the introduction of 
expanded metro lines, electric passenger vehicles 
and electric buses. 
Developing a comprehensive Urban Mobility 
Plan for Panama based on the electrification 
of transport would help speed up the use of 
renewable energy in the electricity mix, reduce the 
transport problems that currently affect Panama 
(such as high levels of congestion, urban planning, 
limited availability of public transport), support 
the reduction of CO2 emissions, and eliminate the 
current dependence of the sector on fossil fuels.
At the same time, the generalised subsidy of 
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking acts 
as a disincentive to deployment of electric stoves 
and thus the shift in residential and commercial 
energy demand from the fossil-fuel sector to the 
electricity sector. Shifting this demand profile 
would provide an opportunity to meet increased 
demand in the end-use sectors with solar and 
wind generation, aligning with the goals of the 
PEN 2015-2050 alternative scenario. 
Therefore, in the residential and commercial sectors, 
policy options should be examined that can alter or 
eliminate subsidies for LPG. This process should 
compare the true costs of cooking with LPG and 
using electric cook stoves that are deployed in 
concert with high shares of renewable power. Panama City skylineI. INTRODUCTION
1.1 COUNTRY BACKGROUND
Panama is the southernmost country in Central America. As the link between Central 
and South America, it borders Colombia to the east and Costa Rica to the west. To 
its north is the Caribbean Sea, and to its south the Pacific Ocean. 
Panama has a surface area of 75 320 square kilometres (km2
), and its population sits 
at just over 4 million (2017). The capital, Panama City, is located in the centre of the 
country and is home to roughly 1.6 million people (UN, 2017).
 
Panama’s economy operates without a central bank, and uses the US dollar as legal 
tender. Its official currency, the balboa, is tied to the US dollar: one dollar equals 
one balboa. Since the 1990s, when the Panamanian economy was liberalised, the 
country’s banking sector has become one of the most globalised in Latin America. 
Gross domestic product (GDP) growth in Panama has been stable in recent years 
(Figure 1). In 2016, the country’s GDP reached USD 55 billion, and it is forecast to 
grow at around 5.4% in 2018 (World Bank, 2017a).

USD billion (current)Following the official request of the Government 
of Panama to IRENA, the RRA process was 
initiated. It has been led by Panama’s National 
Energy Secretariat (SNE), with IRENA facilitating 
the process. The RRA has been undertaken in 
conjunction with the national-level projects of 
IRENA’s Clean Energy Corridor of Central America 
(CECCA) initiative, given that Panama was later 
chosen as the pilot country of the initiative in 2016.2
The completed RRA process for Panama includes a 
background paper, an identification of stakeholders 
and strategic partners, a set of service-resource 
pairs, an RRA Expert Workshop and a Validation 
Workshop. 
In October 2016, the government hosted an RRA 
Technical Consultation Workshop in Panama where 
national, regional and international stakeholders 
exchanged and validated the findings of the RRA 
Background Paper. Discussions focused on the 
overall status of renewable energy development in 
Panama, and identified key barriers to accelerating 
deployment.
Based on this, priority actions were then developed 
to form a set of recommendations. The group 
discussions were divided into four areas:
• National Energy Plan 2015-2050: Institutional, 
policy and regulatory frameworks, and their 
national and regional implications.
• Renewable energy targets: Assessing renewable 
energy resources for stronger planning.
• National and regional market interaction, and 
private-sector renewable energy financing. 
• Large-scale and small-scale distributed 
renewable energy integration.
The workshops shaped the focus of the RRA. For 
instance, the electricity sector was identified early on 
as a key focus area, since immediate adaptations to 
power system operations can help integrate higher 
shares of variable renewable energy (VRE), such as 
wind and solar. This also has important implications 
for Panama’s end-use sectors, as the growing 
power demand resulting from the electrification of 
transport and residential appliances could be met 
by scaling up variable renewables in the power mix.
The Validation Workshop, co organised by SNE and 
IRENA, was held in June 2017. The recommendations 
in Section 4 of this report were discussed and 
validated by the government and all relevant 
stakeholders.
Between 2007 and 2013, the service sector 
accounted for the largest share of the country’s 
total GDP, at 74% (World Bank, 2017a). This is 
largely due to the Panama Canal, a 77 kilometre 
(km) artificial waterway that cuts across the country 
and connects the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific 
Ocean. Completed in 1914 and expanded in 2014, 
the canal underpins Panama’s trade, transport and 
tourism industries (SNE, 2015).
Climate change is a concern for Panama, which has 
a tropical climate and both a rainy and dry season. 
The country experiences various extreme weather 
events, such as El Niño-La Niña events, floods, 
droughts, tropical cyclones and windstorms, among 
others (Adaptation Fund, 2017). Further climate 
risks for Panama relate to rising sea levels, altered 
agriculture and food production, and changes to its 
ecosystems and biodiversity. 
To help mitigate these impacts, Panama’s Ministry 
of Environment developed the “Estrategia Nacional 
de Cambio Climático de Panamá” (National Climate 
Change Strategy of Panama), which outlines 
actions and strategies for adaptation and crosssectoral greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction 
(Ministry of Environment, 2015).
Central to the country’s action on climate is the 
decarbonisation of its energy system, with the 
National Energy Plan 2015-2050 (PEN 2015-2050) 
aiming to reduce energy sector emissions by 60.6% 
by 2050, compared to a reference case scenario 
(SNE, 2015). These efforts are also reflected in 
the country’s Nationally Determined Contribution 
(NDC), which sets a goal of a 15% increase in nonhydropower renewable energy capacity by 2030, 
and 30% by 2050,1
 compared to base year 2014 
(Government of Panama, 2016). 
1.2 RENEWABLES READINESS 
ASSESSMENT IN PANAMA
The International Renewable Energy Agency 
(IRENA) developed the Renewables Readiness 
Assessment (RRA) as a tool to carry out a 
comprehensive evaluation of the conditions for 
renewable energy deployment in specific countries. 
The RRA is a country-led, consultative process 
that leverages broad, multi-stakeholder dialogue 
to identify barriers and solutions to renewables 
deployment in a country.

2.1 ENERGY SUPPLY AND DEMAND
Panama’s total primary energy supply has historically had a high dependence on oil 
and oil products. Figure 2 shows the evolution of the country’s primary energy sources, 
with oil generally accounting for over 60%, and reaching nearly 80% at certain points.

Oil and oil products Hydropower Solar Bagasse Coal Wind WoodPanama’s energy demand can be divided into 
four main sectors: residential; commercial and 
public; industrial; and transport. Figure 3 shows 
the evolution of total final energy consumption in 
each of these sectors. The transport sector is the 
largest energy consumer, followed by the industrial 
sector. The transport and industrial sectors are 
the main consumers of oil and oil products, while 
the commercial and public and residential sectors 
account for the highest electricity share.
The share of electricity in total energy supply has 
remained at around 20% for the last 15 years (Figure 
4), while the final electricity consumption rate has 
witnessed a steep growth rate of approximately 
5.8% annually.

Transport Industrial Residential Commercial and public
As stated above, the commercial and public sector 
is the main consumer of electricity, followed by the 
residential sector and industrial sector. Given its 
high dependence upon oil products, the transport 
sector consumes the least electricity among 
sectors (Figure 5). The following paragraphs 
provide further detail on the energy profile of each 
end-use sector. 
Based on SNE (2015), Plan Energético Nacional (2015-2050).
Figure 4: Total final electricity consumption and electricity share in the total 
 energy supply (1998-2014)
Figure 5: Electricity consumption share by sector (2014)1. RESIDENTIAL SECTOR:
Household energy requirements are supplied 
by electricity, wood and liquefied petroleum gas 
(LPG) for cooking and heating. As Figure 6 shows, 
electricity consumption has expanded rapidly in 
households, particularly over the last 10 years, 
which has in turn boosted total final electricity 
consumption (Figure 4). The residential sector 
also relies on wood for cooking and heating, an 
estimated 13% of Panamanian households using 
wood (SNE, 2015). 
LPG also maintains a high share of the energy used 
in the sector, and correlates with growth in total 
energy consumption. The 25-pound LPG tank has 
been subsidised since 1992, following an executive 
decision by the government, and this decision was 
later endorsed by a sequence of Cabinet decrees. 
In 2009, an official decree for price regulation of 
LPG used in households was created (Ministry of 
Industries and Commerce, 2009), and by 2014, 
annual LPG subsidies in Panama had reached 
USD 96 million (SNE, 2015). 
The PEN 2015-2050 recognises the need to 
increase the use of electric cooking stoves in 
Panamanian households, which could support 
government efforts to increase electricity access 
while at the same time reducing the use of LPG 
and wood for cooking and heating.

The transport sector includes both cargo and 
passenger transport, and is the largest consumer 
in Panama’s total final energy consumption, at 
around 45% (Figure 3). The number of vehicles on 
the road in Panama has accelerated in recent years, 
from 564 155 in 2012 to 718 518 in 2015 (Figure 7). 
Between 2012 and 2014, gasoline in Panama was 
blended with 5% ethanol, until the mixing plant 
ceased operations due to economic challenges. 
However, this blending initiative is expected to 
return. While still a nascent market, hybrid vehicles 
have begun to increase their sales in the country, 
while electric vehicles have yet to be deployed on 
a large scale in Panama.
The PEN 2015-2050 will 
require significant flexibility 
mechanisms in the power system
An increase in the use of electrified public transport 
has begun to take place following the creation of 
Line 1 of Metro de Panamá (the Panama Metro), 
which provides a range of benefits to the population 
including reduced journey times. In the year to 
February 2018, the metro system was already 
carrying between 5 and 7 million riders each month, 
having started operations in 2014 (The Panama 
Metro, 2018).
A second line is currently under construction, with 
a third line under development and an eventual 
fourth and fifth line being planned. The growing use 
of electrified transport (public and private) could 
represent a moderate increase in electricity demand, 
which could in turn be used as an opportunity to 
expand the use of renewable power generation to 
meet this new demand (sector coupling).

with the Panama Metro, has developed the 
Comprehensive Plan for Sustainable Urban 
Mobility (PIMUS) for the transport sector. The plan 
is intended to serve as a framework for sustainable 
mobility policy in the Metropolitan Area of 
Panama, with an emphasis on capitalising on the 
investment in the expansion of the metro system. 
In addition, it identifies the best international 
practices for the reduction of GHG emissions in 
urban mobility (CCAP, 2016).
The plan suggests five key action areas: 
1. Strengthening institutional capacity.
2. Establishing an integrated public transport 
system.
3. Mitigating the impact of the use of the 
private vehicle.
4. Generating an investment programme in 
road infrastructure for mobility.
5. Promoting citizen participation in the 
management of mobility.
3. INDUSTRIAL SECTOR:
Industry has seen moderate growth in energy 
demand, with total energy consumption in the 
sector reaching nearly 7 000 kboe in 2014, from 
5 209 kboe in 2010 (Figure 8). Buildings in Panama 
use electricity for lighting, cooling, heating and 
motive power, while bunker fuel and diesel are 
used in boilers and furnaces to produce heat, and 
petroleum coke is used in cement plants. The use 
of oil products corresponds to more than 80% of 
the industrial sector’s total energy consumption 
(Figure 8). Energy-intensive industries in Panama 
include food, tobacco, cement and paper 
production.

The commercial and public sector is the largest 
consumer of electricity among the four sectors. 
Consumption reached 2 816 kboe in 2014 (Figure 
5). Since 2010, the sector has accounted for about 
15% of total final energy consumption in Panama, 
and its electricity consumption has maintained an 
annual average growth rate of 6.2% (Figure 9).
As services are the primary activity in this sector, it 
can be expected that information technology will 
play an important role in efficiency measures and 
energy savings in the future.

Total electricity consumpon (kboe)2.2 KEY INSTITUTIONS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR
The government institutions involved in energy 
policy and regulation include the following:
1. The National Energy Secretariat (SNE) oversees 
the development and implementation of national 
energy policy to promote a diversified energy 
supply, with an aim to reduce costs and avoid 
adverse social and environmental impacts. SNE 
is also responsible for promoting a competitive 
energy market, as well as a regulatory framework 
that facilitates a modern and efficient electricity 
system. In addition, SNE may propose changes to 
laws, including policy support mechanisms. 
2. The National Authority of Public Services (ASEP) 
is the regulator of the National Electricity Market 
(MEN). It monitors compliance with market rules, 
issues regulations, facilitates dispute resolution 
between market actors, and grants licences and 
concessions for new market agents.
3. The Ministry of Environment was created in 
2015 and is charged with formulating national 
environmental policy and promoting the 
sustainable use of natural resources. It is also 
responsible for approving the Environmental 
Impact Assessment of energy projects and 
granting use of a natural resources. 
4.The National Science and Technology Secretariat 
is an autonomous agency that promotes 
sustainable development in Panama through 
science and technology, and works with the 
public and private sectors, as well as academia. In 
this context, the secretariat supports renewable 
energy and sustainable development forums in 
Panama. 
In 1997, the state-owned, vertically integrated 
electricity company, Hydraulic Resources and 
Electrification Institute, was unbundled into 
separate business units. Following this process, four 
generation units, one transmission unit and three 
distribution units were created. The generation and 
distribution units were partially privatised, with the 
government still maintaining minority ownership 
in them, while the transmission unit remained 
completely state-owned. 
Since then, the power generation market in Panama 
has steadily grown through mostly private capital, 
while some power plants still belong to the public 
sector or have taken the form of public-private 
partnerships (Annex I). In 2006, the state-owned 
Electricity Generation Company (EGESA) was 
created by the government to develop projects and 
compete in the generation market with the private 
sector. 
Panama also has self-generators, which are defined 
as companies that generate their own electricity 
and can sell the surplus and buy any deficiency on 
the national or regional market. A co-generator is 
defined as a company that generates electricity 
as a by-product of its main activity and can sell 
its surplus and buy its deficiency on the national 
or regional market. An example is a sugar mill 
that produces high-pressure steam by burning 
the bagasse in a boiler. This steam moves the 
turbines for the various equipment of the sugar 
manufacturing process, while also being used to 
generate electricity for the mill, with surplus energy 
sold on the market. Panama’s transmission and distribution 
infrastructure is managed by several key actors, 
including:
1. The Electricity Transmission Company, ETESA, 
maintains responsibility for developing and 
operating the transmission system, providing 
feasibility of connection to new actors and 
conducting energy and power tendering in 
accordance with the policies and procedures 
established by the SNE and ASEP. It also 
arranges auctions on behalf of Panama’s 
distribution companies, and concludes power 
purchase agreements (PPAs) with distributors 
and generating actors. 
2. The Metro-West Distribution Company, EDEMET, 
the Chiriquí Distribution Company, EDECHI, and 
the Northeast Distribution Company, ENSA, are 
three main distribution companies in Panama. 
The companies are regulated, and their profit 
is linked to a rate on their net assets and their 
efficiency (distribution grid infrastructure), as an 
economic method to improve the quality of their 
service. They are also allowed to provide 15% of 
their demand with their own generation assets. 
Following the privatisation of the Hydraulic 
Resources and Electrification Institute, distribution 
losses were reduced considerably due to improved 
management and increased investment in the 
distribution system (Figure 10).

2.3 POWER SECTOR OVERVIEW
Since the 1980s, electricity demand in Panama’s 
Nationally Interconnected System (SIN) (Figure 14) 
has continued to increase, reaching peak demand 
of over 1 600 megawatts (MW) in 2015 (Figure 
11). Installed power capacity has also continued 
to grow, reaching 3 379 MW in 2016. The largest 
source in the electricity mix is hydropower, followed 
by thermal generation (oil products and coal).
Wind and solar power came on line in 2013, and 
by 2016 Panama had 270 MW of installed wind 
power capacity and 90 MW of installed solar 
power capacity (SNE, 2015). In addition, biogas 
was deployed in 2016, with an installed capacity of 
8.1 MW (Figure 12).

Gross electricity generaon (GWh)
Coal Oil and oil products Hydropower Solar Wind Total
As shown in Figure 13, electricity generation in 
Panama has been dominated by hydropower. Wind 
and solar generation began in 2013, and reached 
625.2 gigawatt hours (GWh) of onshore wind and 
71.4 (GWh) of solar PV in 2016 (SNE, 2017a). Gross 
electricity generation saw an annual growth rate of 
around 6.7% between 2010 and 2016, reaching a total 
of 10.8 gigawatt hours (GWh) in 2016, compared to 
4.8 GWh in 2000. Coal has only been used since 
2011, corresponding to an average of 7% of gross 
electricity generation from 2011 to 2016 (Figure 13). 
The share of oil and oil products in the generation 
mix has reduced from 37% in 2014 to 27% in 2016, 
but is still the second-largest electricity generation 
source after hydro.

Thermal Hydropower Wind Solar Biogas TotalPOWER SYSTEM REGULATION
The desire to maintain adequate generation resources 
to meet demand at all times is reflected in Panama’s 
current reserve margin, which has fluctuated between 
15% and 20% in recent years (ETESA, 2017a). The 
current reserve margin appears to be in line with the 
high end of margins applied in other jurisdictions, and 
no immediate generation scarcity can be identified. 
Should low utilisation rates of conventional generators 
be experienced in the future, their impact on the 
power market and declining reserve margins would 
likely need to be monitored closely. 
Wind and solar PV in Panama have been assigned 
a value of zero with regard to their firm capacity 
(Table 1). This has led ASEP to undertake an in-depth 
assessment to better understand the true value of 
firm capacity from wind and solar PV in the power 
market. A refined approach in calculating the reserve 
margin, taking into account the true contributions 
of VRE, is likely to help avoid situations of over- or 
under-capacity in Panama.
Wholesale electricity prices in Panama are impacted 
heavily by weather patterns. El Niño produces 
dry seasons that reduce water resources and thus 
hydropower output, raising the marginal cost of 
electricity as more thermal generation is needed. 
Conversely, La Niña causes strong storms and 
increases water resources, causing a reduction in the 
average marginal cost of electricity.
Box 1: Panama’s definition of firm capacity for VRE 
The concept of firm capacity was introduced with the creation of the MEN in Panama, and is 
calculated and periodically revised by the National Dispatch Centre (CND). It refers to the actual 
amount of power that a generator (electricity supplier) can guarantee to make available under 
maximum operating conditions. Firm capacity is a commitment assumed by the generator, and 
is used by regulators to ensure that the standards governing the reliability of the grid are met. 
In Panama, the firm capacity for VRE (solar and wind energy) is attributed a value of zero, given 
the intermittent nature of their output and non-dispatchability. Wind and solar generators have 
expressed several concerns regarding this practice, especially as the zero-attribution is likely 
to be below the real contribution of these technologies. The attribution of zero firm capacity 
can result in an artificially reduced revenue stream for wind and solar PV generators, as the 
Panamanian market remunerates firmness. Furthermore, as Panamanian transmission capacity 
can be a constraining factor at specific locations and times, the zero firm capacity attribution 
may require curtailment of wind and solar PV as only firm capacity resources are considered 
when scheduling generators ahead of time. 
The Panamanian market rules compensate curtailment at the level of wholesale market prices, 
which can be volatile and often lower than PPA prices for the cheapest solar PV and wind 
generation facilities. This linkage between curtailment and wholesale market prices then adds 
price volatility and the risk of reduced remuneration levels to wind and solar investors. National Interconnected System (SIN) capacities in MW

In 1997, Panama restructured its electricity sector 
and developed a wholesale market. This included 
the hourly energy spot market and the daily 
generation capacity spot market. In addition, the 
contract market serves as a third market, where 
bilateral PPAs between producers and off-takers 
are organised. These PPAs help to limit risk and 
stabilise prices for end customers, while creating 
greater cash flow certainty for investors. The use of 
three markets provides investors with opportunities 
to find a balance between their investment risk and 
their expected rate on return, as participation in 
the contract market is not obligatory.Box 2: Electricity sector investment and the role of PPAs 
Panama uses auctions to determine capacities and prices within the contract market, including 
for renewable energy. ASEP sets auction guidelines, and ETESA arranges the auctions on behalf 
of off-takers – Panama’s three distribution companies. Panama held its first wind auction in 2011, 
followed by a second wind auction in 2013. In 2014, Panama undertook its first solar PV auction. 
As of May 2018, no further auctions for VRE have been held.
The wind auctions resulted in the award of projects with a total capacity of 158 MW and 125 MW 
respectively, at prices between USD 95 per MWh and USD 110 per MWh in 2011, and between 
USD 92 per MWh and USD 97.5 per MWh in 2013. The majority of wind capacity operational in 
Panama has been built under the use of PPAs, with the exception of a 25.5 MW wind project 
which was commissioned in 2012. 
The solar PV auction resulted in five companies being awarded a total estimated generation 
capacity of around 60 MW, with prices between USD 86 per MWh and USD 94.9 per MWh. 
However, as of April 2016, ETESA had only signed PPAs with two out of the five companies, 
representing around 24 MW of capacity, with none of the projects being commissioned yet 
(BNEF, 2017).
These results indicate that PPA contracts have a high degree of relevance in facilitating wind 
investment, and less so for solar PV investment. As such, the merchant solar PV development that 
has taken place can be explained by the sufficiently high wholesale market prices for solar PV 
installations in recent years. However, Panama’s wholesale electricity market prices are expected 
to decline in the future, beginning in 2018. In its 2016 assessments, ETESA expected market 
prices to drop by some 15% to USD 61.3 per MWh until 2019, and despite growing electricity 
demand, anticipates prices to remain below USD 70 per MWh in the next decade. At the same 
time, Panama intends to expand fossil generation in the short term, with a 380 MW combinedcycle gas facility in Costa Norte planned to come on line in 2018 (ETESA, 2017b). 
This development is likely to reduce the number of hours with very high market prices, as 
expensive oil facilities and inefficient plants may be replaced by the new less expensive natural 
gas generation, which has a higher firm capacity value than solar and wind energy under 
Panama’s current wholesale market regulation. 
Looking ahead, price uncertainty and the attribution of zero firm capacity to solar is likely 
to influence investment decisions, making the role of PPAs even more important. This could 
negatively affect the business case for planned solar PV plants that would rely on the wholesale 
markets alone, creating conditions that do not fully support a renewable energy scale-up in line 
with the PEN 2015-2050.

ETESA (2017b), Plan de Expansión del Sistema Interconectado Nacional 2017-2031: Tomo II.To meet the future targets for wind and solar 
PV, the reliance on PPAs is likely to grow for both 
technologies. However, during IRENA’s RRA 
consultations, stakeholders highlighted structural 
challenges with current PPAs that may negatively 
influence investment behaviour. While such an 
assessment is outside the scope of this RRA, 
several factors appear to be particularly relevant: 
the technology-neutrality of current remuneration 
schemes in combination with an assigned zero 
capacity factor for wind and solar PV; assignment 
of delivery points; curtailment rules, especially in 
combination with transmission constraints; and 
the time resolution for calculating energy supply 
requirements and energy supply remuneration.
Based on feedback obtained in the course of RRA 
consultations, which highlighted PPAs as a key area 
for further assessment, IRENA initiated a technical 
assistance project under the CECCA initiative. This 
project aims to support the Government of Panama in 
addressing one of the recommendations of this RRA 
(Section 4.1).
TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM
ETESA’s transmission system consists mainly of 10 
sections of 230 kilovolt (kV) lines that stretch from 
the Bayano Hydroelectric power station to the east 
of Panama City, to the Progreso substation on the 
border with Costa Rica. It also has 115 kV lines from 
the Bahía Las Minas thermal power station in Colón 
to the Panama I substation, and another section 
from the Caldera substation to the La Estrella and 
Los Valles hydroelectric plants. A 400 kV direct 
current (DC) interconnection with Colombia is also 
under development. The lower-voltage distribution 
system is divided into three main service territories, 
each served by its own distribution company.

The National Dispatch Centre (CND) is responsible 
for carrying out the centralised operation of the 
national electricity system. In this capacity, it 
undertakes the planning of generation resources 
needed to satisfy energy demand on a weekly 
basis, over a planning period of two years. This is 
implemented in accordance with market rules and 
is based on the updated information provided by 
generators, verified by the CND when necessary. 
The CND’s planning also takes into account a range 
of factors, including rainfall and wind forecasts, fuel 
costs, demand, regional exchanges, availability and 
maintenance of plants and equipment. 
Once the results are verified to be consistent, the 
CND issues the official weekly stochastic study, 
which includes 104 weeks of power dispatching 
and the calculation of water cost from reservoirs 
that have values equal to or higher than USD 0/
MWh. Based on these results, the CND performs 
weekly pre-dispatch on an hourly basis, taking the 
first week of the stochastic study and detailing the 
energy dispatching of the 168 hours of the week. 
This is then used as the basis for the daily predispatch the following day, updating certain data 
such as generator availability, regional electricity 
market (MER) transactions and resources.
The daily and weekly pre-dispatches reflect the 
increasing economic merit order of the units. Runof-river hydro units, solar and wind power plants 
are dispatched first with zero variable cost. Thermal 
generators are dispatched with a variable cost 
associated with their efficiency, declared fuel price 
and their variable maintenance and operation. Hydro 
reservoir plants are dispatched with their variable 
cost calculated when the weekly dispatch is made.
In the real-time dispatch, the CND takes the daily predispatch as a guide to make its real-time decisions, 
giving instructions to all power plants on how to 
operate, when to be cycled on or off, and when to be 
ramped up or down. VRE generation, such as solar 
and wind energy, are dispatched per their resource 
availability and under close communication between 
the system controllers and plant operators. 
The CND maintains sufficient spinning reserves, as 
well as storage in the form of hydropower reservoirs, 
to ensure the system is balanced and mitigate the 
risk of sharp supply variations. In addition, the MER 
also contributes spinning and non-spinning reserves 
in real time.
POWER SYSTEM OPERATIONAL PLANNING
The operational planning of the power system is 
undertaken by the CND, which conducts technical 
and economic assessments across different time 
horizons and at varying time scales (CND, 2018a):
1. Midterm operational planning: This is a forwardlooking assessment of the operation of the power 
system over a two-year time horizon,4 which aims 
to provide a forecast of the expected generation 
resources necessary to supply demand (future cost 
function of water, expected values for utilisation of 
available generation resources, marginal operating 
costs, level of the reservoirs and potential nonserved load). The assessment is updated every six 
months. 
2.Midterm transmission network constraint 
assessment: This is a technical assessment of the 
constraints in the operation of the transmission 
network with a forward-looking two-year time 
horizon. It aims to identify system constraints, 
as well as the operational measures necessary to 
guarantee the security of system operation. The 
study is updated every year. 
3.One-year-ahead transmission network security 
assessment: This is a technical assessment of the 
constraints of the operation of the transmission 
network with a one-year-ahead time horizon. 
Similar to the two-year forward-looking study, it 
aims to identify the constraints of the transmission 
system and the need for operational measures to 
guarantee security of system operation. The study 
is updated every year and includes assessments 
similar to the midterm assessment, with a focus 
on priority operational issues for the shorter time 
horizon.
Besides the CND’s operational planning assessments 
described above, the operational code requires the 
conduct of technical interconnection studies for new 
generating units, including VRE sources, to ensure 
that the integration of the new resources will not 
Power system planning affect the system’s stability (CND, 2018a).
will remain critical in Panama’s 
evolving energy sectorINFRASTRUCURE PLANNING
ETESA oversees the annual update of generation 
and transmission expansion plans. These plans are 
based on techno-economic studies that assess 
the performance of the system under different 
scenarios. As the development of new power plants 
is, in principle, carried out by private investors 
(with ASEP providing permissions), the generation 
expansion plan is only indicative in character. It aims 
to provide policy makers and market stakeholders 
with appropriate signals for policy development 
or investment decisions. However, in the past the 
majority of bids for the construction of new power 
plants have been carried out at the request of the 
regulator, bearing in mind the indicative plan.
The Generation Expansion Plan looks at a 15-
year time horizon. The first five years assume the 
commissioning of new plants based on projects 
with licence-holders and concessions. For the 
following ten years, an optimal generation expansion 
mix is calculated under different scenarios using 
optimisation and simulation-of-operation software 
tools. Currently the assessments for the plan consider 
a co ordinated, but not integrated, operation with 
other countries participating in the MER.
The Transmission Expansion Plan is a ten-year 
optimal investment plan, aiming to eliminate existing 
and projected system constraints. The plan looks at 
operational costs, losses and the overall reliability 
of the system, and is based on techno-economic 
assessments of system performance. The studies 
use scenarios from the Generation Expansion Plan 
and are based on detailed steady-state and dynamic 
simulations of the transmission network, with a 
model implemented in Power System Simulation for 
Engineering (PSSE) to evaluate the performance of 
the system. Once approved by ASEP, the Transmission 
Expansion Plan must be implemented by ETESA. 
The infrastructure planning process could be 
strengthened for better integration of VRE. This 
includes improving the modelling and forecasting of 
VRE technologies, and their complementarity with 
baseload hydropower. More detailed infrastructure 
and operational planning processes, which include 
higher shares of VRE penetration, will require the 
evaluation of system flexibility and a VRE generation 
forecast system, among other operational 
considerations. 
ELECTRICITY MARKET TRANSACTIONS
Electricity market transactions are directly linked with 
power system operations. Once the CND finishes the 
daily dispatch of the generation units, it performs the 
post-dispatch preparation for the following day. This 
is a document similar to pre-dispatch except that it 
contains data on real demand, exports or imports, 
and generation from power plants, as well as the 
generation that was estimated in the pre-dispatch 
but which faced disruption to supply.
This method ensures that any malfunctioning power 
plants do not affect the calculated hourly price or 
the system marginal cost (CMS). The CMS is marked 
hourly by the variable cost of the last generation unit 
required to meet the demand. In this calculation, 
the units that are on line for reasons other than 
supplying load (such as those subject to operational 
restrictions or providing operational safety) are not 
considered. 
Figure 15 shows the historical yearly average of 
the CMS since 1999. At first the CMS was low, but 
then began to increase sharply between 2006 and 
2014 mainly due to increases in fuel costs, as well 
as a failure to organise tenders for new investment 
to meet demand growth on time. In 2015, it began 
to decrease following a drop in fuel prices and the 
growth of VRE generation.Figure 15: Historical yearly average of the CMS (1999-2017)
Based on CND (2018b), Oficial Historico Costo Marginal,
www.cnd.com.pa/descargar_archivo.php?nombre=Oficial_Historico_Costo_Marginal.zip&tipo_informe=38&ano=2018.
With the post-dispatch prepared, the CND 
undertakes the preliminary market liquidation for 
the day and considers the PPAs from the different 
market actors. If an actor does not have a PPA, it 
sells or buys all the generated energy on the spot 
market or at the CMS price. If another actor has a 
commitment to supply a volume of energy under 
a PPA and its power units generate a surplus, the 
difference between these volumes of energy is sold 
on the spot market. If the supplier did not generate 
enough energy to fulfil the PPA requirement, it 
must buy the deficit on the spot market. The CND 
organises these assignments of sales and purchases 
for the spot market hourly.
At the end of the month, the CND prepares and 
distributes to all market actors a report called an 
economic transactions document that is a summary 
of the hourly transactions for the month. A schedule 
of activities is attached to the document, indicating 
the deadlines for depositing the amounts due and 
the time when the liquidating bank will transfer the 
registered credits on each account.
The liquidating bank is responsible for verifying that 
all actors have transferred the funds registered in 
the economic transactions document. If there are 
any missing deposits, they will be reported to the 
CND, which will then order the bank to execute the 
compliance guarantee to that actor. 
The CND conducts a weekly verification of the actors’ 
firm capacity. First, the average weekly capacity is 
calculated for each power plant, considering the firm 
capacity included in any contracts. These values are 
then compared with the committed energy, which 
should be less than the calculated weekly capacity 
of the power plant. If this is not the case, the actor 
is penalised. 
The CND records all market statistics, which are 
publicly accessible online. The liquidating bank 
oversees the spot market transactions, while the 
transactions that are part of PPAs are settled 
between the actors involved in such contracts.

CMS (USD/MWh)ELECTRICITY TARIFFS
The electricity tariff structure is developed by the 
distribution companies and approved by the ASEP. 
The electricity tariff comprises four elements: 
generation; transmission; distribution; and 
commercialisation. Transmission and distribution 
costs are regulated and have historically been about 
USD 0.01 per kilowatt hour (kWh) for transmission 
and USD 0.05/kWh for distribution. Generation 
costs are determined on the wholesale market with 
the purchase of energy and firm power by the final 
user through PPAs, and/or the purchase of energy 
on the spot market. If PPAs are insufficient to cover 
all demand of final users at any hour, the CND will 
then assign a distribution company to purchase this 
difference in the spot market.
Tariff details are published every six months by the 
ASEP. The values in force until 30 June 2018 are 
shown in Annex II.
The end-user tariffs determined by distribution 
companies, which were previously classified only 
based on consumer type (residential, commercial, 
industrial and government customers), also vary 
according to the consumer’s level of consumption 
and voltage:
• Rates for customers connected to low-voltage 
grids (equal to or under 600 volts):
 Simple Rate for customers with demand equal 
to or under 15 kilowatts (kW) per month
 Maximum Demand Rate for customers with 
demand over 15 kW per month
 Time Block Rate for customers upon their 
request, which allows for a range of prices 
depending on the electricity supply schedule 
(peak or off-peak periods).
• Rates for customers connected to mediumvoltage grids (over 600 volts and under 115 kV) or 
high-voltage grids (over 115 kV):
 Maximum Demand Rate available to customers 
upon their request
 Time Block Rate providing a range of prices 
depending on the electricity supply schedule 
(peak or off-peak periods).
The rates include adjustments for changes in fuel 
prices, rebates for unused energy costs and actor 
penalties, as well as subsidies for final consumers 
with very low consumption levels

2.4 CROSS-BORDER POWER TRADE 
Panama currently has three 230 kV cross-border 
transmission lines: 
• from the Progreso substation in Panama to the Rio 
Claro substation in Costa Rica
• the Central American Electric Interconnection 
System (SIEPAC) line section from the Veladero 
substation in Panama to the Rio Claro substation 
in Costa Rica 
• from the Changuinola substation in Panama to the 
Cahuita substation in Costa Rica (ETESA, 2017a).
Panama and Colombia are also jointly developing a 
400 kV DC interconnection, which would connect 
the MER with South America. The ColombiaPanama Electric Interconnection (ICP) is the owner 
of the project and is leading its development. 
Interconexiones Eléctricas S.A., Colombia’s electricity 
transmission company, and ETESA have equal 
ownership of the project.
The interconnection of Central American countries 
began with bilateral transmission interconnections 
between neighbouring countries. Early on, energy 
transfers were only carried out in blocks of between 
bilateral connections have evolved into a regional 
transmission line linking six Central American countries, 
which is conceived as the SIEPAC (Figure 16). 
In light of the strong political support for the regional 
project by Central American countries, the Marco 
Treaty of the Electricity Market of Central America 
was signed in 1996, which gave rise to the creation 
of the MER that relies on the SIEPAC infrastructure. 
Presently, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, 
Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama are part of the MER.
THE MARCO TREATY
Signed by the six governments in 1996 and coming 
into force in 1999, the Marco Treaty of the Electricity 
Market of Central America established the Regional 
Operations Entity (EPR), which owns the SIEPAC line. 
Furthermore, the treaty led to the creation of a regional 
regulator, the Regional Commission for Electrical 
Interconnection (CRIE), and a regional market operator, 
Regional Operator Entity (EOR) (World Bank, 2011).5
Located in Guatemala, the CRIE started operations 
in 2000 as the regulatory authority of the regional 
market with its legitimacy recognised by all parties 
to the Marco Treaty. It has an Executive Secretary 
and a Board of Commissioners consisting of one 
representative from each countrywhich is often a 
Source: EOR (2017a), Operational Link Nodes (Nodos de Enlaces Operativos), www.enteoperador.org/#.The EOR was created in 2001 and as its own legal 
entity that is applicable to SIEPAC countries 
(Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, 
Nicaragua and Panama). It has an Executive Director 
and a Board of Directors, which consists of two 
representatives from each country, who are typically 
the director of the national system operator and a 
representative of the national market actors. The 
EOR is headquartered in El Salvador, together with 
the Regional Dispatch Centre (World Bank, 2011).
The Second Protocol to the Marco Treaty established 
the Steering Committee of the Regional Electricity 
Market (CDMER), which is located in Costa Rica. 
The CDMER is responsible for promoting the 
development of the EOR, and taking decisions 
to achieve the objectives of the Marco Treaty and 
its protocols. To this end, it set up co ordination 
mechanisms with the CRIE and the EOR. 
Under the CRIE’s regulation of the MER, each 
member country is allowed to operate per their own 
national rules; however, there must be effective co 
ordination at the regional level. The MER is a day-today trading market, itemised by the hour. All actors 
of the member countries are also members of the 
MER, and can undertake contracts and transactions 
with actors from different countries.
REGIONAL ELECTRICITY TRANSACTIONS
Transactions in the MER are made between actors 
from different countries, which can be through firm 
contracts, non-firm contracts or spot transactions. 
Firm contracts can be made monthly or annually and 
include a fee to obtain transmission rights (Derecho 
de Transmisión [DT]), which guarantees the right to 
transmit contracted energy between the actors. The 
fee is paid to the EOR monthly and is distributed 
among the transmission companies that participate 
in the DT (World Bank, 2011). 
Non-firm contracts can be agreed between 
two actors on a daily basis. One of the actors is 
responsible for the regional transmission charges, 
known as Transmission Variable Costs, which are 
calculated hourly as the cost difference between the 
injection and withdrawal point in the system (nodal 
pricing).
The third option is spot transactions, which can be 
imported by the CND, or opportunity offers, which 
can be exported by actors. In Panama, opportunity 
offers to purchase imports or withdrawals from the 
regional transmission network are only made by the 
CND on behalf of the market. The CND makes an offer 
to purchase energy for each hour of the following day 
from the MER, using a price lower than the variable 
cost of the last dispatched unit in the national market, 
creating the ability to replace a more expensive 
generator in the national market.
For export opportunity offers, the CND publishes daily 
on its website an hourly template listing all national 
energy surplus not dispatched (surplus available 
for export), also indicating the variable cost of each 
generator. The regional market actors that wish to buy 
fill out a template indicating the amount of power in 
MWh and the price of their offer, which must be equal 
to or greater than the corresponding variable cost, and 
upload it to the CND website before 13:30. The CND 
sends all the offers to the EOR, which allocates the 
purchasing/selling intentions of the actors. Every day, 
it issues the regional pre-dispatch where the allocated 
and non-allocated purchases and sales appear.
At the end of the month, the EOR develops a Regional 
Economic Transactions Document, which shows the 
summary of all transactions settled in the month. 
This information also includes a calendar of actions 
where actors who have debts must transfer the credits 
into the account of the regional liquidating bank in a 
specific period. To participate in the MER, all agents 
must have guarantees of payment at the liquidating 
bank. The EOR deducts the amount of credits from the 
value of the guarantee in the daily transactions, thus 
validating that no transactions will take place without 
a guarantee.
Figure 17 displays SIEPAC injection transactions from 
2013 to October 2016, which show upward growth over 
the years. 
5 Transmission rights (DT) is a system of trading the rights to using transmission lines. 
The transmission entity (EOR in this case) will issue rights to use the regional line (SIEPAC) and make it available to buyers and sellers of electricity 
in the region. The regional energy buyer/seller will then buy these transmission rights in order to use the line to transmit/transport the energy across 
the region for their needs.A robust workforce will be 
essential to underpin Panama’s 
growing solar PV and wind 
energy market

Based on EOR (2017b), Transaction information (Informe de Transacciones), www.enteoperador.org/#. 
Panama has considerably increased its electricity 
exports since 2010, reaching 5.4% of total electricity 
generation in 2016. Meanwhile electricity imports have 
varied over the years, but due to the high exports in 
recent years, imports have seen values of less than 1% 
of total electricity generation (Figure 18).

Export Import2.5 ENERGY POLICY AND REGULATORY 
FRAMEWORK
NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY
The SNE is responsible for establishing national 
energy policy and strategy, and developing a longterm plan to assure the reliability of the energy 
system and security of supply. It entails policy, 
economic and regulatory aspects of energy, and 
aims to:
1. Provide the entire population with a 
modern and reliable energy system
2. Reduce the carbon content of the energy 
supply
3. Make rational and efficient use of energy 
resources
4. Ensure uninterrupted national energy 
supply.
Panama’s national energy policy considers eight 
actions in line with the sustainable development of 
the energy sector:
1. Drafting of a long-term plan for the 
country’s energy sector development
2. Comprehensive management of water 
basins
3. Spatial planning
4. Development of pricing for the carbon 
content of energy
5. Implementation of the Law on the Rational 
and Efficient use of Energy 
6. Reorganisation of the laws on renewable 
sources
7. Sustainable cities
8. Energy and education programme.
NATIONAL ENERGY PLAN 2015-2050
In March 2016, the Government of Panama approved 
the PEN 2015-2050. The plan was undertaken by 
the SNE and was developed following country-wide 
public forums involving the government and more 
than 800 people from civil society, the public and 
private sectorsand indigenous communities
The plan outlines the general and conceptual 
guidelines for Panama’s energy sector over the next 
35 years, and serves as a roadmap for diversifying the 
energy sector and advancing energy access, energy 
efficiency, energy security and the decarbonisation 
of the energy system. It is divided into five parts: 
1. Conceptual guidelines for the sustainable 
development of the sector
2. The 2015-2019 Short-Term Operational Plan
3. Scenarios (reference and alternative)
4. Proposal for a long-term energy policy
 (2015-2050)
5. Report of the consultative process.
The plan analyses two possible scenarios (reference 
and alternative) and compares them to identify main 
actions to enable the achievement of the national 
energy sector goals as described through the 
alternative scenario. 
The plan analyses a base case (reference scenario), 
which assumes historical projected growth without 
the implementation of any regulations intending to 
curb demand, and contrasts it with other alternatives 
that consider both consumption efficiency and 
responsibility (for example, through the expansion 
of mass-transit solutions and high-efficiency 
refrigeration and other home appliances) and the 
incorporation of renewable energy and less carbonintensive fuels (such as solar, wind and liquefied 
natural gas generation) in order to decarbonise the 
Panamanian energy supply. 
Concerning electricity, the reference case shows that 
Panama’s demand growth trajectory would lead to a 
higher share of coal in the power mix by 2050. The 
ambitious scenario, however, suggests that renewable 
energy could reach 70% of supply in the next 35 
years, while meeting growth in demand (SNE, 2015).
According to the reference scenario, which 
establishes a baseline assuming a “business-asusual” scenario, the distribution of electricity 
consumption shows a marked increase between 
2014 and 2050 in the commercial sector, with the 
losses to the system remaining in the range of 13-
14%. At the same time, annual consumption would 
increase from 9 000 GWh today to 56 000 GWh in 0

The reference scenario suggests steady growth 
in thermal generation, with around 10 000 MW 
of installed capacity by 2050, and a stagnation of 
renewables and hydropower capacity after 2020. 
Thermal sources account for 76% of the electricity 
mix, while renewables (hydro, solar and wind) only 
cover 24% (Figure 20).

paradigm and reach a desired energy future. In this 
scenario, energy efficiency measures have been 
expanded from their current low application so that

Based on SNE (2015), Plan Energético Nacional (2015-2050).
Renewables hold a significantly larger share of the 
electricity mix than thermal sources in the alternative 
scenario. By 2050, with the implementation of 
adequate policies, non-conventional renewables 
(solar and wind energy) would exceed an installed 
capacity of 8 000 MW, and when accounting for 
hydro, renewables take a 77% share of the power 
mix (Figure 21).
Thermal sources, meanwhile, would only reach an 
installed capacity of just over 5 000 MW by 2050, 
around half of the thermal capacity under the 
reference scenario (Figure 20). 
Achieving the alternative scenario of the PEN 2015-
2050 would have significant implications across the 
energy sector (SNE, 2015):
• Electricity demand: A reduction in electricity 
demand through increased energy efficiency 
(including better building design) and reduced 
transmission and distribution losses. Compared to 
the reference case, electricity demand drops by 
35%.
• Electricity supply: Total installed capacity in 
the alternative scenario is 18% higher than the 
reference case. Increased solar and wind capacity, 
together with hydropower and biomass, accounts 
for around 77% of installed capacity.
• Fossil fuel consumption: Gasoline and diesel 
consumption is reduced by 42% and 29%, 
respectively. This is due to a more electrified 
transport sector, including through a greater use 
of the Panama metro and increased adoption of 
electric vehicles. LPG consumption is reduced by 
31% due to its substitution by electric stoves in 
households, resulting in an increase in electricity 
demand in the residential sector of 7.2%.
• Carbon dioxide (CO2
) emissions: A 61% reduction 
in CO2
 emissions compared to the reference case. III. RENEWABLE ENERGY 
DEVELOPMENT
3.1 RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCE POTENTIAL 
AND DEVELOPMENT
The renewable energy potential of Panama is abundant and diverse, and includes 
resources such as hydro, wind, solar, geothermal, marine and biomass (bagasse, 
husk, wood, charcoal, peat, biogas and bioethanol). Despite its vast untapped 
potential, Panama’s energy needs are largely met with fossil fuel resources. 
The potential and status of development of renewable energy resources in Panama 
are discussed below.
HYDROPOWER
Hydropower is the largest electricity source in the country, with an installed capacity 
of 1769 MW in 2016, corresponding to a 53% share of the total installed capacity 
(Figure 11). Hydro potential has been extensively studied, revealing an estimated 
potential of approximately 11 879 GWh/year (translating to an installed capacity of 2 
389 MW, with an average net capacity factor of 0.57) (SNE, 2015). A total of 42 sites 
have been identified for plants with a capacity under 1 MW, and 53 sites for plants 
over 1 MW. The potential for large plants over 100 MW has been exhausted, with the 
latest being the 220 MW Changuinola II project, planned by EGESA (SNE, 2015). 
WIND ENERGY
Panama’s wind resources are spread throughout the country, and improve along the 
Caribbean coast and at several wind passages on mountain ranges. IRENA’s Global 
Atlas shows average wind speed estimates of 5-7 metres per second (m/s) at a height 
of 200 metres (m) (Figure 23). According to the PEN 2015-2050, measurements 
undertaken for ETESA at 40 m high have identified sites with average speeds of 
between 6 m/s and 11 m/s together with a capacity factor of 35% (SNE, 2015). 
Offshore wind energy potential has yet to be assessed. 
Panama has 270 MW of installed wind power capacity, located entirely in the 
municipality of Penonomé, in the province of Coclé (SNE, 2015). As of February 2017, 
ASEP had granted 662 MW of permanent wind licences for the future development of 
projects that would allow developers to begin construction; these licences required 
guarantees from the applicants, which would be executed should the project not be 
completed, especially under PPA obligations. Provisional licences for an amount of 
870 MW were also granted for future development of wind. Figure 23: Wind resource assessment in Panama

Furthermore, IRENA’s suitability maps show 
potentially viable areas for the development of 
decentralised wind power systems (systems that are 
not connected to the distribution or transmission 
grid) and for systems connected to the grid. The maps 
indicate the potential wind resource for developing 
wind projects through a range of yellow-red colours 
(yellow being less suitable, and dark red being the 
most suitable). To verify this, existing wind power 
plants and those under construction are marked on 
the map, corroborating the reliability of the analysis 
for the two wind farms to the south. The suitability 
analysis for grid-connected wind power shows that 
Panama’s wind generation facilities correspond to 
the areas with higher resource (Figure 24), while the 
areas suitable for decentralised wind remain distant 
from the main transmission system but within strong 
resource areas (Figure 25).

Box 3: Global Atlas for Renewable Energy
As part of IRENA’s project facilitation support to its Members, the Agency’s renewables assessment 
includes publication of resource maps through the publicly available Global Renewable Energy 
Atlas. The tool holds over 2 000 maps and zonal suitability assessments, and integrates maps 
with key local information such as distance to transmission infrastructure, population and 
topography, which can help identify zones suitable for development. 
In 2017, Global Atlas 3.0 was launched, which now includes solar and wind resource maps with a 1 
km spatial resolution that are extensively validated. Through the zoning methodology, IRENA has 
supported regional market analysis for Latin America to identify suitable zones for both utilityscale and decentralised solar and wind development, which provide an indicative technical 
potential. Grid connected solar PV

SOLAR ENERGY
Panama receives an average irradiance of 
4.8 kWh/m2
/day, with the strongest resource 
being identified at the south of the provinces of 
Chiriquí and Veraguas, with an average of over 
5 kWh/m2
/day (SNE, 2015). Solar has been exploited 
in the country to a very limited extent, primarily in 
rural areas and isolated industrial applications, such 
as communication systems, lighting on marine 
buoys, and drying processes in agriculture. 
Solar power plants started to be installed in the 
country in 2013 and the installed capacity of solar 
power reached 90 MW in 2016, and 127 MW as of 
June 2017 (Table 1). As of February 2017, ASEP 
had granted permanent solar licences for future 
development of 345 MW, and provisional licences 
for 376 MW.
Highly suitable areas for the location of solar 
PV plants are quite wide-ranging and offer a 
significant opportunity. Figures 26 and 27 show 
IRENA’s suitability maps displaying solar resources 
throughout the country, both for grid-connected 
and decentralised generation facilities. The maps 
reveal higher solar potential throughout most of 
the country than for wind, with the most suitable 
areas being in the south and west regions of 
Panama given the proximity to grid infrastructure.

Preliminary geothermal potential assessments 
began in Panama in the 1970s. However, further sitespecific studies and evaluation have not taken place 
since, leaving resource estimates to vary widely. The 
preliminary studies identified 23 areas as sources of 
hot water in the country, and three of these sources 
have the technical potential for geothermal energy 
exploitation: Calobre in the province of Veraguas; 
Cerro Colorado in the province of Chiriquí; and 
El Valle de Antón in the province of Coclé. Other 
locations with geothermal potential were also 
located, including Tonosí in the province of Los 
Santos, and Coiba Island (SNE, 2015).
Panama has sought to exploit its geothermal 
resources. In early 2017, the Technical University of 
Panama organised its first geothermal expedition to 
identify possible new sources of geothermal energy 
in the country (Richter, 2017). Plans were also 
announced for a possible 5 MW geothermal project 
in the Chiriquí province that would become the 
country’s first geothermal generating unit (Richter, 
2013). 
Barriers including high upfront costs and investment 
risks, particularly in the exploration phase, must 
be overcome for Panama’s successful geothermal 
development. The primary cause of the high 
investment risk is the lack of resource studies in 
Panama that can differentiate the availability of high, 
medium and low enthalpy geothermal resources. 
BIOMASS 
Biomass potential varies greatly depending on 
human activity. Cane bagasse has been used 
traditionally in sugar mills as a source of energy for 
sugar processing and to produce electricity, and it has 
an estimated annual electricity generation potential 
of about 28 GWh (SNE, 2015). The drying process 
of coffee and rice crops generates coffee and rice 
husks, which are also used as fuel to produce heat. 
Wood and charcoal have traditionally been used in 
cooking in rural and small industrial areas, such as 
bakeries and grain drying. 
A peat deposit of 80 km2
 by 8 m of thickness has 
been identified in the province of Bocas del Toro, 
with an estimated mass of 118 million tonnes, 
sufficient to feed a 30 MW steam plant for 30 years. 
Bioethanol is a by-product of biomass, and between 
2013 and 2014 a plant supplied this fuel product 
that was then mixed with gasoline at a rate of 5%. 
The plant ceased operations recently, although this 
activity is expected to resume in the future. Panama’s 
electricity market has an 8.1 MW diesel-based 
back-up plant (Urbalia Cerro Patacón), which uses 
methane as a by-product of waste. Additionally, the 
Project CADASA, a 30 MW capacity generator using 
bagasse, rice husks and other organic products is 
currently under construction (SNE, 2015). 
MARINE ENERGY 
Panama has almost 3 000 km of coastline with 
the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, and could take 
advantage of the differences between high and low 
tides – over 5 m in the Pacific Ocean. Both oceans 
have waves of varying intensities, frequencies and 
sizes that could be exploited. There are also offshore 
winds that could potentially be exploited along the 
Caribbean coast (Atlantic Ocean). Despite having 
vast marine energy resources, its potential has not 
been assessed yet. The SNE has considered studies 
in line with its future plans.3.2 RENEWABLE ENERGY POLICY AND 
SUPPORT SCHEMES 
With the liberalisation of the electricity sector in 1997-
1998, private investment began steadily pouring into 
the construction of new thermal generation facilities. 
At the same time, Panama had limited policies in 
place to support renewable energy deployment. 
An exception was Law 6 of 1997, which established 
Panama’s regulatory and institutional framework for 
the electricity sector, mandating a 5% price premium 
on renewable energy sources bidding in auctions 
(ASEP, 1997). 
In 2004, Panama sought to diversify its electricity mix 
by advancing a range of tax incentives for renewable 
energy project development through the adoption of 
Law 45, which allows renewable projects (less than or 
equal to 10 MW) to enter into a PPA with its respective 
electric distribution company, so long as electricity 
sales do not surpass 15% of the utility’s maximum 
demand (ASEP, 2004). In addition, the law exempts 
renewable generators from all imported equipment 
tax, and provides an income tax credit of up to 25% 
of project investment,6 which can be utilised up to 10 
years from the date of commissioning. The law also 
exempts renewable energy projects under 10 MW 
from transmission or distribution fees, while projects 
of between 10 MW and 20 MW pay no transmission 
or distribution fees for the first 10 MW for 10 years 
(ASEP, 2004). 
More recently, Panama established tax incentives for 
wind and solar energy. Law 44 of 2011 created windspecific auctions, as well as accelerated depreciation 
on wind equipment and tax exemption for up to 15 
years for wind equipment producers based in Panama. 
Law 37 of 2013 established solar-specific auctions in 
Panama, along with accelerated depreciation on solar 
energy equipment (ASEP, 2017).
Panama also maintains a net-metering scheme. 
Resolution AN No. 5399-Elec allows retail consumers 
with renewable generating units up to 500 kW to 
connect to the distribution grid and sell their excess 
generation. This surplus electricity is reimbursed by 
the consumer’s distribution company, at the average 
per kWh price that it charged retail customers in 
that year (ASEP, 2012). 
Through Law 42 of 2011, Panama developed an 
ethanol blending mandate of 10% in gasoline 
that was set to take effect in 2016. This law also 
established a 20% subsidy for feedstock costs in 
the first five years of operation of biofuel plants 
that process local biomass. Due to a lack of ethanol 
supply, the mandate was later suspended in 2014. 
However, the government still offers a tax credit of 
USD 0.159/litre to fuel blenders for the purchase of 
biofuels (IEA and IRENA, 2017). 
A prolonged drought in 2014 significantly reduced 
Panama’s hydropower generation, forcing the 
country to rely heavily on thermoelectric generation 
and electricity imports. As a result, the government 
announced its intent to continue developing nonhydro renewable sources to diversify the country’s 
energy supply.

3.3 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
OF RENEWABLE ENERGY
Research and development of renewable energy 
technology in Panama began in the 1970s. Today, 
universities in the country offer a wide range of 
engineering and technical courses to prepare 
students for work in the energy sector, including 
programmes in electromechanical engineering, 
electrical engineering, electronic engineering, civil 
engineering, industrial engineering and mechatronics 
engineering. Despite this, more emphasis is needed 
on equipping students with the technical, economic 
and institutional knowledge of renewable energy, 
particularly as it relates to growing shares of VRE in 
power systems, as proposed in the PEN 2015-2050. 
Moreover, training on planning with short- and longterm software programmes, operational forecasts 
for renewables, and the needs of control centres are 
still limited in Panama’s higher education. 
In response to this need, universities in Panama are 
beginning to tailor their programmes to suit the 
growing demand for renewable energy professionals. 
These include the energy and environmental 
engineering course offered by the Technological 
University of Panama (UTP) at the undergraduate, 
master’s and doctoral levels, and upcoming degrees 
at the University of Panama (UP) in electricity 
and renewable energy engineering. Furthermore, 
options are increasing at private universities to 
study geophysical engineering for the development 
of geothermal technology.
In addition to universities, Panama’s main institutions 
involved in the study and evaluation of renewable 
energy include the following: 
A. The Hydro and Hydrotechnical Research Centre
was created in 1980, and undertakes research 
related to water resources and the environment.
B. The Centre for Research and Innovation in 
Electrical and Mechanical Industry was created 
in 2011 as an Energy Savings Unit, a Department of 
Research and Development, and a Department of 
Production Services. Within this structure, it hosts 
three decentralised units: the Centre for Training 
in Renewable Energies, the Innovation and 
Technology Transfer Centre, and the Astronomical 
Observatory of Panama. 
C. The City of Knowledge is a development of more 
than 200 buildings and was established for the 
purpose of promoting sustainable development 
through international collaboration in the fields 
of business, academia and science. The city hosts 
several renewable energy companies, and its 
Vice Presidency for Business is responsible for 
identifying, attracting and recruiting companies, 
academic programmes, and research and training 
centres. 
D. ETESA’s Hydrometeorology Unit undertakes the 
planning, expansion, operation and maintenance 
of Panama’s national network of meteorological 
and hydrological observation stations and water 
quality monitoring stations, per the international 
standards established by the World Meteorological 
Organization (WMO).
E. The Panama Canal Authority was established 
as an autonomous legal unit, and is charged 
with overseeing the operation, administration, 
management, preservation, maintenance and 
modernisation of the canal. The authority has 
installed an experimental floating solar plant of 
22 kW, and will build further installations if the 
initial project is successful (Panama Today, 2017). 
This new solar generation would help displace 
fuel consumption, reduce the growth of aquatic 
vegetation in the lakes of the channel and reduce 
evaporation of the water of the lakes, while 
avoiding challenges related to land use.The Panama CanalIV. CHALLENGES AND 
RECOMMENDATIONS
4.1 OVERVIEW
In the 15 years following the privatisation of Panama’s electricity sector, more than 
1 500 MW of conventional hydro and thermal projects were awarded tenders with 
PPAs and enjoyed certain regulatory benefits,7 such as fiscal incentives and tax 
exemptions. Against this background, the SIN has traditionally relied on baseload 
hydropower and thermal generation assets since its inception, with generating units 
enjoying the recognition of payment for their capacity, energy and ancillary services, 
such as spinning reserve, secondary regulation, quick start, and others. 
Sarigua plant, the first solar plant in Panama with a capacity of 2 MW, was installed 
in 2013. After this milestone, new solar and wind projects have slowly emerged, all 
of which added up to 397 MW in June 2017. It has been difficult for these projects 
to compete effectively within a market that is geared towards conventional hydro 
and thermal power generation, as they are not offered payments for firm capacity.8, 9
The implementation of renewables has impacted the national market by lowering 
energy costs in the spot market, guaranteeing security of supply through the large 
volume of installed power and displacing thermal generation, thus reducing the 
country’s carbon footprint, generating skilled labour and lessening dependence on 
volatile oil prices. 
The system’s marginal costs have reduced since 2014 due to dropping fuel prices and 
the large volume of renewable energy injected since 2011, including VRE since 2013. 
The use of these technologies can push prices to zero in off-peak periods, due to 
their marginal cost allocation being zero. 
Table 2 shows how the number of hours when the CMS falls to zero has increased 
in recent years, which reduces prices in the spot market and can be threatening for 
actors who operate without a PPA. 
7 Actors with thermal plants can index the price of energy according to the variation of the price of fuel, while the selling price for hydropower is fixed.

At the same time, the increasing amount of new 
renewables generation has helped Panama export 
its excess power in the regional market. However, 
these benefits are at risk because VRE companies 
face economic challenges stemming from the 
current market model, which is based on more 
conventional sources such as hydropower and 
thermal generation, and does not recognise the 
unique operating characteristics of VRE generation. 
The government, seeking to improve these 
conditions, developed a series of special laws 
and grid connection codes for VRE to incentivise 
renewable energy development. However, further 
regulatory adjustments could be undertaken to 
ensure that renewables can operate on a level 
playing field with fossil generators, as opposed to 
the current regulatory environment that favours 
conventional hydropower and thermal generation.
4.2 KEY CHALLENGES AND 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
Variable renewable power, including wind and solar 
energy, are the main technologies outlined in the PEN 
2015-2050 to diversify and decarbonise Panama’s 
energy sector. At the same time, technological 
advances in other technologies, such as marine 
energyalso have the potential to make important 
The following recommended actions can help 
overcome barriers to enable an accelerated 
deployment of higher shares of renewables in an 
optimal way that supports the country’s transition 
to a sustainable energy future.
REGULATORY AND FINANCIAL INCENTIVES 
FOR VARIABLE RENEWABLES
Challenge: Considering the government’s 
ambition for a transition to 70% renewable energy 
in the national electricity mix by 2050, revised 
regulatory rules that provide a level playing field 
for renewables vis-à-vis conventional generation 
are required, especially in a competitive wholesale 
market with a medium-term outlook of low 
prices and transmission capacity constraints. 
The current regulatory framework conditions, 
and specifically the PPAs, are designed for 
dispatchable technologies such as coal, gas, oil 
and hydroelectricity, and do not incentivise new 
wind and solar PV projects.
Recommended Action: Assess the investment 
incentives for wind and solar PV projects under 
current and expected market conditions, with 
a specific focus on PPAs. Identify factors with a 
negative influence on investment behaviour and 
the required regulatory responses. Determine 
a set of implementable solutions leading to a compromising the efficient functioning of the 
Panamanian wholesale market. These could 
include an adjustment to the compensation for 
curtailment, a new calculation of PPA-related 
remuneration levels and a new definition of firm 
power that takes into account the operating 
characteristics of VRE.
POWER SYSTEM PLANNING WITH HIGH SHARES 
OF VARIABLE RENEWABLES 
Challenge: Planning will remain an important crosscutting area for Panama’s energy sector, as planners 
must cope with rising variability and uncertainty 
from the envisaged high penetration of solar and 
wind generation through to 2050. Without strong 
sets of quantitative techno-economic analyses to 
guide these planning efforts, however, generation 
expansion could be delayed, grid infrastructure 
development costs may be allocated inefficiently, 
and the overall reliable operation of the power 
system could be compromised. 
Recommended Action: Develop a national strategy 
to improve power system planning and modelling 
with higher penetrations of VRE.
This will support Panama’s power sector planning 
by defining long-term transition scenarios and nearterm actions that can link the development of the 
grid with the development of renewable energy 
generation, while aligning with periodic updates to 
the PEN 2015-2050. Moreover, it could rationalise 
the management of connection queues, reduce or 
avoid interrupting renewables generation, support 
the efficient use of the SIEPAC regional line, and cut 
overall costs of the electricity system.
NEW OPERATIONAL PRACTICES FOR THE 
POWER SYSTEM
Challenge: Power system operations in Panama 
still reflect the “old paradigm” of centralised, 
dispatchable generation units. Given the unique 
physical conditions of VRE sources, challenges 
emerge for system operation with high shares of 
variable renewables. These can largely be classified 
as: flexibility, system adequacy and system 
stability challenges. As such, reliably integrating 
large shares of wind and solar generation requires 
modifications to the CND’s operational practices 
as well as the identification of the necessary 
flexibility mechanisms. 
Recommended Action: Conduct a comprehensive 
assessment to identify new operational practices 
that can provide adequate flexibility and 
robustness for the reliable operation of the power 
enhanced forecasting techniques, improved 
ancillary services, more flexible scheduling of 
generation and load dispatch practices, and 
improved management of stocks, among other 
areas. If implemented widely, this recommendation 
will help ensure the reliability of the system in a 
more cost-effective way as it integrates large 
numbers of variable renewables into the system. 
As part of IRENA’s work with CND through the 
technical component of the CECCA initiative, the 
following issues were also identified as possible 
updates to power system operation in Panama:
• Provide training on the impacts of VRE on transient 
and frequency stability analyses, considering the 
impact of VRE. 
• Automate system security analysis tasks using 
power system software analysis to allow closer 
real-time system security checks, with the aim 
of reducing VRE curtailment due to network 
congestion.
• Calculate transmission capacities closer to real 
time for better congestion management and 
consider forecasts for wind and solar production 
in these calculations to minimise curtailment.
DEVELOPING A RENEWABLE ENERGY 
WORKFORCE 
Challenge: A robust workforce is essential for 
the growth of national solar and wind power 
implementation capabilities. An appropriate 
evaluation would allow better understanding 
of the current national workforce in the field of 
renewables, the projected needs for the future, 
and how existing and new education and training 
programmes can meet future needs. 
Recommended Action: Undertake an assessment 
of the skills development needs in Panama’s 
workforce to support efforts towards the 2050 
renewable energy goal.
The assessment would entail, among other actions:
• Conducting a survey of current education 
and training programmes on renewables in 
Panamanian schools and universities.
• Determining the jobs that are currently available 
in the renewable energy sector and what types of 
training employers prefer.
• Identifying the need for new or expanded 
education and training programmes focused on LONG-TERM PLAN FOR ELECTRIC MOBILITY 
AND SECTOR-COUPLING
Challenge: Achieving the alternative scenario of 
the PEN would lead to a 61% reduction in CO2 
emissions from the energy sector, of which the 
majority comes from end-use sectors, led by 
transport. But so far, the deployment rate of lowcarbon technologies in these sectors has been 
slow to achieve significant results, with transport 
in Panama depending 100% on fossil fuels. With 
the newly operating Line 1 of the Panama Metro, 
however, the electrification of transport in the 
country has begun.
To adapt Panama’s energy system to this evolving 
paradigm, a comprehensive plan is needed that 
considers a rapid growth in demand from the 
electrification of transport, including from the 
introduction of expanded metro lines, electric 
passenger vehicles and electric buses. 
At the same time, the generalised subsidy of LPG 
for cooking acts as a disincentive to deployment 
of electric stoves, and thus the shift in residential 
and commercial energy demand from the fossilfuel sector to the electricity sector. Shifting 
this demand profile would provide important 
opportunities to meet increased demand in the 
end-use sectors with VRE generation, aligning 
with the goals of the PEN alternative scenario. 
Recommended Action: Develop a long-term 
urban mobility plan based on the electrification 
of transport (metro system and vehicles), with 
this new demand powered by renewable energy. 
This recommendation can help speed up the use 
of renewable energy in the electricity mix, reduce 
transport problems that currently affect Panama 
(such as high levels of traffic congestion, urban 
planning, and low availability of public transport, 
among others), support the reduction of CO2
emissions, and eliminate the current dependence 
of the sector on fossil fuels. The plan could also 
detail a more active role for electricity distributors 
in promoting electric mobility, possibly through 
schemes to facilitate the installation of electric 
vehicle charging stations.
In the commercial and residential sectors, 
examine the feasibility of a policy that can 
alter or eliminate subsidies for LPG. This should 
be underpinned by a study that details the 
social benefits of reducing LPG subsidies, and 
compares the societal costs of cooking with LPG 
against electric stove use deployed in concert 
with higher shares of renewable power. 
INTERFACE BETWEEN THE NATIONAL AND 
REGIONAL ELECTRICITY MARKETS
Challenge: The Marco Treaty aims to promote 
gradual growth of a competitive regional market, 
the MER, by regional authorities (CDMER, 
CRIE and EOR) in co ordination with national 
authorities. However, there currently exists a lack 
of harmonisation among rules and methodologies, 
such as grid codes, relevant to the efficient 
functioning of the MER. Moreover, institutional 
gaps exist between single jurisdictions and the 
regional market. In this respect, more flexible 
market rules, including those governing the 
allocation of transmission rights, are needed to 
ensure firmness through the multiple resources 
of the MER, instead of the current approach 
which allows limited short-term transactions. 
Recommended Action: Support regional 
efforts to assess and advise on improvements 
to regulatory interface between national and 
regional electricity markets.
While this recommendation is longer term and 
more regional in scale, it can help accelerate 
efforts at the regional level to find solutions to 
energy transfer problems on the MER, specifically 
grid design values and the sub-optimisation of 
regional dispatch that occurs when energy is 
“trapped” on the national markets. This is due 
to transmission constraints, such as the rigid 
dispatch processes. In addition, the great inertia 
made available via the MER helps to optimise 
the operational stocks needed to connect large 
volumes of variable renewables at a minimum 
cost. 
Among the critical issues that need to be further 
analysed are: the definition of firm energy and its 
equivalence to firm capacity at national level; the 
authorisation of transmission rights and of longterm firm contracts; the creation of an intraday 
market to allow adjustment of the volume of 
variable renewables; reviewing the concept of 
interruptible service in firm contracts at the 
national level; and verifying the limited capacity 
of SIEPAC lines in terms of their design capacity.REFERENCES
