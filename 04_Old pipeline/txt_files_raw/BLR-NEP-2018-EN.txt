Project Description 
The Project “Improving Energy Efficiency in Residential Buildings in the Republic of Belarus” (IEERB) in 
Belarus sought to reduce energy consumption (imported fuel) and related GHG emissions with a focus on 
new residential buildings through the introduction of new performance-based building design and 
construction standards with improvements to their implementation and enforcement. The IEERB Project 
was approved with the Government of Belarus’ commitment to introduce legislation promoting new EE 
building standards that are compatible with the EU Energy Efficiency Performance Buildings Directive 
(EEPBD) or 2010/31/EU. With the energy supply of Belarus being highly dependent on imports from 
Russia, and the lack of indigenous energy resources, the country’s focus on energy efficiency in urban 
areas is an important priority for the Government of Belarus. 
The energy consumption for heating of Belarus’ residential sector growing from 40% in 2008 to 45% in 
2015 of all primary energy sources in Belarus is one indicator that little attention has been given to energy 
efficiency in buildings. Typical annual demand for space heating for residential buildings in Belarus is in 
the range of 120-170 kWh/m2
, a value that is not in line with the EEPBD. In early 2014, the residential building stock was close to 250 million m2 including about 170 million m2 of old buildings constructed 
before 1994 according to the old Soviet practices and norms with specific energy consumption (SEC) for 
heating in the range of 150 to 200 kWh/m2/yr. 
The primary legislation driving the IEERB Project is the “Law on Energy Saving” adopted in 1998 but was 
replaced by a new “Law on Energy Saving” (No.239-3 of January 8, 2015) that entered into force in 2015. 
Complementary building energy efficiency regulations relevant to Belarus today to the Law on Energy 
Savings (see Para 18) includes: 
• annual energy consumption for space heating of new buildings to 60 kWh/m2; 
• the “Comprehensive Programme for the Design, Construction and Reconstruction of Energy-Efficient 
Homes in the Republic of Belarus for 2009-2010 and until 2020”, by which systems for heat recovery 
from buildings ventilation air should be installed in all newly constructed buildings by 2020 with the 
aim of reducing energy consumption of all new residential buildings below 40 kWh/m2 by 2020; 
• adjusting electricity and heating tariffs towards higher rates of cost-recovery and improving collection 
rates. Since 2005, the rate of subsidization of heating and electricity tariffs has been increasing in 
Belarus with 2017 heating and electricity tariffs at 21.4% and 80.2% respectively of their real cost (see 
Para 19 and Figure 1). 
Project Results 
Actual outcomes of the IEERB Project are summarized on Table A in comparison with intended outcomes. 
Table A: Comparison of Intended Project Outcomes from the Inception Report to Actual Outcomes 
Intended Outcomes in revised Project
Results Framework of October 2013 
(see Appendix G) 
Actual Outcomes as of March 2017 
Objective: To reduce the energy 
consumption (imported fuel) and related 
GHG emissions with the focus on new 
residential buildings. 
Actual achievement toward objective: Measures to reduce energy 
consumption and GHG emission reductions on new residential 
buildings have been demonstrated on this Project. 
Notwithstanding the new TC-EPB standards for energy efficiency 
of buildings, the timing of adoption of energy efficient heating 
equipment by owners of new buildings is difficult to assess 
considering the uncertainty of when existing heating tariffs will be 
raised from a recovery rate of 21.4% to an estimated 50% that will 
economically justify the installation of such measures. 
Furthermore, the dissemination of positive information of actual 
energy saved from these measures under normal occupancy 
conditions in new buildings would accelerate widespread 
adoption. 
Outcome 1: Strengthened legal and 
regulatory framework and mechanisms to 
enforce the legislation for improving the 
energy efficiency of the building sector.
Actual Outcome 1: Legal and regulatory framework to support the 
enforcement of the Technical Code for Energy Performance of 
Buildings (TC-EPB) has been strengthened.
Outcome 2: Enhanced expert capacity of 
the Belarusian specialists to implement 
new energy efficiency standards and 
construction norms. 
Actual Outcome 2: The capacity of the Belarusian building 
specialists has been enhanced to enforce implementation of new 
energy efficiency standards according to the TC-EPB with an initial 
focus on residential buildings. 
Outcome 3: Demonstrated energy and 
cost-saving potential of new energy 
Actual Outcome 3: Demonstration energy efficient buildings have 
been completed, and will be able to generate normal energyIntended Outcomes in revised Project

consumption data within 18 to 24 months when these buildings 
are under normal occupancy conditions. 
Outcome 4: Documented, disseminated 
and institutionalized project results 
providing a basis for further replication. 
Actual Outcome 4: Project results on supporting legal and 
regulatory framework of the TC-EPB has been institutionalized as 
well as the results of the energy savings from the pilot EE buildings 
(to comply with the Order of July 4, 2017 No.04/26p by the Deputy 
Prime Minister that was initiated by the Project. 
Summary of Conclusions, Recommendations and Lessons 
The IEERB Project has provided excellent support within a 6-year period to improve the enabling 
environment for increased investments into EE residential buildings in Belarus, notwithstanding the 
Project had a very weak Project Results Framework (PRF) which did not convey to the Evaluation Team 
the targets that the Project needed to meet to achieve its overall objective. With strong and stable 
leadership of the IEERB Project from a highly experienced and top Belarussian climate change expert, the 
IEERB PMU was able to facilitate significant achievements for energy efficiency in the building sector in 
Belarus including raised awareness of building energy efficiency amongst all key stakeholders, a draft of a 
Technical Code on Energy Performance of Buildings (TC-EPB) aligned with EU Directive 2010/31/EU ready 
for approval by the Council of Ministers, strengthened capacities of building professionals on all aspects 
of energy performance of buildings, and the completion of 3 energy efficient residential buildings that will 
serve as an excellent resource for generating information on EE buildings, and inform policy 
improvements for the Government of Belarus to the TC-EPB (see Para 103). 
The long-term sustainability of the IEERB Project of reducing energy consumption and GHG emission 
reductions on new residential buildings, however, is difficult to assess. This is considering that existing 
heating tariff rates are too low for economic justification of the installation of energy efficient heating 
equipment in buildings, and the uncertainty of when these heating tariffs will be raised from a 21.4% to a 
50% recovery rate that is considered by most EE experts in Belarus to be a level where such investments 
would be economically feasible. Notwithstanding that TC-EPB will be mandatory likely in 2018, Belarusian 
building developers may be slow in adopting these energy efficiency measures if heating tariffs remain at 
their current levels. In addition, the building sector will continue to need Government support to sustain 
further reductions of energy consumption and GHG emissions from the sector (see Para 105) including: 
• periodic refresher courses for building technicians, operators and owners to ensure minimization 
of fossil fuel consumption for heat generation from district CHPs; 
• refocused efforts implementing energy efficiency measures for the existing building stock which 
is more than 98% of all buildings in Belarus; and 
• efforts to strengthen and institutionalize GHG emission reduction calculations from energy 
efficiency of new buildings as well as retrofitted existing buildings with the involvement of 
MoNREP. Corrective actions for the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the Project: 
Action 1 (to UNDP): To improve design of the future CCM projects including any follow-up “building energy 
efficiency” project, the design should include: 
• a clear logical framework matrix with SMART indicators and measurable targets that can be effectively 
monitored by PMU staff to reflect progress towards global benefits of energy efficiency for the 
building sector; 
• a more detailed Project Results Framework (PRF) using the Theory of Change (ToC) analysis, and with 
targets that are reflected in the project outputs; 
• specific M&E activities that can help project teams focus on specific indicators for monitoring (in an 
improved PRF) which would minimize the workload of the Implementing Partner and the PMU. This 
should include IP and IA access to a functional database of existing and new buildings that can provide 
progress reports on important and relevant metrics such as actual buildings (new and existing) with 
floor area in square metres, and reports from building owners and operators on energy consumption; 
and 
• allocation of sufficient resources for capacity building of building owners and operators to monitor 
energy consumption (see Action 5). 
See Para 107 for details. 
Action 2 (to UNDP): To improve implementation of future projects similar to IEERB, the PRF (strengthened 
through ToC analysis and ROtI) needs to be used as a guide for preparing project work plans. See Para 108 
for details. 
Actions to follow up or reinforce initial benefits from the Project: 
Action 3 (to MoHU with assistance from DEE and UNDP): Continue training workshops in oblast training 
centres to ensure the availability of a critical mass of certified EE building operational personnel to monitor 
and mitigate any trends of deterioration of the energy performance of EE equipment for these buildings 
due to lack of knowledge of proper maintenance practices. See Para 109 for details. 
Action 4 (to MoHU with assistance from DEE and UNDP): Set up a program that continually informs 
occupants of EE buildings on optimizing use of their EE systems for hot water, heating and fresh air 
ventilation systems. See Para 110 for details. 
Action 5 (to MoAC with assistance from DEE and UNDP): Continue training programs to ensure the 
availability of a critical mass of building design personnel to enforce compliance to the TC-EPB. Similar to 
Action 3, oblasts training centres will deliver these training programs for TC-EPB and updates to these 
building designers and technicians that will provide continuous access to the latest best international 
practices for the design of energy efficiency in buildings as mentioned in Para 111. 
Proposals for future directions underlining main objectives of the IEERB Project: 
Action 6 (to DEE and MoHU): Monitor progress of Decree No.1037 of 29.12.2017 on the “Concept of 
Improvement and Development of Housing and Utility Services until 2025” addressing elimination of crosssubsidies and upward adjustment of low heating tariff rate towards 50% and higher that should provide sufficient incentives for a shorter cost recovery period for building developers and investors for EE 
measures in residential buildings. 
Action 7 (to DEE and MoAC): Continue to disseminate actual monitored energy consumption data from 3 
demo buildings to the Government policymakers and investors in line with Deputy Prime Minister’s Order 
No.04/26p of July 4, 2017, with more emphasis on the time when the pilot buildings are fully occupied and 
when the tenants have been in their units for a sufficient time during which their energy consumption 
would be normalized; this could be as long as 18-24 months when all units are occupied although the 
currently monitored data are being provided for decision makers. See Para 113 for details. 
Action 8 (to MoNREP): Provide support to appropriate institutions to help formalize protocols and 
methodologies developed by the Project for reporting GHG emission reductions for EE buildings and 
retrofits that includes support to the RUE Belarusian Research Centre “Ecology” needs to be continued 
after the EOP. See Para 114 for details. 
Action 9 (to DEE): Support future retrofit programs or construction of new EE buildings (supported either 
by GoB or donors) through training of building energy operators and energy managers using experiences 
gained through the Project including training of building energy managers, both state personnel (with 
MoHU) and private individuals and companies (ESCOs) on latest best practices for operating EE systems 
in buildings including introduction of energy management information systems (EMIS) building on UNDP 
experiences in other countries in the region; roundtables on a strengthened ESCO modality in Belarus for 
thermal system installations (if deemed appropriate), upkeep of operational personnel skills that can
result in minimized use of fossil-fuel generated heat and hot water; and training on EE building materials 
as well as targeted research and development on EE building materials that can be domestically produced. 
See Para 115 for details.
Best and worst practices in addressing issues relating to relevance, performance and success: 
Best practice: This UNDP project has been well-managed due to the recruitment of a well-qualified project 
manager with good management skills as well as strong knowledge and technical skill in the subject 
matter. See Para 116 for details. 
Scope for improved practice: Many country offices including Belarus need assistance in the preparation of 
ProDocs, most notably the Project Results Framework which needs to be focused with insertion of SMART 
indicators that directly contribute to an intended outcome. The PRF could be further strengthened 
through adoption of ToC and ROtI analyses with the assistance of personnel from Regional Centers.

1. This report summarizes the findings of the Terminal Evaluation Mission conducted during the 12-27 
February 2018 period for the GEF-financed Project entitled: “Improving Energy Efficiency in 
Residential Buildings in the Republic of Belarus” (herein referred to as the “IEERB Project” or the 
“Project”) where UNDP received a US$ 4.50 million grant from the Global Environmental Facility 
(GEF). 
2. The IEERB Project has the objective of reducing the energy consumption (imported fuel) and related 
GHG emissions with the focus on new residential buildings by introducing new performance based 
building design and construction standards with related energy certification schemes and by 
ensuring their effective implementation and enforcement. The IEERB Project was approved along 
with the commitment of the Government of Belarus to introduce legislation to promote new EE 
building standards that are compatible with the EU Energy Efficiency Performance Buildings Directive 
(EEPBD) or 2010/31/EU. New legislation was intent on reducing energy consumption of new 
buildings by: 
• 70% in comparison with existing building stock of Belarus constructed before 1993; and 
• 40% when comparing buildings constructed in accordance to current construction norms and 
thermal standards. 
3. The Project was designed to achieve this objective by strengthening of the legal and regulatory 
framework, training of local experts and other key stakeholders to implement buildings compliant 
with the new directives, construction of three EE demo buildings to test and gain practical experience 
on implementing energy efficient buildings, and related outreach and dissemination of the lesson 
learnt. This terminal evaluation covers these activities managed by UNDP Belarus. 
1.1 Purpose of the Evaluation 
4. The Terminal Evaluation (TE) for the IEERB Project was to evaluate the progress towards the 
attainment of global environmental objectives, project objectives and outcomes, capture lessons 
learned and suggest recommendations on major improvements. The TE was to serve as an agent of 
change and play a critical role in supporting accountability. As such, this TE serves to: 
• promote accountability and transparency, and to assess and disclose levels of Project 
accomplishments; 
• synthesize lessons that may help improve the selection, design and implementation of future 
GEF activities; 
• provide feedback on issues that are recurrent across the portfolio and need attention, and on 
improvements regarding previously identified issues; and 
• contribute to the GEF Evaluation Office databases for aggregation, analysis and reporting on 
effectiveness of GEF operations in achieving global environmental benefits and on the quality of 
monitoring and evaluation across the GEF system. 
5. Outputs from this TE will provide an outlook and guidance in charting future directions on sustaining 
current efforts by UNDP, the Government of Belarus, their donor partners, to sustain the capacities of relevant Belarusian government institutions to promote and regulate improved energy efficiency 
in the building sector throughout Belarus. 
1.2 Scope and Methodology 
6. The scope of the TE for the IEERB Project was to include all activities funded by GEF and activities 
from parallel co-financing. The Terms of Reference (ToRs) for the TE are contained in Appendix A. 
Key issues addressed on this TE include: 
• To what extent have Project activities led to improved new legislation including the adoption of 
minimum building energy performance standards (MBEPs)? This would involve the Project’s 
contribution to the Technical Code on "Energy Efficiency of Buildings", a regulatory enactment 
that contains, inter alia, the MBEP requirements, corresponding provisions for energy 
certification and compliance checking systems and energy audit; 
• To what extent have Project activities led to the enhancement of knowledge of building energy 
efficiency issues in Belarus? This involves a wide range of training beneficiaries including building 
and energy efficiency practitioners within the Government of Belarus (Department of Energy 
Efficiency or DEE), Ministry of Architecture and Construction (MoAC), Ministry of Natural 
Resources and Environmental Protection (MoNREP), state and private construction companies, 
academia and private consultants; 
• To what extent have Project activities led to the completion of demonstration of energy efficient 
measures that comply with new energy efficiency standards developed by the Project?; 
• Has the Project developed any new tools to monitor compliance with higher energy efficient 
standards for new buildings, and to what extent are they being used to assist the Government 
of Belarus achieve a higher rate of compliance with improved energy efficiency standards for 
buildings, both new buildings and existing buildings? 
7. Outputs from this TE provides an outlook and guidance in charting future directions on sustaining 
current efforts by UNDP and the Government of Belarus on strengthening the legal and regulatory 
framework for energy efficiency of building stock in Belarus, and improving the knowledge base of 
energy efficiency issues in buildings amongst public, private and academia stakeholders involved 
with building energy efficiency in Belarus. In addition, the TE will assess the value of the pilot projects 
implemented and the effectiveness of the mechanisms for disseminating information of these pilots. 
8. The methodology adopted for this evaluation includes: 
• Review of project documentation (i.e. APR/PIRs, meeting minutes of Project Steering Committee 
or multipartite meetings) and pertinent background information; 
• Interviews with key Project personnel including the current Project Manager, technical advisors 
(domestic and international), and Project developers; 
• Interviews with relevant stakeholders including other government agencies, engineering and 
architectural professionals and academic institutions; and 
• Field visits to selected Project’s pilot sites and interviews with beneficiaries. 
A detailed itinerary of the Mission is shown in Appendix B. A full list of people interviewed and 
documents reviewed are given in Appendix C and Appendix D respectively. The Evaluation Mission 
for the UNDP-GEF Project was comprised of one lead international expert and one national expert. 9. The Project was evaluated for overall results in the context of: 
 
• Relevance – the extent to which the outcome is suited to local and national development 
priorities and organizational policies, including changes over time; 
• Effectiveness – the extent to which an objective was achieved or how likely it is to be achieved; 
• Efficiency – the extent to which results were delivered with the least costly resources possible; 
and 
• Sustainability - The likely ability of an intervention to continue to deliver benefits for an extended 
period of time after completion. 
10. All possible efforts have been made to minimize the limitations of this independent evaluation. There 
were 15 days spent by the mission to meet all relevant stakeholders in Minsk, along with site visits 
to all demonstration buildings completed by the Project in Minsk, Mahilioŭ and Hrodna. In addition, 
the evaluation team had time to collect and triangulate as much information as possible with followup e-mails between the Evaluation Team and the Project after the terminal evaluation mission to fill 
in information gaps.

 2. PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT 
2.1 Project Start and Duration 
14. The “Improving Energy Efficiency in Residential Buildings” Project officially commenced 
implementation on 31 July 2012, the date when the Belarusian government signature for the Project 
document (ProDoc) was obtained. The Project duration originally was planned for 5 years beginning 
in January 2012 (the formal start date as per the ProDoc) and ending in December 2016. In December 
2014, the Mid-Term evaluation recommended that an extension for the Project should be considered 
for another 12 months to complete the demonstration buildings and allow sufficient time for 
monitoring of energy consumption. Currently, the final terminal date of the IEERB Project is 30 June 
2018. 
2.2 Problems that IEERB Project Sought to Address 
15. The IEERB ProDoc provides details on the problems that the Project sought to address. The price and 
other delivery terms of the gas and oil imported from Russia and its transit to other European 
countries through Belarus have been subject to several disputes between the Governments of 
Belarus and Russia since 2004. The previous low price paid by Belarus for the Russian gas has been 
gradually increasing, thereby providing a higher impetus also for different energy efficiency 
measures. This has led to the country’s issues related to increased energy security and greater 
energy independence remaining high on the Government agenda. 
16. The energy supply in Belarus is highly dependent on imports, mainly from Russia. Apart from small 
deposits of natural gas, oil, peat and some hydro resources as well as the forests covering close to 
40% of the country, there are no significant other indigenous energy resources available. In 2015, 
the imports covered close to 88% of the total primary energy use for heating, and close to 98% for 
electricity generation4
. With more than 75% of Belarus’s 9.5 million citizens living in urban areas, the 
country’s focus on energy efficiency in urban areas is an important priority for the Government of 
Belarus. 
17. As a percentage of all primary energy resources available in Belarus, energy consumption for 
residential sector heating in Belarus has grown from 40% in 2008 to 45% in 2015, while electricity 
consumption in this sector has only grown from 21% in 2008 to 22.5% in 2015. This is one indicator 
that little attention has been given to energy efficiency in buildings resulting in typical annual 
demand for space heating of about 120-170 kWh/m2
, a value that is not in line with EU Directives. In 
early 2014, the residential building stock was close to 250 million m2 including about 170 million m2
of old buildings constructed before 1994 according to the old Soviet practices and norms with specific 
energy consumption (SEC) for heating in the range of 150 to 200 kWh/m2/yr. 
18. Since 1993, the Government of Belarus has been seeking improvements to specific consumption of 
heat energy: 
• In 1993, a new national standard “Construction Heat Engineering” was adopted, enhancing the 
requirements for the insulation of the building envelope to annual space-heating demand of 86-
 
4
 IEA Energy Statistics 2015 available on: 
https://www.iea.org/statistics/statisticssearch/report/?year=2015&country=BELARUS&product=ElectricityandHeat 91 kWh/m2 for buildings of 9 floors or higher and to 89-105 kWh/m2 for a typical 4-5 storey 
building. While comparable to similar norms in Russia and Ukraine, these standards were not in 
line with EU countries; 
• The “Law on Architecture, Urban Planning and Construction Activities in the Republic of Belarus" 
(2004, amended in 2009), set the framework for relations between governmental agencies, 
private organizations and individuals engaged in architecture, urban planning and construction 
activities. This is relevant to the IEERB Project in the context of the institutions responsible for 
enforcing compliance with technical regulations, contracts, as well as non-contractual 
obligations; 
• The “Regulation on Preparation and Issuance of Construction Permits” (2007, amended in 2010) 
established procedures for obtaining permits for construction, reconstruction, restoration and 
repair of buildings. The process would include obtaining the required permits and approvals for 
building retrofits and new building permits that would need to comply with any new regulations 
and standards on building heating energy consumption; 
• The installation of heat meters and automatic regulation of heating in residential and public 
buildings has been mandatory since 2007; 
• The “Law on Energy Saving” adopted in 1998 but was replaced by a new “Law on Energy Saving” 
(No.239-3 of January 8, 2015) that entered into force in 2015. Complementary building energy 
efficiency regulations around the current Law on Energy Savings that are relevant to the energy 
situation in Belarus today, specifically the building energy efficiency, includes: 
o New thermal standards introduced in 2010 to reduce annual energy consumption for space 
heating of new buildings to 60 kWh/m2
. At this time, many EU countries were developing 
new regulations reducing space-heating energy consumption to less than 30 kWh/m2/yr 
with the best achieved engineering solutions leading to about 15 kWh/m2/yr; 
o The “Comprehensive Programme for the Design, Construction and Reconstruction of 
Energy-Efficient Homes in the Republic of Belarus for 2009-2010 and until 2020”, by which 
systems for heat recovery from buildings ventilation air should be installed in all newly 
constructed buildings by 2020. This is in accordance with the stated goal of the energy 
efficiency program to reduce space-heating energy consumption of all new residential 
buildings below 40 kWh/m2
 by 2020; 
o Electricity and heating tariffs with the intention of: 
 increasing tariffs to cost-recovery levels (at the Belenergo level); 
 reducing cross-subsidies between different consumer groups; and 
 improving payment discipline to improve the collection rate and eliminate barter. 
• MoAC with support of the State Standardization Committee’s DEE implemented a couple of pilot 
projects (prior to the commencement of IEERB) to demonstrate that there is still large energy 
savings potential while introducing some other state-of-the-art techniques into building 
construction practice. 
19. As of October 2010, the district heating tariffs in Belarus were about €0.008 euro cents per kWh, 
roughly 37% of the real tariff costs, and €0.0042 per kWh for electricity, roughly 59% of the real 
electricity tariff. As of 2017, the heating tariff has decreased to 21.4%, an increase in the level of the 
electricity tariff now at 80% of the real cost. Figure 1 provides an overview of heating and electricity 
tariffs between 2005 and 2017 as a percentage of their real cost. These highly regressive subsidies 
only add costs to business, and create significant fiscal risks and macroeconomic vulnerabilities. 
Studies indicate that negative social impact is manageable if a tariff increase is accompanied by 
countervailing measures to compensate for the loss of purchasing power, in particular of the poor, 
through targeted social assistance and energy efficiency programs. While the goal of the Government is to reduce the subsidies to zero5, the further subsidization resulted from unforeseen 
circumstances including the 2011-2016 devaluation of the Russian rouble, and the resulting increase 
of heating costs to the population. Notwithstanding, the energy efficiency of buildings is high on the 
GoB’s development agenda. 
Figure 1: Belarus Electricity and Heating Tariffs as a % of Real Cost6
20. In 2010, the Government also made projections on an increase of more than 120 million m2
 of new 
residential buildings during the period of 2012-2026. Along with the aforementioned legislation for 
building energy efficiency in Para 18, MoAC set an objective and adopted a program to move towards 
mass construction of energy efficient buildings in Belarus. Despite the availability of technical skills, 
appropriate building materials and equipment as well as basic engineering capacity in Belarus to 
implement such a program, barriers to the full adoption of the program remained including: 
• the prevalence of traditional approaches to building design within the engineering and 
architectural professions in Belarus. As such, design of the energy performance of a building is 
undertaken without a holistic view of the energy performance of the entire building; 
• the absence of a legal and regulatory framework that is less prescriptive in its approach to energy 
efficiency in buildings, and more encouraging towards minimum energy performance standards 
for the entire building; 
 
5
 Decision № 1180 of the Council of Ministers of Belarus dated August 9, 2010 on “Approval of the development strategy of the 
energy potential of the Republic of Belarus” which calls for the phase out of all energy tariff subsidies including those for natural 
gas used for food preparation by 2011, for electricity by 2013 and for district heating by 2014.

id=1065• a lack of comprehensive energy audits on buildings in Belarus;
• lack of guidance in the context of technical details of energy efficient equipment, and proper 
methods of their installation; and 
• lack of financial incentives to catalyze the construction of energy efficient buildings. 
The IEERB Project seeks to address the lowering of these barriers and catalyze instruction of energy 
efficient buildings in the residential sector in Belarus. 
2.3 Development Objective of IEERB Project 
21. The objective of the IEERB Project was to “reduce the energy consumption (imported fuel) and 
related GHG emissions with the focus on new residential buildings”. This objective was to be 
achieved through the meeting of the targets of 80 new buildings (roughly 10% of all new buildings in 
Belarus) that have in their design an SEC of 60 kWh/m2/yr for space heating and hot water and a 
resulting lifetime GHG emission reduction target of 220,000 tonnes CO2. These are defined in the 
Project Results Framework (PRF) for the IEERB Project that was amended and approved in June 2013. 
This PRF is contained in Appendix G. 
2.4 Baseline Indicators Established 
22. The baseline value for all these indicators of the IEERB Project can be found in the approved PRF in 
Appendix G. 
2.5 Main Stakeholders 
23. The formulation and implementation of energy saving policies in Belarus was started in 1993 
together with the establishment of an inter-institutional body, the State Committee for Energy 
Efficiency and Energy Control of Belarus. This entity was transformed in 2001 to the Committee on 
Energy Efficiency under the Council of Ministers and in 2006 to the Department on Energy Efficiency 
(DEE) under the State Committee on Standardization. The ground level implementation of energy 
saving policies is done through the development and implementation of national, regional and 
sectoral energy efficiency programs. DEE, the Ministry of Economy (MoE) and other national 
stakeholders are setting national targets for energy conservation, which are further transformed to 
mandatory tasks to be implemented by different line ministries, other governmental agencies and 
state-owned enterprises. 
24. A listing of groupings of stakeholders of interest to the Evaluation includes: 
• Stakeholders within the Government of Belarus including those involved with the Project in the 
DEE, MoAC and MoE, notably those involved with the setting of energy efficiency standards and 
policies (including those advocating the removal of fuel subsidies), enforcement of these 
standards and policies, and those with oversight on financial mechanism programs (such as 
interest rate subsidies) to catalyze interest in energy efficient buildings; 
• Building and energy efficiency practitioners within state construction companies, private 
engineering firms and academia, notably those who have been involved with engineering and 
design of buildings that comply with the policies and standards, and those involved with construction inspection of new buildings the need to comply with new energy efficient 
standards and policies; 
• Energy auditors who have developed their skills in preparing reports on building energy 
consumption with a focus on primary energy consumed for HVAC and hot water on new and 
retrofitted buildings; 
• Building owners and managers on their satisfaction in undertaking EE measures for their 
residential buildings; and 
• Building operators whose capacities to manage and minimize building energy consumption are 
important towards maximizing GHG emission reductions from the building sector. 
25. A complete listing of stakeholders who have participated on the IEERB Project is provided in Section 
3.2.2 (Paras 46-47). 
2.6 Expected Results 
26. To achieve the specific IEERB objective to “reduce the energy consumption (imported fuel) and 
related GHG emissions with the focus on new residential buildings”, the IEERB Project was designed 
with the following expected Project outcomes: 
• Outcome 1: Strengthened legal and regulatory framework and mechanisms to enforce the 
legislation for improving the energy efficiency of the building sector; 
• Outcome 2: Enhanced expert capacity of the Belarusian specialists to implement new energy 
efficiency standards and construction norms; 
• Outcome 3: Implementation of demonstration projects for energy efficient buildings; 
• Outcome 4: Documented, disseminated and institutionalized project results providing a basis 
for further replication. 3. FINDINGS 
3.1 Project Design and Formulation 
27. Design of the IEERB Project was first conceived in 2010 after Belarus had introduced new thermal 
standards for buildings in support of the Law on Energy Savings of 1998. The IEERB ProDoc packaged 
these designs into a GEF climate change mitigation project that would support the country’s efforts 
to lower the barriers to the full adoption in Belarus of a program to build energy efficient buildings 
as described in Para 20. 
28. The strategy of the IEERB Project to lower these barriers included implementing Project activities 
divided into 4 components, the outcomes of which are described in Para 26. However, prior to 
presenting Project results, an analysis of the IEERB Project design is presented in this section. 
3.1.1 Analysis of Project Results Framework 
29. The Project Results Framework (PRF) for the IEERB Project was slightly revised after the Inception 
Phase workshop of June 2013 and the MTR of December 2014 in consideration of the 9-month delay 
to start-up the IEERB Project (see Para 42 for details). The PRF only contains 2 objective level 
indicators and 6 indicators for 4 outcomes. In the context of best practices for preparing PRF’s for 
GEF projects, the wording of the indicators and targets are poorly formulated and do not meet 
SMART criteria7. Some specific comments on the 2013 PRF includes: 
• 5 of the outcome indicators not being specific and measurable. This includes indicators such 
as “demonstrated capacity” and the “status” of regulatory documents and demonstration 
projects, both of which are not specific or measurable for the purposes of monitoring the 
progress of the Project; 
• indicator descriptors should be a short description reflecting the numerical value of the target; 
• the EOP target should be just a number with a footnote to describe the conditions of meeting 
that target (such as an indicator “tonnes CO2 emissions reductions by the EOP” and a target of 
“220,000” with a footnote to indicate “these are lifetime CO2 emission reductions for which 
construction has started or which have adopted into their design new energy efficiency 
elements that reduce energy consumption for heating and hot water in residential buildings”); 
• in instances where the “status” needs to be measured (such as in Outcome 1 on the status of 
national laws or Outcome 3 on this status of demonstration projects), the PRF should have 
entered output level targets such as Output 1.2 with an indicator of number of completed 
energy audits and the target of 50, or Output 3.3 with an indicator of number of demonstration 
buildings covered in monitoring reports with a target of 3. 
While this Evaluation points out the shortcomings of this PRF that may add to the difficulties of 
properly evaluating progress of most GEF projects, the PMU for the IEERB Project was still able to 
effectively monitor progress of the IEERB Project towards its intended objective, outcomes and 
outputs. 
30. The GHG emission reductions target of the IEERB Project is 220,000 tonnes CO2 that are lifetime 
emission reductions generated mainly from more than 80 EE new residential buildings which comply 
 
7
Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-bound to Technical Code “Energy Efficiency of Buildings” which is actually the Technical Code for Energy 
Performance of Buildings (TC-EPB). This was to be calculated by taking the baseline annual specific 
energy consumption (SEC) for space heating demand from the average of 60 kWh/m2 (as adopted in 
2010) to 20 kWh/m2 and the annual heat demand for sanitary hot water from the current average of 
65 kWh/m2
 similarly to 40 kWh/m2. The Ministry of Architecture and Construction (MoAC) maintain 
a database of buildings that are approved for construction and compliance with EEB Technical Code, 
complete with the actual SEC values of the new building and the building area in m2
. GHG emission 
reductions can then be calculated by applying an average energy emissions factor in Belarus 
(consisting of composite electricity and heat factors). Table 1 provides a sample calculation from the 
IEERB ProDoc of the direct GHG reduction impact with the target of 65 kWh/m2/yr savings in final 
energy use compared to similar constructed buildings in accordance with the construction norms in 
force in 2012. This analysis would also be applicable to the detailed design of the 3 demo buildings 
that were implemented on this Project as well as other buildings that are approved for construction 
and in compliance to the TC-EPB. 
Table 1: Summary of the assumptions and results from calculating the direct (lifetime) GHG reduction 
impact of the Project
Estimated total demonstration project floor area 36,000 m2
Average annual savings in space heating demand 40 kWh/m2/yr
Average annual savings in the use of heat for sanitary hot water preparation 25 kWh/m2/yr
Calculation period for energy savings in space heating 30 years
Calculation period for energy savings in sanitary hot water preparation 15 years
Total energy savings over the calculation period 1,575 kWh/m2
Average emission factor for final energy use 0.216 kgCO2/kWh
Demo project CO2 reduction over the calculation period 12.2 kt CO2eq
31. The objective level target in the PRF of 220 ktCO2eq for GHG emission reductions would appear to be 
reasonable based on 80 buildings adopting the energy efficiency norms for buildings of the EEB 
Technical Code, for which the design or construction has started during the project implementation. 
With the enforcement system in place with MoAC approving project designs that are in compliance 
with the TC-EPB, the PMU will be reliant on reporting from the implementing partner, DEE, of 
buildings that have received these design and construction approvals. The target of 80 buildings 
assumes approximately 800,000 m2
 of floor area for each of the 80 buildings. 
3.1.2 Risks and Assumptions 
32. A number of assumptions were identified in the PRF from 2012 as well as the revised PRF in June 
2013 and Dec 2014 as keys to the achievement of IEERB Project objectives. This included: 
• suggested EE measures are adopted by design institutes and construction companies into the 
design of new buildings; 
• continued commitment of the Government of Belarus to proceed with suggested legislation; 
• demonstration projects adding value to new approaches for targeted building practitioners; 
• the assumption that the design of the demonstration buildings would be completed in the first 
18 months of IEERB, and construction would be completed at the end of Year 3. 33. The ProDoc also identified 9 risks in a draft risk log. Many of the risks identified in the ProDoc’s Annex 
7-1 represent the barriers to be removed by the Project. One exception is Risk #1 which identifies 
local energy pricing policies not being supportive of energy efficiency investments. While this risk 
was initially rated as relatively low, the devaluation of the Russian ruble between 2012 and 2015 only 
made the price of natural gas and heating more costly for Belarusian citizens, making it more difficult 
for the Government of Belarus to eliminate heating subsidies (that are mentioned in Paras 18 and 
19). This risk would have been difficult to have predict by IEERB Project designers. 
3.1.3 Lessons from Other Relevant Projects Incorporated into IEERB Project Design 
34. The ProDoc of the IEERB Project does not list any other relevant Projects into its design. 
 
3.1.4 Planned Stakeholder Participation 
35. One of the primary purposes of IEERB Project was to increase the knowledge and build the capacity 
of key stakeholders8
 while concurrently strengthening the legal and regulatory framework to support 
the Law on Energy Savings, and defining minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) for energy 
efficiency in buildings in line with best international practice. In addition, the IEERB Project also 
planned stronger engagement of stakeholders through supporting implementation of 
demonstration energy efficient buildings and disseminating positive information of these EE 
buildings to raise the confidence of targeted stakeholders. 
36. The stakeholder involvement approach in the IEERB ProDoc involves a wide spectrum of stakeholders 
including: 
 
• the Government of Belarus including the implementing partner, DEE (under the State Committee 
on Standardization of the Council of Ministers), the Ministry of Architecture and Construction, 
and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection; 
• state enterprises such as Stroytechnorm and Institute of Housing (NIPTIS) who are responsible 
for formulating policies; 
• municipal and private engineering and construction enterprises who are responsible for design 
and construction of energy efficiency in buildings; 
• various universities and educational institutes with building construction faculties to build the 
capacity of engineers and technicians involved in energy efficiency in building projects 
throughout Belarus. 
In reviewing the intended outcomes of the IEERB Project, this level of stakeholder involvement 
appears sound. 
3.1.5 Replication Approach 
37. The Project design envisaged a replication approach by improving and adopting mandatory minimum 
energy performance standards (MEPS) in the process for approvals of new building construction. 
Replication would be bolstered through new building designs needing to comply with these 
mandatory MEPS, increased knowledge of all building practitioners to implement energy efficient 
 
8
 Government personnel, building owners, engineers and architects of state and private construction companies, and building 
practitioners from private firms and academia. designs in residential buildings, and increased confidence of building practitioners to implement 
energy efficient residential buildings through examples set in completed demonstration EE buildings. 
3.1.6 UNDP Comparative Advantage 
38. UNDPs comparative advantage to other donor agencies is its focus on policy-based and cross-sectoral 
approaches as well as building local capacities through effective collaboration with a wide range of 
local stakeholders, ranging from the public and private sectors to technical experts, civil society and 
grassroots level organizations. These approaches are strongly applicable on energy efficiency 
projects such as this IEERB Project. In particular, UNDP has carried out over 15 projects related to 
energy efficiency in buildings in the Europe & CIS region over the past 10 years. Given UNDP’s long 
track record on a wide variety of projects within the energy sector, UNDP is suited as an 
implementing agency for this Project. 
 
3.1.7 Linkages between IEERB Project and Other Interventions within the Sector 
39. The IEERB Project was intended to be linked with several completed energy sector related projects 
by the Government of Belarus with their donor partners including: 
• The UNDP/GEF project “Biomass Energy for Heating and Hot Water Supply” with an objective 
to reduce GHG emissions of Belarus by removing barriers to economically feasible wood and 
wood waste utilization for heat and hot water supply. The project was completed in 2008 with a 
satisfactory rating; 
• UNDP/GEF project “Removing the Barriers to Improving Energy Efficiency in the State Sector 
of Belarus” with an objective to attract investments in the implementation of energy efficiency 
activities in the state sector. The project was completed in 2011 with a satisfactory rating; 
• World Bank Social Infrastructure Retrofitting Project was approved in 2001. The project aims 
to improve the social sector facilities with particular emphasis on reducing energy consumption. 
The project has two main components. The first component supports investment in physical 
infrastructure. Energy retrofitting measures in schools and medical facilities include building 
envelope and heating system improvements as well as conversion or replacement of individual 
autonomous boilers. Rehabilitation of limited parts of the district heating network is also 
included, when deemed as necessary, to capture savings at the heat production source. Project 
was completed in 2010 with a satisfactory rating; 
• World Bank Energy Efficiency Project was approved in May 2009. The objective of the project is 
to improve energy efficiency in heat and power generation in selected towns of Belarus. The 
project has three components: The first component is the conversion of existing heat-only-boiler 
plants to combined heat and power plants at six sites. The Project has had a satisfactory 
completion in December 2017. 
3.1.8 Management Arrangements 
40. The national implementing partner of the IEERB Project is the Department of Energy Efficiency (DEE) 
under the State Committee on Standardization of Belarus. The IEERB Project was to be implemented 
in accordance with UNDPs National Implementation Modality (now referred to as National Execution 
or NEX modality). NEX modality tasks DEE with responsibility for certifying work plans and approved 
budgets, reporting on procurement, coordinating and tracking co-financing, terms of reference for contractors and tender documentation, and chairing the Project Steering Committee (PSC). The Chair 
of the PSC was to be the National Project Director (NPD) from DEE.
41. In the ProDoc, UNDP provides Project implementation support to DEE by managing the budget and 
project expenditures, contracting project personnel, executing actions for procurement, and 
implementing the day-to-day management and monitoring of the project operations. An 
organogram of the IEERB Project implementation arrangements is provided on Figure 2.

2012 marking the official commencement of the IEEERB Project; 
• The Project Management Unit (PMU) for the IEERB Project was only established in December 
2012. This coincided with the hiring of the first and only National Project Manager for the IEERB 
Project (17 December 2012), nearly 11 months after the formal start of IEERB according to the 
ProDoc and 5 months after its official registration by the Belarusian Government on Aug 10, 
2012; 
• The Project’s Inception Workshop was conducted in June 2013 (three months later than 
anticipated) due to long-lasting negotiations between the PMU, DEE and the Ministry of Natural 
Resources and Environmental Protection (MoNREP) to verify and secure MoNREP's co-financing 
commitments; 
• In November 2013, MoNREP formally withdrew from its co-financing commitments on the IEERB 
Project; 
• A Mid Term Review (MTR) for the IEERB Project was conducted during the September-December 
2014 period; 
• Support was provided to selected policymakers and building development practitioners for study 
tours to Austria, Czech Republic, United Kingdom and Germany in 2013-2015; 
• During 2014 and 2015, the Project initiated and helped organize a “Technical Committee” to lead 
development of the Technical Code for Energy Performance of Buildings along with several 
interrelated standards in support of the TC-EPB’s key provisions. This subsequently led to a draft 
of the TC-EPB that was approved by the State Standardization Committee (GosStandard) on 21 
December 2015, and a recommendation by the GosStandard to the Council of Ministers for full 
adoption; 
• Studies into the construction and designs of the 3 demonstration buildings commenced during 
2014 and 2015; 
• Since June-July 2016, the Project has been sharing its experiences with UNDP-GEF sister projects 
in building energy efficiency in Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan; 
• Approval of an 18-month extension on 10 November 2016 from 31 December 2017 to 30 June 
2018; 
• By December 2016, demonstration buildings in Mahilioŭ and Minsk were completed; 
• By May 2017, demonstration building in Hrodna was completed; 
• By early 2016, the Belarusian National Technical University (BNTU) adopted educational 
materials, tutorials and reference books on building energy efficiency developed by the IEERB 
Project into their Construction Faculty curriculum; 
• During 2013-2017, the Project organized and held more than 100 different informational 
campaigns (international and national conferences, seminars, roundtables, trainings, pressconferences, etc.). 
• Since June 2017, extensive training campaigns started both for residents of the pilot buildings 
and specialists from the housing and utility companies responsible for operation and 
maintenance of the buildings. 
3.2.1 Adaptive Management 
43. Adaptive management is discussed in GEF terminal evaluations to gauge performance of project 
personnel to adapt to changing regulatory and environmental conditions, common occurrences that 
afflict the majority of GEF projects. Without adaptive management, GEF investments would not be effective in achieving their intended outcomes, outputs and targets. Examples of adaptive 
management during implementation of the 5.75-year duration of the IEERB to March 2018 included: 
• The PMU needing to accelerate performance of all activities considering the delay from July 2012 
to May 2013 to put in place the PMU and to setup activities and consultants for the identification 
of appropriate consultants and stakeholders for the design and construction of 3 energy efficient 
pilot buildings to be done under Component 3. Under a compressed timeframe of less than 2 
years, the PMU needed to engage local consultants, organize and conduct the necessary training 
workshops and seminars required to catalyze interest in energy efficiency in buildings, and 
perform the necessary energy audits to show the opportunities for energy savings that could be 
realized under Component 3 activities; 
• Actions required to identify co-financing with the withdrawal of the Ministry of Natural 
Resources and Environmental Protection co-financing for a pilot building as of 8 November 2013. 
Despite the approval of the PSC in April 2014 for the construction of 3 pilot buildings in Hrodna, 
Minsk and Mahilioŭ, this withdrawal of co-financing affected negotiations with “RUE Mahilioŭ 
UKS”, a building construction owner that did not yet have a legally binding contract with a 
building, raising the risk of delays to the completion date of the IEERB Project. The PMU 
recommended DEE to consider directly contracting NIPTIS, the developer of pilot buildings in 
Grodno and Minsk. This recommendation was accepted in December 2013 and contributed to 
reducing the risk of delay and avoid the long international tendering process; 
• Inclusion of training of building operators and residents in energy efficient buildings which was 
not originally envisioned in the ProDoc. Para 77 has more details; 
• The inclusion of the Ministry of Housing and Utilities (MoHU) into the list of Project’s key 
stakeholders that was initiated by PMU through a special PSC meeting and a memorandum duly 
registered by the Government. Their inclusion, which was not envisioned in the ProDoc, was 
important since MoHU’s entities have responsibilities over a number of public housing projects 
as well as the operation of residential buildings. Besides, the MoHU cooperates with Oblast 
Executive Committees and the Ministry of Economy as to the rationale and setting of heating 
tariffs. With the emergence of heating tariffs not being amended towards full cost recovery 
during IEERB implementation, inclusion of MoHU has led to Project discussions on the 
importance of mitigating this significant risk. 
• The inclusion of MoHU also opened doors for a wider training campaign that addressed 
operation of energy efficient buildings and the procurement, installation and handover of all 
necessary training models, samples, and simulators to the Housing & Utility Training Centers; 
• Development of a communications strategy by the Project’s communication specialist to more 
effectively disseminate the positive results of IEERB activities. The strategy provided 
identification of target audiences of the strategy including technical, the public sector, EE 
building tenants and the general public, and appropriate communications to each target group 
with the assistance of IEERB technical staff and its experts;
• Adjustments resulting from the IEERB Mid-Term Review (MTR) of December 2014. The PMU 
provided a Management Response to the MTR, a summary of which is provided on Table 2. In 
general, the PMU implemented these recommendations to the extent that they were feasible 
within the time frame of the Project including the 18-month extension. 
44. In conclusion, UNDP’s efforts to adaptively manage this Project were sincere and satisfactory in 
consideration of the successful outcomes of this Project. Table 2: Management Response of IEERB PMU to MTR Recommendations 
Recommendation Management Response of April 
2015 
Evaluation Comment 
Because of the delayed start of 
the implementation of the 
project the MTE recommends 
drafting a realistic time planning 
Project team to draft a realistic 
time-frame for project 
implementation in close 
consultations with all the key 
national partners 
The PMU did complete this keeping 
in mind the critical path of the IEERB 
Project was the implementation of EE 
demonstration buildings of Outcome 
3. 
Because of the delayed start of 
the implementation of the 
project the MTE recommends to 
prolong the project for 18 
months 
Consider a possibility for project 
no-cost extension 
No-cost extension was successfully 
obtained. 
The MTE recommends paying 
more attention to institutional 
capacity building of the public 
authorities to ensure effective 
enforcement of this regulatory 
framework 
The project team should work 
closely with national counterparts, 
particularly with the Energy 
Efficiency Department and the 
Ministry of Architecture and 
Construction to identify capacity 
building needs and then develop a 
capacity building plan and follow it. 
There was an increase in the number 
of study tours to allow personnel 
from DEE and MoAC to observe best 
international practices for 
implementing EE buildings. 
The MTE recommends paying 
more attention in the project to 
energy management. 
Consideration could be given to 
transferring the highly successful 
energy management information 
system (EMIS) developed by 
UNDP in Croatia to Belarus 
Agree. The project should consider 
including activities addressing 
energy management issues into the 
project scope (if it is feasible), 
along with considering a possibility 
of obtaining the EMIS developed by 
UNDP in Croatia and transferring it 
to Belarus 
PMU were not able to implement this 
recommendation due to time 
constraints and late completion of 
the demonstration buildings. There 
remains, however, continued interest 
in EMIS with a recommendation 
made for its use in monitoring energy 
consumption in buildings in Belarus. 
Although there is no reason to 
doubt the accuracy of financial 
reporting by the PMU it would be 
advisable to have an annual or at 
least bi-annual financial audit of 
the project 
UNDP actions with respect to 
auditing its projects are governed 
by the respective corporate rules 
and procedures. It should be noted 
that the approved Project 
Document provides budget for 
project financial auditing. A 
possibility and necessity to conduct 
an external mid-term project audit 
should be discusses internally 
The ProDoc in its Article 5, 
“Monitoring Framework & 
Evaluation” refers to the Inception 
Stage, which should, inter alia, 
address some relevant issues as 
follows: “… d) Discuss financial 
reporting … and arrangements for 
annual audit.” The discussion held 
under the Inception Seminar’s 
agenda item “Suggestions for a 
respective adjustment of Project’s 
activities based on the inception 
stage results” did not concern this 
issue, for there was the general 
opinion on the fact that the Project 
was not of pure NIM modality. In line 
with this decision, neither the 2013 
AWP nor future AWPs included such 
an audit. The MTE Report noticed 
this and recommended to review the 
issue again.3.2.2 Partnership Arrangements 
45. The National Implementing Partner of the IEERB Project is the Department of Energy Efficiency (DEE) 
under the State Committee on Standardization of Belarus. The IEERB Project was designed to bring 
together the appropriate partners to promote and catalyze the interest in energy efficiency in 
residential buildings in Belarus. With many of these partners already identified in the IEERB ProDoc, 
Project resources were utilized to define partnership arrangements with these partners to 
strengthen the regulatory and legal framework for energy efficiency in buildings, build the awareness 
and technical capacity of these partners, and to collaborate with key partners to plan, design and 
construct pilot energy efficient buildings under Component 3. 
 
46. In comparison with the partners identified in Para 35-36, the PMU has effectively made partnership 
arrangements with: 
• the Ministry of Architecture and Construction and its various agencies including: 
o Stroytechnorm, a state enterprise who was a key partner in the drafting of new building 
norms and standards under the Technical Code for Energy Efficient Buildings; 
o The Institute of Housing (NIPTIS) who was principal designer of the entire pilot building in 
Mahilioŭ and designer of energy efficient equipment for pilot buildings in Minsk and 
Hrodna, and involved in the formulation of various construction norms and standards; 
• the Ministry of Housing and Utilities and its utility companies in Minsk, Hrodna and Mahilioŭ who 
were responsible for operation and maintenance of 3 pilot energy efficient buildings under 
Component 3; 
• Mahilioŭ Oblast Department of Capital Construction who was involved as a developer of the pilot 
building in Mahilioŭ, thus substituting the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental 
Protection in this capacity after the Ministry has removed from itself obligations to act as a 
developer; 
• Oblast Executive Committees in Minsk, Hrodna and Mahilioŭ and their departments of housing 
and communal services who elaborated and supervised implementation of local norms and 
provisions for utility companies. They also have oversight on heating tariffs as discussed in Para 
43; 
• MAPID JSC, a private construction firm who was responsible for design and construction of the 
energy efficient building in Minsk; 
• GrodnoGrazhdanProject RUE who was a pilot building designer in Hrodna; 
• the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources (MoNREP) and its agency “RUE 
Belarusian Research Centre Ecology” who undertake work and research related to the calculation 
and reporting of GHG emission reductions from energy efficient buildings in Belarus; 
• entities involved in the training of building technicians and practitioners including: 
o the Construction Faculty of the Belarusian National Technical University (BNTU) in Minsk 
responsible for the preparation of course materials in building energy efficiency which has 
been disseminated to other relevant faculties and training institutes throughout Belarus; 
o Oblast training centres in the majority of secondary cities in Belarus (such as Hrodna and 
Mahilioŭ) to build the capacity of engineers and technicians of utility companies under the 
MoHU to operate and maintain energy efficient buildings throughout Belarus. 
47. Overall efforts by the PMU to forge effective partnership arrangements on the IEERB Project have 
been satisfactory. This includes partnership arrangements with entities with direct responsibility for 
shaping intended outcomes of the Project including the strengthening of the new construction norms and standards in Component 1, building the technical capacities of all related stakeholders under 
Component 2, and the development of 3 pilot energy efficient buildings under Component 3. 
3.2.3 Feedback from M&E Activities Used for Adaptive Management 
48. Feedback for M&E activities was provided primarily through PSC Meeting Minutes (9 PSC meetings 
from April 2013 to December 2017) and PIRs (from 2014 to 2017) providing details of activities for 
adaptively managing the Project. This would include sections in the PIRs on “annual project quality 
assurance assessments” and “critical risk management” where recommendations on managing risks 
are divided into political, regulatory, organizational, and strategic categories. Strategic risks would 
include risks with stakeholder engagement of an important stakeholder group such as construction 
companies or building professionals. 
49. The quality of PSC meeting minutes was satisfactory with these reports providing details of 
structured discussions on the progress of the Project, how to improve implementation performance 
and reduce risks, and approval of ongoing work plans or changes to these work plans. The Evaluation 
Team notes that the discussions and adaptive management changes proposed during these meetings 
were completed with 13 to 20 PSC members in attendance for the 9 PSC meetings. 
50. The 4 PIRs produced by the IEERB Project were also sufficiently detailed to provide Project progress 
against objective level and outcome targets, notwithstanding the issues with the PRF (mainly lack of 
SMART indicators) which are discussed in Paras 29-31. 
51. With the overall outcomes of the Project being satisfactory, the feedback provided by these PIRs to 
monitor progress towards meeting set PRF targets of the IEERB Project is satisfactory. 
3.2.4 Project Finance 
52. The IEERB Project had a GEF budget of USD 4.50 million that was to be fully disbursed over a 6-year 
duration, managed by the PMU under the direction of DEE. Table 3 reveals very little deviation 
between the actual outcome expenditures and original ProDoc Outcome expenditures. The only 
significant deviation would be the actual annual expenditures versus the projected annual 
expenditures. The information notes that annual expenditures in 2014 and 2015 were only 81% and 
76% of projected expenditures while 2016 expenditures were 144% of ProDoc expenditures. This 
indicates and is confirmed by the Evaluation that implementation of the demonstration buildings 
under Component 3 was slow in delivery primarily due to late commencement of these buildings in 
2014 after MoNREP withdrew its co-financing support of the Project. 
53. Project co-financing was US$15.2 million which is only 55% of the ProDoc estimate of USD 27.70 
million. Co-financing details can be found on Table 4. The level of co-financing on the IEERB Project 
is reflective of the commitments of all stakeholders, of which 76% came from the owners of the 
demonstration buildings, 10.5% from in-kind contributions from DEE, and the remaining 10.5% from 
in-kind contributions from other government agencies involved with IEERB (such as oblasts training 
centres and state enterprises). Though the co-financing for IEERB did not meeting its target, the cost 
effectiveness of the IEERB Project has been satisfactory in consideration of impacts of the IEERB 
Project, some of which are significant such as the preparation of the TC-EPB, capacity building of 
stakeholders, and the completion of 3 demonstration buildings, the details of which are provided

54. Table 5 provides IEERB Project expenditures during the 6-year implementation period. The 
breakdown shows 54% of GEF funds were expended on supporting capital costs of the demonstration 
buildings (as indicated by ATLAS budgetary lines for 72200, 72300 and 73200 which cover 
construction services and the procurement and installation of energy efficient equipment in the pilot 
buildings). Roughly 33% of the GEF funds were spent on Project personnel and consultants (as 
indicated by ATLAS budgetary lines for 71200, 71300, 71400 and 71600); this includes services for 
the engineering design of the demonstration buildings as well as international consultants. The 
remaining 13% of the funds for workshops, trainings and conferences, and travel costs to neighboring 
regional countries. Roughly 5% of GEF funds were for Project Management. Shortfalls in the budgets 
for consulting time, travel costs to other countries and workshops were made up through UNDP cofinancing. 
3.2.5 M&E Design at Entry and Implementation 
55. The M&E design as covered in Section IV (Pgs 29-34) in the IEERB Project ProDoc is robust and 
thorough. The design thoroughly covers all M&E activities including: • the Project inception phase; 
• monitoring responsibilities and advance; 
• monitoring reporting requirements including annual Project reviews and Project implementation 
reports (APRs/PIRs); 
• independent evaluations that includes the Midterm Evaluation as well as the Final Evaluation; 
• Project audits; and 
• dissemination of Project results to encourage learning and knowledge sharing. 
Despite the weaknesses of the PRF (as explained in Para 29), the M&E design is rated as satisfactory. 
56. The M&E plan was executed according to the designed as detailed in Para 55. The Evaluation Team 
has had access to review a Project Inception phase report, PIRs, MTR, Project audits, PSC meeting 
minutes, as well as Project logs (for risk, monitoring, lessons and issues). All these files especially the 
Project logs provide good insights into the management of the IEERB Project in the identification of 
risk, issues and corresponding management responses. In addition, these Project logs also 
documented checklists for the M&E plan on a semi-annual basis to ensure compliance with the 
original M&E plan. With these files having been reviewed by the Evaluation Team, M&E plan 
implementation is rated as satisfactory. Ratings according to the GEF Monitoring and Evaluation
system27 are as follows: 
• M&E design at entry - 5; 
• M&E plan implementation - 5; 
• Overall quality of M&E - 5. 
3.2.6 Performance of Implementing and Executing Entities
57. The performance of the implementing partner, the Department of Energy Efficiency, can be 
characterized as follows: 
• DEE provided an appropriate level of guidance to the PMU with regards to the work required to 
update the Technical Code for energy efficiency in buildings during the early stages of the Project. 
This included assistance in sourcing technical specialists for the Technical Committee for 
Standardization or TCS-14 for preparing the TC-EPB; 
• accelerated the approval of the TC-EPB by involving and informing policy makers of other 
ministries (such as Ministry of Energy, MoNREP, Ministry of Economy, and MoAC) of the work of 
the Technical Committee on updating the TC-EPB; 
• support to the PMU to obtain approval for the full adoption of the TC-EPB from the Council of 
Ministers; 
 
27 6 = HS or Highly Satisfactory: There were no shortcomings; 
 5 = S or Satisfactory: There were minor shortcomings, 
 4 = MS or Moderately Satisfactory: There were moderate shortcomings; 
 3 = MU or Moderately Unsatisfactory: There were significant shortcomings; 
 2 = U or Unsatisfactory: There were major shortcomings; 
 1 = HU or Highly Unsatisfactory 
 U/A = Unable to assess 
 N/A = Not applicable.• Overall performance is rated as satisfactory. 
58. The performance of UNDP (the Implementing Agency) can be characterized as follows: 
• UNDP’s responsibility for the design of the IEERB Project should have included the sufficient time 
required for the proper monitoring of energy savings from pilot buildings. From the observations 
of the TE team, monitoring of energy savings from these buildings was not able to commence 
upon completion of these buildings due to the normal practice of new tenants not immediately 
occupying these units (due to the work required to retrofit these units to the liking of the tenants, 
work that often takes more than 6 months). In addition, full occupancy of the buildings would 
be necessary for establishing normal energy consumption of these buildings which likely would 
not occur for 12 months more after the completion of the EE building; 
• UNDP support for the early adaptive management measures of the IEERB Project, much of which 
was required to minimize implementation delays to the Project during its early stages in 2012 
and 2013; 
• Highly effective PMU engaged in facilitating several effective Project partnerships with key 
stakeholders with direct impacts on the intended outcomes of the Project; 
• Excellent engagement of PMU with design and construction teams of the pilot energy efficient 
buildings to the extent that these buildings were completed by December 2016 and May 2017; 
• UNDP efforts to link with other similar building energy efficiency projects in the region has 
facilitated knowledge building on energy efficiency in buildings regionally (mainly CIS countries) 
and raised the profile of the IEERB Project in Belarus and other countries; 
• UNDP assistance in providing a communications strategy (identification of targets audiences and 
scoping communications modalities) to more effectively raise the profile of energy efficiency in 
residential buildings; 
• Overall performance of UNDP on the IEERB Project is rated as satisfactory. 
59. A summary of ratings of the implementing and executing entities of the IEERB Project are as follows: 
• Implementing Partner (DEE) – 5; 
• Implementing Entity (UNDP) – 5; 
• Overall quality of implementation/execution (UNDP/DEE) – 5. 
3.3 Project Results 
60. This section provides an overview of the overall results of the IEERB Project and assessment of the 
relevance, effectiveness and efficiency, country ownership, mainstreaming, sustainability, and 
impact of the IEERB Project. In addition, evaluation ratings for overall results, effectiveness, 
efficiency and sustainability are also provided against the revised June 2013 PRF (as provided in 
Appendix G)28. For Tables 6, 8, 9, 10 and 11, the “status of target achieved” is color-coded according 
to the following color coding scheme: 
Green: Completed, 
indicator shows successful 
achievements 
Yellow: Indicator shows 
expected completion by the 
EOP 
Red: Indicator shows poor 
achievement – unlikely to be 
completed by Project closure 
 
28 Evaluation ratings are on a scale of 1 to 6 as defined in Footnote 27. 3.3.1 Overall Results 
61. A summary of the achievements of IEERB Project at the Project Objective level with evaluation 
ratings are provided on Table 6. 
62. Progress towards the target of 80 multistory residential buildings that have integrated new EE 
measures into their design did not commence until substantial progress was made by 2014 in the 
preparation of the “Technical Code for Energy Performance of Buildings” or TC-EPB within Outcome 
1, which is explained in detail in Section 3.3.2. To date, the State Standardization Committee and its 
Principal Department of State Expertise in Construction report that there are over 87 buildings 
(520,000 m2) that have been designed to consume less than 30 kWh/m2 annually for heating (from 
a baseline of 60 kWh/m2
 annually that is the current energy performance of most of the buildings 
and corresponding to the currently valid standards until the TC-EPB is adopted). 
63. GHG emission reduction estimates against the targets of 80 buildings and 220,000 tonnes of CO2
(lifetime) of emission reductions were calculated: 
• from energy audits of expected energy savings from 87 buildings 29 totaling 520,000 m2
developed by several companies (such as “10-UNR-Invest” JSC, Saint-Gobain Construction 
Product BelRus and “Magistr” JSC) with some of energy efficiency improvement measures that 
were advocated by the Project to help improve the energy performance of buildings from class 
B to classes A and A+ (such as the forced ventilation with exhaust air heat recuperation, solar 
heaters, automatic regulation and dispatching of thermal energy consumption). These design 
features were included for reducing annual SEC for HVAC systems to comply with Amendment 
#3 to Technical Standard No. 45-2.04-196-2010 enforced since October 1, 2015. Detailed 
calculation of the estimated 706,200 tons CO2 emission reductions using the GEF EE Tool is 
provided in Appendix E. The number of EE buildings constructed during IEERB implementation 
are shown on Table 7; 
• by including the expected energy consumption of the 3 pilot buildings in Mahilioŭ, Minsk, and 
Hrodna (under Outcome 3) within the 87 completed buildings where space heating is 25, 25 and 
15 kWh/m2 respectively and for hot water supply is 20, 40 and 30 kWh/m2 respectively, totaling 
45, 65 and 45 kWh/m2
 for these pilot buildings. Baseline values for heating and hot water supply 
were assumed to be 40-50 and 80-90 kWh/m2 respectively on which GHG emission reductions 
were calculated. Assuming a 30-year lifetime of the pilot buildings, a lifetime GHG emission 
reductions from these 3 demonstration buildings was estimated to be 24,100 tonnes CO2. 
64. For these reasons and the Project having met its objective level targets, the evaluation has 
determined that the rating for objective level achievements of IEERB is highly satisfactory. While 
these targets are based on the assumption of submitted design documentation of the EE buildings, 
the Project has not yet had an opportunity to develop large monitoring data sets for actual specific 
thermal energy consumption of these EE buildings through direct energy monitoring consumption. 
This is further discussed in Para 88. GHG emission reductions estimated for the Project are 
summarized on the GEF Tracking Tool as provided in Appendix F.

• develop for adoption an endorsed methodology for building energy performance monitoring in 
line with EN and other applicable international standards (Output 1.1); 
• complete at least 50 completed energy audits providing information on factual energy 
consumption and energy balance of different type of existing residential buildings of different

, 
Class A: 24-30 kWh/m2, and Class B: 30-48 kWh/m2. The design of these energy efficient multi-storey residential buildings to the 
standard of Classes A and A+ were a result of the capacity building efforts under Outcome 2 involving seminars and workshops 
on technical designs in engineering solutions for energy efficient buildings.

energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources, including an analysis of the costefficiency of different heat supply and distribution methods to serve low or close to zero-energy 
buildings (Output 1.3); 
• complete an analysis of the possibility of using different heat supply systems typically used in 
Belarus, including centralized heating systems, in particular, radiator systems connected to 
district heating and water heating systems for designing and construction of new efficient 
buildings with recommendations for future development prepared (Output 1.4); 
• prepare a finalized draft (with agreement from all stakeholders) of new national functional 
energy performance-based norms and standards for newly constructed buildings, and buildings 
subjected to a major renovation for primary use in residential buildings (Output 1.5); 
• elaborate on practical procedures for the establishment of a mandatory system of EE 
certification of buildings that is adopted by the Government of Belarus, including issuing of EE 
passports and an established system of monitoring and compliance checking with set norms 
(Output 1.6); and 
• further develop quality standards and a system of EE certification for the construction materials, 
equipment and accessories used in the construction sector that are adopted by all stakeholders 
(Output 1.7). 
A summary of the actual achievements of the Outcome 1 with evaluation ratings are provided on 
Table 8. 
66. The baseline of this activity were ongoing efforts to develop the TC-EPB which resulted in slow 
adoption of any proposed revisions on construction norms related to minimum energy performance 
standards (MEPS) for buildings by the Government. In April 2013, the GoB adopted the State Housing 
Policy Concept (to 2016) stipulating newly constructed residential buildings to be in line with 
improved energy performance standards. The timing of the Project was excellent in providing 
incremental assistance through the formation of a technical committee with international advisors 
to accelerate the development of a Technical Code to serve as a key legal framework to enforce 
MEPS that improve energy efficiency of new buildings. 
67. The thrust of the development of the TC-EPB was its harmonization with EU Directive 2010/31/EU 
concerning energy performance of residential buildings. The Project engaged "RUE StroyTechNorm" 
(STN) who assembled the Technical Committee on Standardization in the Field of Architecture & 
Construction (TCS-14) in 2014 to lead the development of the TC-EPB; the Technical Committee 
consisted of 20 members (including four Project’s experts) from various entities throughout Belarus 
including those working under an Energy Efficiency Committee within DEE. TCS-14 with the 
assistance of Project resources undertook a number of activities to develop the TC-EPB including: 
• a critical analysis of methodologies and practices established in EU and in Belarus in 2013 and 
2014. This analysis revealed a high level of harmonization of these methodologies and practices 
between national standards and the corresponding EU Directive 2010/31/EU, notwithstanding 
that the national regulations were still missing important provisions for minimum energy 
performance and the measurement and verification of integral energy performance of different 
types of residential buildings; UNDP – Government of the Republic of Belarus Terminal Evaluation of I

multi-storey residential buildings in 2013-2015 (see Para 75 for more details), the experience of 
which was disseminated during training workshops for 70 professional energy auditors in 2013 
and 2014; 
• developing an energy efficiency certification system and a system of monitoring and compliance 
checking applicable to residential buildings in late 2014 with the assistance of international and 
national consultants; 
• support for 2 round-table sessions for relevant stakeholders where main principles and 
framework of the certification system were discussed, leading to the development of a “Building 
Energy Passport” that includes energy efficiency rating of building’s HVAC system. The Passport 
was to serve as an integral part of approved design and construction documentation that would 
contain all major requirements for certifying energy performance of a building; 
• drafting of the TC-EPB as a regulatory enactment that contains, inter alia, the minimum building 
energy performance (MBEP) requirements, and corresponding provisions for energy certification 
and compliance checking systems and energy audit. This was approved by TCS-14 and 
incorporated in 2015 into the State List of Technical Norms & Standards Pending Adoption in the 
Field of Energy Saving for 2011-2015 (as amended №1, №2, №3) and Amendment No.1 to the 
State Standardization Plan of the Republic of Belarus for 2014-2015; 
• revision of some of core standards integral to the TC-EPB leading to its adoption and approval by 
GosStandard as of 21 December 201536; 
• assisting DEE since late 2016 to obtain approval of the TC-EPB of a number of ministries as a legal 
act, which has been successfully passed national conciliation procedures and forwarded to the 
Council of Ministers for final adoption. As of May 2018, this process was nearing completion 
with possible completion within 2018, and is an excellent accomplishment by the IEERB Project. 
 
34 This would include “Method of calculation of specific heat consumption for heating and ventilation in residential buildings”; 
"Energy performance of buildings - Assessment of overall energy consumption and energy performance of buildings"; "Energy 
efficiency of buildings - Methods for determination of energy efficiency and energy certification buildings "; and amendments to 
“Thermal protection of buildings. Energy performance characteristics. Rules of definition”. 
35 To validate the guidelines and build capacity for project partners, IEERB Project supported an energy audit of 5 multi-storey 
houses built by these partners. 
36 Such as STB 2409-2015; amendments to STB EN 15603-2014; STB EN 15316-4-2015 (eight parts); amendments to STB EN 15217-
2014; amendments to TCP 45-2.04-196-2010 68. Adoption of the TC-EPB and its standards, however, was initially not embraced by the construction 
industry in Belarus in 2016. Feasibility of the required measures was questioned along with the 
preliminary cost-effectiveness analyses of different technical solutions to improve energy efficiency 
of buildings. Project-supported analysis in 2017 has demonstrated that under the existing tariff 
regime where heating tariffs are too low, there was and currently is a lack of incentives both for 
developers and households to build and operate buildings with energy efficient heating and hot water 
systems. Notwithstanding the work of TCS-14 to justify the feasibility of the EE designs of the 
Outcome 3 demonstration projects and its benchmarking against EU experience as best practice to 
local developers and builders, this discussion has only raised the importance of monitoring and 
reporting the energy consumption of the demonstration buildings under Outcome 3. This 
information could then inform revised tariff policies for heating and hot water. This is further 
discussed in Paras 102, 105 and 112. 
69. In conclusion, the results of Outcome 1 are rated as satisfactory with the following rationale: 
• The completion of the development of MBEP standards, specifically for energy efficiency for 
heating and hot water in new buildings that are now mandatory; 
• The development and completion of an energy audit methodology for assessing building energy 
efficiency for heating and hot water; 
• The completion and use of a certification scheme for EE buildings, both of which have been 
included in the TC-EPB; 
• Review of the TC-EPB by the Council of Ministers and the Ministry of Justice for promulgation 
likely in June 2018; and 
• Lack of incentives for the construction industry to install costly energy efficient heating and hot 
water systems due to existing heating tariffs, which prolong cost recovery periods of the 
investments. 
3.3.3 Outcome 2: Enhanced expert capacity of the Belarusian specialists to implement new 
energy efficiency standards and construction norms 
70. To achieve Outcome 2, Project resources would be utilized to: 
• develop and publish different target groups’ technical guides, handbooks and other related 
training materials on energy efficiency design and construction of new buildings, materials that 
would be used for introducing new construction norms and disseminated through an internetbased energy platform and the Project’s website (Output 2.1); 
• develop new courses on integrated building design and building energy efficiency to be included 
into the curricula of universities educating architects and building engineers, and with at least 
200 students having passed new courses by the end of the Project (Output 2.2); 
• train at least 50 experts from different state and municipal administrative bodies (who deal with 
construction policies, norms and standards) on the most recent international developments, 
practices and international experience learnt on building energy efficiency and environmentally 
sustainable construction (Output 2.3); 
• train at least 50 architects and construction engineers from the leading architecturalconstruction institutes (Output 2.4) on: o the most recent international developments in the area of energy efficient buildings; 
technical and managerial aspects; 
o integrated energy efficient building design principles and techniques; 
o practical aspects of designing buildings when moving from prescriptive to functional 
construction norms in the energy saving sphere; 
o possible technical solutions and principles of cost-effective design for optimizing building 
energy performance; and 
o presentation of the available, state-of-the-art software to support integrated, energy 
efficient building design and training for its use; 
• train at least 50 construction inspectors from Regional and District centers on methodologies for 
assessing building energy performance and the correct installation of the materials and 
equipment used (Output 2.5); 
• train least 50 mid-level supervisors of the construction companies on correct installation of 
materials and equipment, and provide other advice for private construction companies on how 
to integrate elements of energy-efficient design throughout the project cycle from the design of 
buildings to their construction and operation (Output 2.6); 
• deliver a 2-week training seminar to 25 people including professional designers, representatives 
of the state expertise and building supervision to familiarize them with the experiences of 
energy-efficient building design (including visiting the facilities), and organization of state 
supervision from EU countries including the role of municipal authorities (Output 2.7); and 
• deliver other trainings and information meetings to facilitate exchange of experience and 
knowledge based on co-operation with other international initiatives promoting energy efficient 
and environmentally sustainable building construction (Output 2.8). 
A summary of the actual achievements of Outcome 2 with evaluation ratings are provided on Table 
9. 
71. The baseline scenario of the Project was only 3 out of more than 120 design institutes in Belarus 
using a new design approach to energy efficiency for buildings, with little to no dissemination of this 
new approach beyond the local design institutes of NIPTIS, MAPID and Grodnograzhdanproekt. Prior 
to training being delivered (around June 2014), the Project had completed: 
• an analysis of target groups along with assessment of needs in their capacity building (following 
meetings with Energy Efficiency Department and round-table discussions on a capacity building 
action plan for 2014-2015); 
• 15 special technical reports and guidelines on energy efficiency design principles for 
dissemination to various training and academic institutes (as a part of Output 2.1). This included 
important issues such as cost efficiency analysis of different technical options applicable to the 
development of energy efficient residential buildings and development of designs for the pilot 
buildings of Outcome 3; 
• analysis of curricula of different relevant universities and proposals to improve the curricula to 
address building energy efficiency through suggested university courses; 
• drafting of recommendations for updating relevant university curricular as approved at a round 
table with 60 stakeholders; and 
• a draft of the proposed syllabus to the boards of universities for their adoption. UNDP – Government of the Republic of Belarus Terminal Evaluation of I

7 Ibid 27 72. The Project supported the training for a wide spectrum of building professionals that commenced 
with the preparation of appropriate training materials in 2013 and 2014. Project consultants 
prepared 250 technical reports of high quality for introducing new principles into design and 
construction of energy efficient housing as delivery of Outputs 2.1. Many of these reports have been 
adopted by academic institutes such as the Construction Faculty of BNTU in Minsk. Dissemination 
of these materials were supplemented by presentations, lectures, leaflets, brochures and guidelines 
through numerous 6-day training sessions in Minsk and Hrodna, dedicated to construction policies, 
norms and standards, recent international developments, integrated energy efficient building design 
principles and techniques, available technical options and correct installation of the materials and 
equipment used, and methodologies for assessing energy performance. 
73. By 2014, the 3 new courses related to best international and national practice in the field of design 
and construction of energy efficient residential buildings were presented by the Project through 
meetings and round-table discussions with 14 faculties of 7 universities, 3 national universities. The 
outcome of these meetings was agreement for inclusion of these new courses in their syllabi, serving 
as a deliverable of Output 2.2. In June 2017, the Belarusian National Technical University (BNTU) 
incorporated 16 tutorials and reference books developed by the Project into the curriculum of their 
Construction Faculty that provides up to 90 hours of lectures for 540 students within 5 specialized 
construction fields. 
74. As a part of the delivery of Outputs 2.3 and 2.4, a training campaign from 2014 to 2016 was attended 
by over 30 construction companies with more than 70 specialists and decision-makers attending 
these sessions. Attendees also received certificates for the completion of these training sessions 
from DEE. As a part of Output 2.5, more than 50 representatives of construction companies had 
passed practical courses by late 2016, coupled with actual visits to become familiar with the energy 
efficient engineering systems being installed in three demonstration buildings in Mahilioŭ, Minsk and 
Hrodna. By June 2017, there were already 16 local design organizations38 out of 120 design institutes 
that are incorporating energy efficiency improvements as developed and advocated by the Project 
into the design and construction of residential buildings. This is a good indicator of the gradual 
adoption of energy efficiency improvements for housing construction practices. 
75. A common theme for the trainings delivered by Outputs 2.5 and 2.6 was energy auditing of buildings. 
By November 2016, detailed energy audits were completed for 55 multi-storey residential buildings 
of different type and age. The collective conclusion of these audits were that multi-storey residential 
buildings in Belarus have an average annual energy consumption of 170 kWh/m2 of thermal energy 
for HVAC and hot water. This report with its recommendations to improve energy efficiency of the 
monitored buildings was distributed to 70 professionals who attended five 2-day training workshops 
on energy audits of residential building. These workshops focused on methodology guidelines for 
energy audit, energy performance monitoring and calculation as applicable to residential buildings 
and based on the results of actual energy audits of the 55 buildings conducted by the Project 
between 2014 and 2016. A follow-up survey by the Project indicated that more than 35% of trainees 
became involved and performed energy audit of residential buildings in practice.

for 58 decision-makers, designers, builders and other relevant specialists for their participation on 8 
study visits to five European countries (Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, England and France)39 and 
16 international events abroad on best practice for energy efficient residential buildings design, 
construction and operation as well as legal framework, standards and policies. Some of these visits 
and events included: 
• 3 attendees from NIPTIS and MoAC who took part in 2 Annual International Conferences on 
Passive Houses in Germany in 2015 and 2016; 
• 5 DEE representatives took part in annual UNECE sessions in Geneva from 2013 to 2018; 
• the first study tour for 9 professionals and officials in September 2013 to Germany focusing on 
construction of residential buildings; 
• two 5-day study tours to the United Kingdom concurrent with EcoBuild Forums during 3-7 March 
2014 and 2-6 March 2015 for 13 professionals and officials with a focus on policies and standards, 
and as well as on advanced principles in design, construction and operation of energy efficient 
buildings; 
• three 5-day study tours to Austria in between 2012 and 2014 for 30 decision-makers and relevant 
specialists to study design, construction and operation practices as well as with legal framework, 
standards and policies in the energy efficiency and energy saving in the residential sector. 
77. By late 2016, the Project was also supporting as part of the delivery of Output 2.8 attendance of DEE 
officials and specialists trained by the Project to higher profile events and initiatives including: 
• The ENES-2016 Forum in Russian Federation for persons including decision-makers and a 
technical specialist. The Forum was an opportunity for the Project to share their experiences on 
best practices in energy efficiency and environmentally sound construction and operation of 
buildings with their foreign colleagues; 
• the Conferences of the Parties to the UNFCCC in Paris in December 2015 and in Marrakech in 
November 2016 for one expert as a response from requests from the MoNREP and Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs for participation. Project experts provided background information for the official 
delegation before and during the Conferences to formulate and specify country positions; and 
• South-South cooperation with the UNDP projects dedicated to improvement of energy efficiency 
of residential buildings in Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The Project organized a 
series of activities in July 2016 that included visits to the pilot project sites, as well as to housebuilding factories in Minsk, Mahilioŭ and Hrodna. Twelve experts from these projects and 
representatives of governmental agencies of these countries took part in these activities and 
received additional and detailed information about energy efficiency improvement measures, 
practices and regulation exercised in Belarus. 
78. As an adaptive management measure as mentioned in Para 43, the Project in early 2017 commenced 
a new series of trainings for professionals from construction companies, housing operation entities 
and utilities as well as for tenants with practical courses at the project pilot sites in Minsk, Mahilioŭ 
and Hrodna. In May 2017, three training sessions were held for tenants in the demonstration 
 
39 Some of the study tours were co-financed by host parties totalling close to US$105,000. This would include IWO e.V., Germany, 
Sep 2-7, 2013; Austrian Energy Agency, Austria, Dec 2-5, 2013, March 26-28, 2014, Sep 08-11, 2014; Czech Trust Fund, Czech 
Republic, Nov 22-28, 2015. residential buildings in Minsk, Hrodna and Mahilioŭ. During the heating season of 2017-2018, four 
1-day training workshops with on-site practical exercises were conducted for 50 specialists of 
municipal services responsible for operation of the pilot residential buildings in Hrodna and Mahilioŭ. 
79. An important outcome from these activities is the improved capacity of the construction industry 
and the engineering profession in Belarus to plan, design and implement energy efficient building 
according to the standards set in the TC-EPB. With regards to the 87 new buildings that comply with 
the TC-EPB as reported by the Principal Department of State Expertise in Construction (mentioned 
in Paras 62, 63 and 87), not all of these energy efficient buildings inherited all aspects of the EE 
designs from the Outcome 3 demonstration building designs. Notwithstanding, the Project has made 
a significant contribution to the capacities of building sector personnel to be able to implement an 
A/A+ class building, an improvement from the B and C classes. These building developers are 
incorporating a range of improvements such as automatic regulation and dispatching of thermal 
energy, and special designs for building envelope that use heat recuperation, solar collectors, and 
small compact ventilators with heat recovery. None of them, however, have designed a residential 
building with heat pumps. 
80. In conclusion, the results of Outcome 2 can be rated highly satisfactory due to: 
• the PMU effectively engaging the appropriate stakeholders in Belarus to advance activities of the 
Project to achieve desired outcomes and objective; and 
• catalysing interest amongst a wide range of stakeholder on energy efficiency in buildings. 
3.3.4 Outcome 3: Implementation of demonstration projects for energy efficient buildings 
81. To achieve Outcome 3, Project resources would be utilized to:
• finalize design of the demo buildings by applying integrated building design principles and 
incorporating new technologies and approaches for meeting the HVAC needs of those buildings 
in a most energy and cost-efficient way (Output 3.1); 
• provide oversight in the completion of construction of the demo buildings by ensuring that 
construction and equipment installation are completed in accordance with the adopted 
standards and guidelines (Output 3.2); 
• prepare a monitoring report on the progress of construction of three demonstration buildings, 
documenting costs, experiences gained and lessons learnt from procuring, installing and testing 
the new energy efficient materials, and new construction techniques and appliances, as well as 
documenting the experiences and lessons learnt from procuring, installing and testing the new 
energy efficient materials, construction techniques and appliances (Output 3.3); 
• prepare a monitoring report on the energy performance of the demonstration buildings, 
documenting the actual energy and financial savings and GHG emission reductions, and 
documenting the actual energy and financial savings and GHG emission reduction from each 
building as a whole and from each specific energy efficiency measure and appliance tested 
(Output 3.4); 
• conduct at least 30 private showings of the new buildings organized for architects, designers and 
other responsible decision-makers, including half-day training sessions with an objective to 
promote the solutions adopted for the demonstration projects and buildings (Output 3.5). A summary of the actual achievements of Outcome 3 with evaluation ratings are provided on Table 
10. 
82. Prior to the commencement of Component 3, there were no energy efficient residential buildings 
with comparable energy performance in Belarus that could be monitored and used to inform policy 
for energy efficient buildings, and which could be used to demonstrate to the public and relevant 
building stakeholders the potential and feasibility of energy efficiency improvement measures in 
residential buildings. 
83. By the end of 2013, sites of the 3 pilot buildings with energy efficient heating and hot water systems 
were finalized with NIPTIS serving as the designer of these systems for all 3 demonstration buildings 
located in: 
• Grodno for a 10-storey house where the general designer is RUE "Grodnograzhdanproyekt 
Institute" and the builder is “GrodnoZhylStroy” JSC; 
• Mahilioŭ for a 10-storey building40 where the general designer is NIPTIS and the builder is "UKS 
Mahilioŭ"; and 
• Minsk for a 19-floor building where the general designer and builder is JSC MAPID. 
84. During 2014, design studies for these 3 demonstration buildings were completed by Project’s experts 
and NIPTIS as delivery of Output 3.1 that included: 
• Optimization of the architectural design of the building (including the shape, orientation, and 
placing of windows) through the inclusion of energy efficient equipment and increasing use of 
renewable energy resources; 
• Improved thermal insulation of the building envelope in accordance with the most recent norms 
and requirements that are or will be adopted in EU countries with the climatic conditions similar 
to Belarus and by optimizing required thermal retention values of each building component by 
integrating cost and energy consumption considerations of the entire building; 
• Forced ventilation with heat recovery up to 80% from the exhaust air for each of the buildings; 
• Heat recovery from wastewater to be used for preheating of sanitary hot water for each of the 
buildings; 
• Solar water heaters to provide thermal energy for HVAC system and sanitary hot water for 
building in Mahilioŭ; 
• Heat pumps that utilize ground heat through foundation piles and utilize heat from district 
sewage collector for building in Hrodna; 
• Solar PV-panels to reduce electricity consumption of the heat pumps in Hrodna; 
• Real time and remote monitoring and regulation of heat and hot water consumption; and 
• Dispatcher system for energy consumption data.

1 Ibid 27 85. The outcome of these design studies led to the installation of the most cost-effective energy efficient 
solutions based on integrated building design principles and renewable energy technologies that 
minimize heat and power consumption of the buildings at least by a minimum factor of 2. Design 
documentation for the above principals and technologies for all 3 pilot buildings was completed by 
NIPTIS in mid-2015 and submitted to the State Expert Appraisal Committee under MoAC in October 
2015 for approval to construct. This included construction documentation for the installation of 
energy efficient equipment, general provisions and instructions for construction techniques, building 
operation and maintenance works of the pilot buildings. Approval for construction was received in 
June 2016. One issue that did arise for these buildings was RUE “GrodnoGrazhdanProject” informing 
the PMU in 2015 that they will not be able to provide further sustainable financing of the 
demonstration building in Hrodna. The PMU and UNDP CO have, in cooperation with the Head of EE 
Department, approached the Grodno authorities to recruit “GrodnoZhylStroi” JSC to take over this 
demonstration project. 
86. Project resources were used to cover the cost of additional energy efficiency measures estimated to 
be around 17% of the total capital cost of these buildings. Project partners provided the necessary 
technical supervision during the construction of the building envelope and installation of the energy 
efficient equipment by subcontractors. Technical supervision reports as a part of the delivery of 
Output 3.2 were generated during this period including information on necessary adjustments to 
ensure proper installation of equipment that would perform to the intended standards and 
guidelines in the design documentation. Construction completion dates of the demonstration 
buildings were 14 December 2016 for Mahilioŭ, 26 January 2017 for Minsk and 20 May 2017 for 
Hrodna. Energy efficiency features of each demonstration building consisted of supplementing heat 
supplies from district CHP plants with heat from: 
• recovery of wastewater heat in each building using heat exchangers to supplement energy for 
heating and hot water; 
• mechanical heating and ventilation system for each residential unit with a system to recover heat 
from air exhaust from each unit; 
• heat pumps for the demonstration building in Hrodna that were integrated with the foundation 
piles including 32 heat exchangers and thermal probes and the recovery of heat from a district 
sewage pipe; 
• PV-panels on the south façade and roof to generate grid electricity in pilot building in Hrodna 
which is to be sold to the grid and reduce electricity costs to the building tenants; 
• solar collectors using heated glycol that supplements heat both for HVAC system and for the hot 
water supply system in the Mahilioŭ demonstration building. 
87. The resulting energy performance of these buildings for space heating and hot water supply was to 
be equal or less than 60 kWh/m2
/yr according to design documents. Specific thermal energy 
consumption for the Mahilioŭ, Minsk and Hrodna pilot buildings was estimated as 25, 25 and 15 
kWh/m2
/yr respectively for space heating, and 20, 40 and 30 kWh/m2/yr, respectively for hot water 
supply. A monitoring report on the progress of construction of three demonstration buildings, 
documenting costs, experiences gained and lessons learnt has been completed in 2018 as delivery 
of Output 3. This report includes lessons learned from procuring, installing and testing the new 
energy efficient materials, and new construction techniques and appliances, as well as documenting the experiences and lessons learnt from procuring, installing and testing the new energy efficient 
materials, construction techniques and appliances. 
88. During 2017 and 2018, regular visits to the pilot buildings were made by local architects, designers, 
builders and decision makers as delivery of Output 3.5. However, despite the Project’s target to 
monitor the energy consumption from these pilot buildings for a period of one year, the Project, 
although conducting the monitoring of these pilot buildings for a period of 12 months, has not had 
the opportunity to obtain continuous energy consumption data and has not delivered Output 3.4 in 
full due to: 
• occupancy of the pilot buildings during the evaluation mission of February 2018 being less than 
30%. In May 2018, the occupancy rate reached 42%. With this occupancy rate, the inhabitants 
of each unit in each building have been reluctant to use the energy efficiency features, which 
have been resulting in higher utility costs (for both heating and electricity). This is due to: 
o the use of electricity (at the 80.2% cost recovery tariff as shown on Figure 1) for these 
features has a fixed cost for operating the pumps, fans and meters all of which would 
have been distributed amongst fewer households due to the low occupancy rate; and 
o the preference for heat from the CHPs which is only charged at a tariff equivalent to a 
21.4% cost recovery rate (see Figure 1); 
• most of the occupied units of the demonstration buildings not having normalized energy 
consumptive patterns due to the common practice when new housing units are purchased in 
Belarus, of new tenants typically taking up to one year to undertake retrofits (required for 
painting walls, installation of necessary kitchen appliances and washing machines along with 
piping for these facilities, ducting and electrical connections, and other adjustments). It is highly 
probable that normalized energy consumptive patterns would occur in the next heating season 
of 2018-2019 when there is a stronger likelihood all units would be occupied with completed 
retrofits; 
• the recent data of monitoring nevertheless show that almost two third of families who have 
already occupied the buildings consciously and properly use the system of forced ventilation with 
heat recuperation installed in each flat; and 
• the solar heaters, the system of heat pumps and the PV-station are under normal operation, as 
designed, and provide heat and electricity with certain deviations related to low energy demand. 
89. In conclusion, the results of Outcome 3 can be rated satisfactory with the following rationale: 
• The Project had managed to oversee the completion of 3 pilot energy efficient buildings as 
targeted in the ProDoc; 
• Pilot building design documentation was approved on the basis of space heating and hot water 
energy consumption being less than 60 kWh/m2
/yr; 
• Due to typical local practices of new tenants spending up to one year retrofitting a new unit, 
normal energy consumption information of space heating and hot water heating from these 
demonstration buildings could not be collected. 3.3.5 Outcome 4: Documented, disseminated and institutionalized project results providing a 
basis for further replication 
90. To achieve Outcome 4, Project resources would be utilized to deliver the following outputs: 
• Developed public awareness-raising materials and completed nation-wide awareness and 
information campaign advocating the benefits of energy saving measures, including economic, 
social, health, environmental and aesthetical aspects (Output 4.1); 
• Agreed methodology and sustainable institutional arrangements for annual market monitoring 
keeping track on buildings constructed each year, as well as the sale of key building materials, 
accessories and appliances together with their energy performance characteristics (Output 4.2);
• Fully mandated and capacitated state agency with a responsibility to monitor the energy savings 
and CO2 emission reductions in residential and other buildings, together with the agreed 
procedures for compiling the respective data (Output 4.3);

Project “Removing the Barriers to Improving Energy Efficiency in the State Sector of Belarus” 
(Output 4.6);
• A regularly updated Project website with postings on Project information that are of interest for 
all stakeholders, including the general public (with a link to an Expanded Energy Platform) 
(Output 4.7);
• Annual market monitoring reports for new building construction (Output 4.8); and 
• Final Project Report consolidating the results and lessons learnt from the implementation of the 
proposed Project components and future recommendations (Output 4.9). 
A summary of actual achievements of Outcome 4 with evaluation ratings are provided on Table 11. 
91. To date, the Project has successfully implemented numerous outreach and institutional activities 
since late 2013:
• Preparation and distribution of public awareness raising materials on energy savings in buildings 
as a part of Outputs 4.1 and 4.2. This included: 
o The Project briefs are updated and issued every quarter and distributed as leaflets to more 
than 2,500 recipients; 
o More than 90 articles, press-releases, and reviews were prepared for broadcasting through 
television broadcasts and web-based media 42 . This also included animated videos for 
residential households residents on energy efficiency in residential buildings43;

• 11 international conferences and seminars on best practice in energy efficiency improvement in 
residential buildings were organized and held under the auspices of the Project and in 
cooperation with the Energy Efficiency Department, Ministry of Architecture and Construction, 
UNDP and Austrian Energy Agency. The total audience represented more than 650 participants

92. With regards to the Project’s contribution to the “readiness of the entity to follow up and continue 
the activities initiated by the Project”, the IEERB Project has undertaken the following: 
• To deliver Output 4.2, the Project initiated a number of meetings to attract the Government’s 
attention to the monitoring issue (in addition to the fact that the energy survey has been already 
included into the Technical Code elaborated by the Project that is pending adoption). As a result, 
the Order of the Deputy Minister of MoAC (as of August 18, 2017, No.02-1-07/10773) and the 
Order of the Vice-Prime-Minister (as of February 2, 2018, No.04/8pr) were issued to assign 
responsible organizations that includes NIPTIS to prepare a related State Programme for 
monitoring and energy auditing of the housing sector to continue this monitoring until 2020 
under upcoming state programmes; 
• To deliver Output 4.3, the Government in 2014 assigned RUE “BelNITS Ecologiya” to perform as 
National Agency responsible for monitoring of GHG emission reductions in all branches of 
economy and for respective reporting to the UNFCCC Secretariat. To date, their work through 
the support of the Project and the use of the IPCC Expert Facility (that is used for preparation of 
National Communications and the National GHG Cadaster) has been used to create and verify 
the calculation protocol for GHG emission reductions generated from energy efficient buildings 
based on best international practices; 
• For Output 4.5, the Project in 2017-2018 initiated several meetings with the Institute of Urban 
and Regional Planning and TCS-14 addressing integration of EE pattern into urban development. 
In addition, the issues of urban development with energy efficient housing were discussed 
during several of the Project’s conferences and workshops starting from 2016. These discussions 
are still ongoing since the Institute of Urban and Regional Planning is reluctant to accommodate 
all new approaches. The Project issued 2 reports in 2017 and 2018 on EE urban development 
that were submitted to DEE and IURP for consideration: 
o “Proposals for urban development concepts, regional and local development plans based 
on recommendations on the integration of energy efficiency approaches into these plans”; 
 
45 Includes Earth Day Event, UN70 Express Event, 3D-Picture Event, Inclusive Belarus Campaign with press-event in Mahilioŭ, VII 
International Conference "Energy Conservation and Improving Energy Efficiency" in the framework of the XXII Energy & 
Environment Forum in 2016; “Energy efficient construction” under V Belarusian-German Energy Forum in 2016.o Amendments and additions to the technical standard TCH 45-01-284-2014 "Urban detailed 
planning. Structure and order of development” that was sent to the Institute of Urban and 
Regional Planning and TCS-14.; 
• Issuance of 3 relevant Project reports to DEE in April 2018 as a part of Output 4.8 including: 
o “Analysis of practical procedures (methodologies) and relevant provisions for the system of 
annual monitoring of the status of energy efficient housing”;
o “Institutional mechanisms for annual monitoring of the status of energy-efficient housing”; 
o “Draft provisions and methodology of the system for annual monitoring of the status of 
energy efficient housing”’; 
• For Output 4.9, the Final Project Report consolidating the results and lessons learnt from the 
implementation of the IEERB Project is being prepared for completion by 30 June 2018. 
93. In conclusion, the results of Outcome 4 can be rated satisfactory with the following rationale: 
• Delivery of a number of international and public awareness raising events a significantly racist 
the profile of energy efficiency in buildings to the Belarusian public; 
• Ongoing process of institutionalizing Project results with NIPTIS for annual market monitoring of 
new buildings and RUE “BelNITS Ecologiya” for reporting GHG emission reductions from EE 
buildings; 
• A Project website that is frequently visited and used by building practitioners in Belarus. 
3.3.6 Relevance 
94. The IEERB Project is relevant to the development priorities of the Government of Belarus which has 
been seeking efficiency improvements to specific energy consumption within building envelopes 
since 1993 as described in Para 18. In 1998, the Government of Belarus adopted a “Law on Energy 
Saving”, which was replaced by a new Law in 2015. The legal framework of this Law seeks to 
accelerate the harmonization of the country’s entire regulatory and legal system for energy efficiency 
with relevant legislative framework and technical regulations of the European Union. 
 
3.3.7 Effectiveness and Efficiency 
95. The effectiveness of the IEERB Project has been satisfactory, in consideration of resources being used 
to develop the TC-EPB that has received approval from several ministries within the Government of 
Belarus, engaged relevant building practitioners, professionals and policymakers to build their 
knowledge base on energy efficiency in buildings, and technically and financially supported the 
completion of 3 pilot EE buildings in 3 cities in Belarus. Effectiveness could have improved if the PMU 
had a PRF that better described the targets and outputs of the IEERB Project. 
96. The efficiency of the IEERB Project has been rated as moderately satisfactory in consideration of 
delays beyond the control of the Project, in the Project start-up between 2012 and 2013, delays in 
co-financing commitments including the withdrawal of MoNREP, the late commencement and 
completion of demonstration EE buildings, and the subsequent loss of opportunity for the IEERB 
Project to collect useful energy consumptive information from demonstration buildings (due to lag 
time of tenants in new buildings to generate normal energy consumptive patterns). Notwithstanding, 
the PMU for the IEERB Project has performed well under these challenging circumstances. 3.3.8 Country Ownership and Drivenness 
97. The drivenness of the Government of Belarus to lower its carbon intensity within the residential 
building sector is reflected in: 
• several standards and laws as described in Para 18 to bring specific energy consumption of 
heating and hot water systems in Belarus residential buildings closer to EU Directives; 
• actions and strong support of the Department of Energy Efficiency at PSC meetings to direct the 
IEERB PMU towards the strengthening of the TC-EPB and the capacities of building practitioners 
and professionals throughout Belarus that will improve their abilities to comply with new 
building MEPS; 
• strong support from DEE at PSC meetings to engage appropriate stakeholders to implement 
energy efficiency in new buildings; 
• Strong support from the Ministry of Architecture and Construction to implement the systems for 
the checking of designs of new buildings for compliance with the new TC-EPB. 
3.3.9 Mainstreaming 
98. The IEERB Project was successfully mainstreamed with the Belarus UNDAF (2011-2015)46, notably: 
• UNDAF Area of Cooperation 3: Assistance for ensuring environmental sustainability; 
• Agency Outcome 3.1: National capacity to mitigate and adapt to climate change enhanced; 
• Agency Output 3.1.1: Energy efficiency in buildings is improved. 
99. The IEERB Project is also successfully mainstreamed with the UNDAF for Belarus (2016-2020)47
, 
notably: 
• UNDAF Area of Cooperation 3: Environmental protection and sustainable environmental 
management based on principles of green economy; 
• Outcome 3.1.1: By 2020, policies will have been improved and measures effectively 
implemented to increase energy efficiency and the production of renewable energy to protect 
landscape and biological diversity, and to reduce anthropogenic burden on the environment; 
• Indicator 3.1.1: Reduction of GDP energy intensity (%). 
100. The IEERB Project has not made any specific efforts to mainstream gender in its activities. However, 
there was a gender balance of persons met during the Evaluation mission during February 2018, a 
positive indicator of the outcomes of the Gender Policy being implemented by the Government of 
Belarus. Several of the persons interviewed on the IEERB Evaluation mission were women in senior 
management positions with influence on Project results. 
3.3.10 Sustainability of Project Outcomes 
101. In assessing sustainability of the IEERB Project, the evaluators asked “how likely will the Project 
outcomes be sustained beyond Project termination?” Sustainability of these objectives was

47 http://un.by/images/files/ramochnaya-programma/Book_Framework_Programm_2015_.ENG_LATEST_plus_COVER.pdf evaluated in the dimensions of financial resources, socio-political risks, institutional framework and 
governance, and environmental factors, using a simple ranking scheme: 
• 4 = Likely (L): negligible risks to sustainability; 
• 3 = Moderately Likely (ML): moderate risks to sustainability; 
• 2 = Moderately Unlikely (MU): significant risks to sustainability; and 
• 1 = Unlikely (U): severe risks to sustainability; and 
• U/A = unable to assess. 
Overall rating is equivalent to the lowest sustainability ranking score of the 4 dimensions. Details of 
sustainability ratings for the IEEIRS Project are provided on Table 12. 
102. The overall IEERB Project sustainability rating is Moderately Likely (ML). This is primarily due to: 
• new buildings needing to comply with the TC-EPB to obtain approval for construction with a 
strong likelihood that the TC-EPB will be mandatory during 2018; 
• the lack of motivation of building developers in Belarus to invest in energy efficient hot water 
and heating systems until the cross subsidization of heating tariffs is reduced from 21.4% to 50% 
that will reduce payback periods from these investments to a reasonable period of time; 
• heightened awareness of the benefits of energy efficiency in buildings amongst all building 
stakeholders including various Ministry personnel with oversight on building developments in 
Belarus as well as public and private enterprises involved with designing and constructing 
buildings. This heightened awareness has led to numerous public discussions regarding the need 
for reducing cross subsidization of heating tariffs; 
• integration of energy efficiency in buildings into the curricula of several universities in training 
institutes, strengthening the capacity of building practitioners and technicians to plan, design, 
implement and operate and maintain equipment related to energy efficiency in buildings; 
• completed pilot energy efficiency buildings which can be used in future for demonstrating energy 
savings from such measures and informing Government policies on energy efficiency in buildings. 
3.3.11 Impacts 
103. The Project has made significant impacts within the building sector in Belarus: 
• Most of the standards and regulations of the TC-EPB are mandatory to ensure minimum energy 
performance of new buildings. Compliance to the TC-EPB should now be higher for the building 
sector given that building developers will now be required to comply considering that approval 
for construction of these buildings is contingent on compliance. A remaining issue for the 
Government is to strengthen their building inspections to ensure that installed equipment 
complies with their TC-EPB compliant construction drawings;
• Completion of pilot energy efficient residential buildings has raised awareness amongst key 
building professionals of key engineering design aspects of TC-EPB compliant buildings. This in 
turn has informed construction companies, both state and private entities, of a key business 
direction for construction companies; 
• The IEERB Project has raised the profile of energy efficiency in buildings through increasing the 
availability of EE building information on several and easily accessible platforms (such as the 
Project website: www.effbuild.by). UNDP – Government of the Republic of Belarus Terminal Evaluat

Overall Rating of Project Sustainability: 4. CONCLUSIONS, RECOMMENDATIONS AND LESSONS 
104. The IEERB Project has provided excellent support within a period of 6 years to improve the enabling 
environment for increased investments into EE residential buildings in Belarus, notwithstanding the 
Project having a weak Project Results Framework (PRF) which did not convey to the Evaluation Team 
the targets that the Project needed to meet to achieve its overall objective. With strong and stable 
leadership of the IEERB Project from a highly experienced and top Belarussian climate change expert, 
the IEERB PMU was able to overcome this issue and facilitate significant achievements for energy 
efficiency in the building sector in Belarus:
• It has raised awareness in Belarus amongst all building stakeholders of the benefits of energy 
efficiency in residential buildings; 
• It has provided support to the Government of Belarus in the preparation of a Technical Code on 
Energy Performance of Buildings (TC-EPB) that is aligned with EU Directive 2010/31/EU and has 
been approved by a number of key technical entities prior to its full adoption; 
• It has also improved the capacities of building professionals with various academic institutes 
through the process of preparing the TC-EPB, disseminating knowledge products and contributing 
to academic construction curriculums; 
• It has supported the completion of 3 A+ energy efficient residential buildings that will serve as an 
excellent resource for generating information on EE buildings, and inform policy improvements 
for the Government of Belarus to the TC-EPB. 
105. The long-term sustainability of the IEERB Project of reducing energy consumption and GHG emission 
reductions on new residential buildings, however, is difficult to assess considering that existing 
heating tariff rates are too low for economic justification of the installation of energy efficient 
heating equipment in buildings, and the uncertainty of when these heating tariffs will be raised from 
a 21.4% to a 50% recovery rate; as shown on Table 7, the decrease in the number of EE buildings 
approved from 2016 to 2017 is an indicator of this need for a heating tariff review and amendment. 
There have been several Government Decrees (most recently 2016) proposing the raising of heating 
tariffs from 20% to 50% of the real cost by 2020, making EE measures economically feasible after 
2020. There is also the expected full adoption of the TC-EPB that will make it mandatory for 
Belarusian building developers to implement energy efficiency measures in their buildings 
notwithstanding the low heating tariffs. 
106. Looking forward in the context of sustaining the objectives of the IEERB Project of reducing energy 
consumption and related GHG emissions with a focus on new residential buildings, the IEERB Project 
has left a solid foundation consisting of the TC-EPB, raised awareness, strengthened technical 
capacity and demonstration EE buildings (as described in Para 103). However, the building sector 
will continue to need Government support to sustain further reductions of energy consumption and 
GHG emissions from the sector: 
• Technical capacities of building technicians, operators and owners needs to be periodically 
refreshed to ensure minimization of fossil fuel consumption for heat generation from district 
CHPs. The lack of attention to maintaining these fuel system over the long-term can lead to 
increasing inefficiencies and trends of increased fuel consumption; 
• While the IEERB Project focused on energy efficiency of new buildings, the Government of 
Belarus will need to refocus its efforts in this sector on implementing energy efficiency measures for the existing building stock which is more than 98% of all buildings in Belarus, if it wishes to 
sustain a downward trajectory of energy consumption and GHG emissions from the building 
sector; 
• GHG emission reduction calculations from energy efficiency of new buildings as well as 
retrofitted existing buildings needs to be more robust and institutionalized with the involvement 
of MoNREP. While the IEERB Project has initiated work towards its institutionalization with RUE 
Belarusian Research Centre “Ecology”, continued work in this area is required to build the 
country’s database on actual energy consumption in buildings, instead of a database that only 
contains buildings that are compliant with the TC-EPB.
4.1 Corrective actions for the design, implementation, monitoring and 
evaluation of the Project 
107. Action 1 (to UNDP): To improve design of the future CCM projects including any follow-up “building 
energy efficiency” project, the design should include:
• a clear logical framework matrix with SMART indicators and measurable targets that can be 
effectively monitored by PMU staff to reflect progress towards global benefits of energy 
efficiency for residential buildings or any other building sector. This should be developed with 
technical assistance GEF project designers who are familiar with Theory of Change (see Figure 3) 
that more strongly links baselines with project outputs, direct outcomes, intermediate states and 
long-term impacts; 
• a more detailed Project Results Framework (PRF) using the TOC analysis, and with targets that 
are reflected in the project outputs. The achievement of these outputs should be linked and 
contribute to the intended outcomes of the project;

gefeocairopresentationfinal.ppt&usg=AOvVaw3rP1GHRIb0YW2cABRZ8D0g • specific M&E activities that can help project teams focus on specific indicators for monitoring (in 
an improved PRF) that can minimize the workload of the Implementing Partner and the PMU. 
This should include IP and IA access to a functional database of existing and new buildings that 
can provide progress reports on important and relevant metrics such as actual buildings (new 
and existing) with floor area in square metres, and reports from building owners and operators 
on energy consumption, all of which can be easily converted into an SEC value for the building in 
kWh/m2/yr. Entries of this information into the database can easily generate reports that can 
provide cumulative and quantified global benefits; 
• allocation of sufficient resources for capacity building of building owners and operators to 
monitor energy consumption (see Action 5). This may translate into higher M&E budgets for a 
subsequent CCM project in building energy efficiency in Belarus.
108. Action 2 (to UNDP): To improve implementation of future projects similar to IEERB, the PRF 
(strengthened through ToC analysis and ROtI) needs to be used as a guide for preparing project work 
plans. With the various targets that reflect the intended outputs of the project, project personnel 
can formulate work plans by outcome that can then be more effectively managed with output work 
directly contributing to desired outcomes and impacts. 
4.2 Actions to follow up or reinforce initial benefits from the Project 
109. Action 3 (to MoHU with assistance from DEE and UNDP): Continue training workshops in oblast 
training centres to ensure the availability of a critical mass of certified EE building operational 
personnel. This recommendation was made to monitor and mitigate any trends of deterioration of 
the energy performance of EE equipment for these buildings due to lack of knowledge of proper 
maintenance practices. The continuation of these training workshops can strengthen the abilities of 
operational personnel to improve their operation of EE equipment in buildings and their monitoring 
of energy consumption of buildings over the long-term. This would in turn maximize long-term GHG 
emission reductions from EE buildings. 
110. Action 4 (to MoHU with assistance from DEE and UNDP): Set up a program that continually informs 
occupants of EE buildings on optimizing use of their EE systems for hot water, heating and fresh air 
ventilation systems. This recommendation is made based on random interviews with pilot EE building 
occupants who did not demonstrate full understanding on how they could minimize their utility bills. 
This may involve building the technical capacity of the heads of tenant associations in each pilot EE 
building and other EE buildings. 
111. Action 5 (to MoAC with assistance from DEE and UNDP): Continue training programs to ensure the 
availability of a critical mass of building design personnel to enforce compliance to the TC-EPB. 
Similar to Action 3, oblast training centers will deliver these training programs for TC-EPB and 
updates to these building designers and technicians that will provide continuous access to the latest 
best international practices for the design of energy efficiency in buildings. 
4.3 Proposals for future directions underlining main objectives 
112. Action 6 (to DEE and MoHU): Monitor progress of Decree No.1037 of 29.12.2017 on the “Concept of 
Improvement and Development of Housing and Utility Services until 2025” addressing elimination of 
cross-subsidies and upward adjustment of low heating tariff rate towards 50% and higher that should provide sufficient incentives for a shorter cost recovery period to building developers and investors 
for EE measures in residential buildings.
113. Action 7 (to DEE and MoAC): Disseminate monitored energy consumption data from 3 demo buildings 
to the Government policymakers and investors in line with Deputy Prime Minister’s Order No.04/26p 
of July 4, 2017, with more emphasis on the time when the pilot buildings are fully occupied and when 
the tenants have been in their units for a sufficient time during which their energy consumption 
would be normalized; this could be as long as 18-24 months when all units are occupied although 
the currently monitored data are being provided for decision makers. As such, the expected data 
from these 3 pilot buildings should reflect the intended design heating and hot water SEC values in 
the range of 20 to 30 kWh/m2
/yr. Combined with an expected raising of heating tariffs in the order 
of 50%, information on heating energy consumption and its costs to tenants should further catalyze 
investment interest in EE buildings. 
114. Action 8 (to MoNREP): Provide support to appropriate institutions to help formalize protocols and 
methodologies developed by the Project for reporting GHG emission reductions for EE buildings and 
retrofits that includes support to the RUE Belarusian Research Centre “Ecology” to be continued after 
the EOP. Support to the RUE Belarusian Research Centre “Ecology” needs to be continued after the 
EOP as a means of institutionalizing their work on protocols for calculating and reporting GHG 
emission reductions from new buildings as well as retrofits for existing buildings. This work should 
also include a national database on actual energy consumption of buildings of all types, and their 
status of compliance to TC-EPB. 
115. Action 9 (to DEE): Support future retrofit programs or construction of new EE buildings (supported 
either by GoB or donors) through training of building energy operators or managers using experiences 
gained through the Project. Support can be in the form of: 
• Training to ensure capacities of building energy managers, both state personnel (with MoHU) 
and private individuals and companies (ESCOs) reflects latest best practices for operating EE 
systems in buildings including introduction of energy management information systems (EMIS) 
building on UNDP experiences in other countries in the region; 
• Roundtables on a strengthened ESCO modality in Belarus for thermal system installations (if 
deemed appropriate); 
• Upkeep of operational personnel skills that can result in minimized use of fossil-fuel generated 
heat and hot water; and 
• Training on EE building materials as well as targeted research and development on EE building 
materials that can be domestically produced. 
4.4 Best and worst practices in addressing issues relating to relevance, 
performance and success 
116. Best practice: This UNDP Project has been well-managed due to the recruitment of a well-qualified 
project manager with good management skills as well as strong knowledge and technical skill in the 
subject matter. The traits of this Project manager included a strong understanding of the activities of 
the Project, good communication skills, being responsive to all needs of the Project, and a good 
understanding of Belarusian government institutions and technical issues on energy efficiency and climate change. More importantly, the IEERB Project focused on activities that were within the 
control of the Project such as: 
• facilitating good progress on the preparations of ToRs (for design consultants, software 
developers, etc.), tender awards, and the completion of consultant work in an efficient manner; 
and 
• continuing dialogue with multiple partners to sustain their engagement and interest in the IEERB 
Project. 
117. Scope for improved practice: Many country offices including Belarus need assistance in the 
preparation of ProDocs, most notably the Project Results Framework which needs to be focused with 
insertion of SMART indicators that directly contribute to an intended outcome. The PRF could further 
be strengthened through ToC and ROtI analyses with the assistance of personnel from Regional 
Centers. APPENDIX A - MISSION TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR IEERB PROJECT

OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE 
The project was designed to reduce the energy consumption and related GHG emissions with the focus on new 
residential buildings by introducing new performance based building design and construction standards with 
related energy certification scheme(s) and by ensuring their effective implementation and enforcement. By this, the 
energy consumption of new buildings is sought to be cut by at least 70% compared to the existing building stock 
constructed before 1993 and by 40% compared to the buildings erected in accordance with the current construction 
norms and thermal standards in place. The project’s principal outcomes were to support the (i) strengthening of the 
legal and regulatory framework; (ii) training of local experts and other key stakeholders; (iii) construction of three 
EE demo buildings to test and gain practical experience on different EE solutions; and (iv) related outreach and 
dissemination of the lesson learnt. The TE is to cover the entire programme, both the UNDP and the GEF 
components. 
The TE will be conducted according to the guidance, rules and procedures established by UNDP and GEF as 
reflected in the UNDP Evaluation Guidance for GEF Financed Projects. 
The objectives of the evaluation are to assess the achievement of project results, and to draw lessons that can
both improve the sustainability of benefits from this project, and aid in the overall enhancement of UNDP 
programming. 
Improving Energy Efficiency in Residential Buildings in the Republic of BelarusEVALUATION APPROACH AND METHOD 
An overall approach and method37 for conducting project terminal evaluations of UNDP supported GEF financed 
projects has developed over time. The evaluators are expected to frame the evaluation effort using the criteria of 
relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, and impact, as defined and explained in the UNDP Guidance for 
Conducting Terminal Evaluations of UNDP-supported, GEF-financed Projects. A set of questions covering each of 
these criteria have been drafted and are included with this TOR (fill in Annex C). The evaluator is expected to amend, 
complete and submit this matrix as part of an evaluation inception report, and shall include it as an annex to the 
final report. The inception report shall be completed and submitted prior to the evaluation mission to the Republic 
of Belarus. The draft and final evaluation report shall be completed after the evaluation mission to the Republic of 
Belarus. 
The evaluator will assess the following categories of project progress. 
i. Project Strategy 
Project design: 
• Review the problem addressed by the project and the underlying assumptions. Review the effect of any 
incorrect assumptions or changes to the context to achieving the project results as outlined in the Project 
Document. 
• Review the relevance of the project strategy and assess whether it provides the most effective route towards 
expected/intended results. Were lessons from other relevant projects properly incorporated into the project 
design? 
• Review how the project addressed country priorities. Review country ownership. Was the project concept in 
line with the national sector development priorities and plans of the country? 
• Review decision-making processes: were perspectives of those who would be affected by project decisions, 
those who could affect the outcomes, and those who could contribute information or other resources to the 
process, taken into account during project design processes? 
• Review the extent to which relevant gender issues were raised in the project design and if there are major areas 
of concern, recommend areas for improvement. 
Results Framework/Logframe: 
• Undertake a critical analysis of the project’s logframe indicators and targets, assess how “SMART” the midterm 
and end-of-project targets are (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound), and suggest specific 
amendments/revisions to the targets and indicators as necessary. 
• Are the project’s objectives and outcomes or components clear, practical, and feasible within the project 
timeframe? 
• Has the project achieved its global environmental benefits in terms of tonnes of CO2 that have been reduced 
(direct and indirect GHG emissions) as defined in the project document? 
• Examine if progress so far has led to, or could in the future catalyse beneficial development effects (i.e. income 
generation, gender equality and women’s empowerment, improved governance, etc.) that should be included 
in the project results framework and monitored on an annual basis. 
• Ensure broader development and gender aspects of the project are being monitored effectively. Develop and 
recommend SMART ‘development’ indicators, including sex-disaggregated indicators and indicators that 
capture development benefits. 
 
37 For additional information on methods, see the Handbook on Planning, Monitoring and Evaluating for Development Results, 
Chapter 7, pg. 163 ii. Progress Towards Results 
Progress Towards Outcomes Analysis: 
• Review the logframe indicators against progress made towards the end-of-project targets using the Progress 
Towards Results Matrix and colour code the results in a “traffic light system” based on the level of progress 
achieved; assign a rating on progress for each outcome; make recommendations from the areas marked as “Not 
on target to be achieved” (red).

iii. Project Implementation and Adaptive Management 
Management Arrangements: 
• Review overall effectiveness of project management as outlined in the Project Document. Were changes made 
and are they effective? Are responsibilities and reporting lines clear? Is decision-making transparent and 
undertaken in a timely manner? Did the project employ one or more international technical advisors and did 
this help to advance the ability of the project to meet the overall project objective? 
• Review the quality of execution of the Executing Agency/Implementing Partner(s) and recommend areas for 
improvement. 
• Review the quality of support provided by the GEF Partner Agency (UNDP) and recommend areas for 
improvement.

• Review any delays in project implementation, identify the causes and examine if they were resolved. 
• Has the work planning been carried out in a manner which is consistent with the project document and with the
project workplan or are there significant deviations? 
• Were work-planning processes results-based? If not, suggest ways to re-orientate work planning to focus on 
results. 
• Examine the use of the project’s results framework/ logframe as a management tool and review any changes 
made to it since project start. 
iv. Mid-Term Review 
• Examine the extent to which the recommendations from the mid-term review have been taken into account by 
the project and the extent to which the project has successfully carried out adaptive management in a timely 
manner following the mid-term review; 
• Examine the extent to which, if mid-term review recommendations were not taken into account, the reasons 
why these recommendations were not taken into account, discuss, and analyse the reasons why as well as the 
impact that this has had on the overall success of the project. 
The evaluation must provide evidence-based information that is credible, reliable and useful. The evaluator is 
expected to follow a participatory and consultative approach ensuring close engagement with government 
counterparts, in particular the GEF operational focal point, UNDP Country Office, project team, UNDP GEF Regional 
Technical Adviser based in Istanbul and other key stakeholders. 
The evaluator is expected to spend 10 working days (not including travel or weekends) in the Republic of Belarus, as 
part of this assignment. 
The international evaluator is expected to conduct a field mission to each of the demonstration pilot projects 
including Minsk, Mahilioŭ and Hrodna, i.e., the following project sites: (i) Standard one-entrance 19-storey 133-
apartment large-panel residential house with 9.42 thousand square meters of living area; (ii) Standard four-entrance 
10-storey 180-apartment semi-frame panel residential house with total living area of 13.89 thousand square meters; 
(iii) Standard three-entrance 10-storey 120-apartment residential house being constructed of brick partition 
crosswalls with the outer walls made of foam concrete blocks and with total living area of 10.34 thousand square 
meters. 
The mission is expected to start and end in Minsk and have the following estimated breakdown: 2 days in Minsk 
followed by 2 days in Mahilioŭ (including travel) followed by 2 days in Hrodno (including travel) followed by 4 days 
in Minsk meaning that the 10 days are made up of 2+2+2+4 = 10 working days. Weekends should not be counted as 
working days meaning that working days are Monday-Friday only which means that the evaluation mission should 
be for a period of 2 weeks. This tentative breakdown can be changed provided that the overall number of days spent
in the Republic of Belarus stays at 10 working days. 
In the event, that it is agreed between the UNDP project manager and the international and national evaluators it 
might be possible to split the mission into 2 missions, provided that the total number of days remains at 10 working 
days (not including travel days). Example: International Evaluator decides to undertake 1 mission of 7 working days
(not including weekends) and one mission of 3 working days. 
Interviews will be held with the following organizations and individuals at a minimum: (i) Project Manager, other 
project staff members and key experts; (ii) UNDP CO Programme Analysts and the UNDP Istanbul Regional Hub 
Regional Technical Advisor on Climate Change Mitigation; (iii) Energy Efficiency Department of State Standardization 
Committee as the national implementing agency; (iv) Ministry of Architecture & Construction; (v) Ministry of Housing 
& Communal Services; (vi) RUE “Institute of Housing – NIPTIS after S. Ataev”; (vii) MAPID JSC; (viii) RUE “GrodnoGrazhdanProject Institute”; (ix) GrodnoZhylStroy LLC; (x) Unitary Enterprise “Mahilioŭ sky UKS”; (xi) RUE 
“StrojTechNorm”; (xii) chairmen of Associations of Owners of houses in Minsk and Hrodna; (xiii) Belarus National 
Technical University – Construction and Energy Faculties. The evaluation team is encouraged to request additional 
interviews, so the team should thereby meet with additional key stakeholders during the mission to Republic of 
Belarus. 
The evaluator will review all relevant sources of information, such as the project document, project reports – 
including Annual APR/PIR, project budget revisions, midterm review, progress reports, GEF focal area tracking tools, 
project files, national strategic and legal documents, and any other materials that the evaluators consider useful for 
this evidence-based assessment. A list of documents that the project team will provide to the evaluators for review 
is included in Annex B of this Terms of Reference. 
EVALUATION CRITERIA & RATINGS 
An assessment of project performance will be carried out, based against expectations set out in the Project Logical
Framework/Results Framework (see Annex A), which provides performance and impact indicators for project
implementation along with their corresponding means of verification. The evaluation will cover, at a minimum, the 
criteria of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability and impact. Ratings must be provided on the following 
performance criteria. The completed table must be included in the evaluation executive summary. The obligatory 
rating scales are included in Annex D.

PROJECT FINANCE / COFINANCE 
The Evaluation will assess the key financial aspects of the project, including the extent of co-financing planned and 
realized. Project cost and funding data will be required, including annual expenditures. Variances between 
planned and actual expenditures will need to be assessed and explained. 
Specifically, the final evaluation will: 
• Consider the financial management of the project, with specific reference to the cost-effectiveness of 
interventions, as they were carried out. 
• Review the changes to fund allocations as a result of budget revisions and assess the appropriateness and 
relevance of such revisions. 
• Review whether the project has had the appropriate financial controls, including reporting and planning, that 
allow management to make informed decisions regarding the budget and allow for timely flow of funds. 
• Provide detailed inputs to the co-financing monitoring table to be filled out, provide commentary on cofinancing: has the co-financing been used strategically to help the objectives of the project? Has the Project
Team met with all co-financing partners regularly in order to align financing priorities and annual work plans? Results from recent financial audits, as available, should be taken into consideration. The evaluator(s) will receive 
assistance from the Country Office (CO) and Project Team to obtain financial data in order to complete the cofinancing table below, which will be included in the terminal evaluation report. 
MAINSTREAMING 
UNDP supported GEF financed projects are key components in UNDP country programming, as well as regional and 
global programmes. The evaluation will assess the extent to which the project was successfully mainstreamed with 
other UNDP priorities, including poverty alleviation, improved governance, the prevention and recovery from 
natural disasters, and gender. 
IMPACT 
The evaluators will assess the extent to which the project is achieving impacts or progressing towards the 
achievement of impacts. Key findings that should be brought out in the evaluations include whether the project 
has demonstrated: a) verifiable improvements in ecological status, b) verifiable reductions in stress on ecological 
systems, and/or c) demonstrated progress towards these impact achievements.43 
CONCLUSIONS, RECOMMENDATIONS & LESSONS 
The evaluation report must include a chapter providing a set of conclusions, recommendations and lessons 
learned. It is suggested that the number of recommendations does not exceed 15 in total. 
IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS 
The principal responsibility for managing this evaluation resides with the UNDP CO in the Republic of Belarus. The 
UNDP CO will contract the evaluators. The Project Team will be responsible for liaising with the evaluation team to 
set up stakeholder interviews, arrange field visits, coordinate with the Government etc. 
EVALUATION TIMEFRAME 
The total duration of the evaluation will be 40 days, over a 4-month period from 1st February 2018 to 30th June

Summary 
Why low incentives are referred to here as a reason for difficulties of assessing the reduction of energy consumptioGHG emissions? The assessment should be based on the preproject baseline and the resulting achievements in the courthe Project.

Summary 
I think that this conclusion is not entirely correct. Yes, the pibuildings were put in operation in Dec 2016 – May 2017, anexperience of only one (the first) heating season does not pcorrect energy performance data. On the other hand: (i) the monitoring data of the first season, while being slightly wor(and this was actually foreseen) than the expected data of afuture season, show nevertheless the results that corresponquite well with the designed data; (ii) these results are institutionalized since the Project and its partners have to pthe monitoring data every month in line with the Order of J2017 No.04/26p by the Deputy Prime Minister initiated by tProject; and (iii) there is an assignment in that Order given NIPTIS by the Government to continue the said monitoring u2020 under the upcoming state programmes.

UNFCCC Secretariat……the arrangement, however, has not been formalized and aligned with the calculations for GHG emission reductions for the IEERB Project”, I think we should 
avoid making such assumptions as you make here. What shall we do with the fact that the IPCC guidelines for emission calculations (that were a formal and proven basis the Project’s report “A methodology for calculating greenhogas emissions for a system for monitoring the energy efficieresidential buildings. Estimating the amount of expected greenhouse gas emissions from the operation of the three pbuildings”) do not correspond with the “universal” (simplifieGEF methodology used in Para 63? Instead, we should be comfortable with IPCC methodology used in the Project’s prfor CO2 emission reduction calculation. When you say abouformalization, what way of formalization do you mean? To formalize the IPCC guidelines? To formalize the correspondiBelarusian standard (TKP 17.09-01-2011 – “Methodology foestimating GHG emissions through the implementation of esaving measures, non-traditional and renewable energy sources”)?

In general, I am fine with your recent reduction of para 92. recall again Output 4.3. It says: “Fully mandated and capacstate agency with a responsibility to monitor the … CO2 emreductions in residential and other buildings, together with agreed procedures and interagency agreements for compilirequired primary data.”  1) The fully mandated and capacitated relevant state aghas been established. This agency is used to provide monitoof GHG emissions from all sectors in line with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.  2) The above IPCC Guidelines prescribes three levels of Gemission calculation methodologies for all UNFCCC Annex I Parties: (i) IPCC methodology, which is a required protocol fsuch Parties and for all sectors; (ii) country specific methodowhich is a voluntary protocol for some sector(s) selected as Party’s discretion; and (iii) country specific methodology, wa voluntary protocol for some specific sources of emissions fsector(s) selected as to Party’s discretion.  3) IPCC is not to standardize the country specific methodologies under levels (ii) or (iii) and is not to include smethodologies in its Guidelines. IPCC even does not care whsuch methodologies are adopted (standardized) on nationaor not. Instead, case-by-case, the IPCC Expert Facility while reviewing the Party’s reporting (e.g., National CommunicatNational GHG Cadaster) examines and verifies the results of calculations and the methodology (other than (i)) on which calculations are based.  4) The project, based on its results, elaborated “Methodfor calculation of greenhouse gas emissions from housing”, is a country specific methodology of level (iii) and does not contradict with generalized IPCC methodology of level (i), aproject would like this document to become a national stan Thus, the project fully responded to Output 4.3.
