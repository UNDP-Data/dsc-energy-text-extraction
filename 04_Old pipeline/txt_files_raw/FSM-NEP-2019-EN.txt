The FSM is fully committed to the mandates of sustainability.
This is most especially true when we talk about about energy, both in how it is acquired and how it is
used. As a nation and as a people, we must remain focused on the broadening of the energy base
and toward a reduction in our dependence on outside sources of energy. If we are to achieve the
long-term goals laid out in our National Strategic Development Plan, the energy that powers our
economic and social aspirations of self-reliance must be affordable, reliable and above all, clean.
Not only our people and governments, but our utilities – the very foundation of our fledgling
economies – require that we proactively address the energy issue on a number of levels, especially
for electricity and transportation. The rising cost of fuel, combined with the global economic
recession has severely impacted the utilities’ ability to provide reliable electricy. Add to this the
rising cost of equipment and essential supplies needed by our four state utilities, and we can see the
seeds of long-term financial insolvency of most, if not all of them.
This has a multiplier effect on the rest of society. Families and businesses all feel the crunch. This is
why the time is now to improve operational and consumer efficiencies, working toward lowering fuel
prices by all means possible, increasing revenues across the board, and perhaps most important,
increasing our use of renewable energy when and where possible.
The challenges are great, but so too are the possibilities. They are numerous, and this Energy Policy – a first for the nation – is the tool by which we will move forward into an era of enhanced
alternative energy use throughout society: in governments, in communities, at our schools and
health centers, and within the private sector and business community.
I remain committed to leading the way; for the FSM to become a leader in the application of
economically sound and technically proven alternative means; in the use of renewable energy, in the
implementation of energy efficiency measures and in the promulgation of incentives and regulations
that support these aims. We can and must make this happen.
Let us work together to make it a reality.

PREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The leadership of the Federated States of Micronesia acknowledged the need for the development of a
National Energy Policy and Action Plans that would assist the Nation in becoming less dependent on fossil fuel
and more prepared to withstand the heavily fluctuating energy prices that nearly lead the FSM into a national
emergency in 2008. The development of this national policy started in July 2008 when the nation’s leaders
endorsed a resolution during the Chief Executive Council meeting held in Kosrae State to develop a national
energy policy and have national and state actions plans included. After this initial meeting, the State Governors
selected the members of the respective State Energy Workgroups and the National Government established
the National Energy Workgroup. During the first few weeks of the development of the energy policy, several
workshops and consultations were held and a rough draft policy was presented to the President in July 2009.
After the draft was considered by the National Government and the four State Governors, the Energy Division
of the Department of Resources and Development started a new round of consultations to the four FSM states.
The final development of the policy with the various action plans started in January 2010 with as objective to
have a policy ready for endorsement by May 2010, with workable and realistic goals and objectives for the
National Government as well as for the FSM States. The policy contains two Volumes; Volume I covers the
overarching policy, while Volume II contains the energy action plans. The development and finalization of the
policy and action plans was completed with considerable effort by many people from the national government
as well as from the four FSM states.
The efforts of the following individuals and groups are greatly appreciated: ; H.E. Emmanuel Mori, President of the Federated States of Micronesia, for his endless support and
personal interest throughout the development of the policy; ; Governor Robert Weilbacher, Kosrae State; Governor John Ehsa, Pohnpei State; Governor Wesley
Semina, Chuuk State; Governor Sebastian Anafel, Yap State, for their support; ; FSM Congressman Peter Christian, Former Secretary of the Department of Resources and
Development for his wisdom, patience and strong support during the development of the policy; ; Director Andrew Yatilman, Office of Environment and Emergency Management; ; The European Union for assisting the initial development of this policy and the action plan through the
9th European Development Funds’ REP-5 Pacific energy program; ; The Asian Development Bank for supporting the development of the energy policy; ; The private sector, state and national governments, College of Micronesia and NGO participants at a
July 2008 workshop who actively and enthusiastically considered a wide range of strengths,
weaknesses, opportunities and threats regarding energy issues in the FSM; ; The National and State Energy Workgroups who actively participated in the overall development of
the policy and action plans; ; Mr.Maderson Ramon, former Asst. Secretary, Department of R&D, Energy Division for starting and
supporting the development of the energy policy; ; Marieke Kleemans and Peter Konings for their guidance, and professionalism during the development
of the national energy policy and action plans.

2. POLICY SUMMARY
2.1 GENERAL
FSM is highly dependent on imported
petroleum fuels to sustain its economy.
Petroleum fuels are used for both electricity
generation and transportation with the former
being the major user. In 2008, the FSM
Petroleum Corporation (PetroCorp) was
established in a combined effort to achieve
greater economies of scale and currently
serves all four FSM states; PetroCorp is a
wholly government-owned enterprise. The
impacts of the high fuel prices of 2008 have
resulted in the rise in the costs of goods and
services in FSM.
The Nation currently expends approximately
40 million dollars annually on imported fuel.
This amount represents more than 50% of the
aggregate sectoral grants that the Nation
receives from the US Government under the
Compact II Treaty, and nearly 20 percent of
nominal GDP for the country, marking energy
as a priority need and the most costly sector
of its fragile economy.
Biomass in the form of wood and coconut
husk products are used for local cooking and
in most outer island communities, biomass is
the primary energy source. Renewable energy
sources are being introduced in the outer
islands and in the State Centers. PV solar
energy is being accepted as a sustainable and
economically viable source of energy
nationwide, while Pohnpei has hydro energy
potentials; Kosrae is looking at wave energy;
Yap is looking at wind power, and Chuuk at
bio-fuels to broaden the nations’ energy mix.
The Strategic Development Plan (SDP) for FSM
provides a road map for social and economic
development for the next 20 years (2004 – 2023). The SDP has four main objectives:
1. Stability and Security—to maintain
economic assistance at levels that
support macroeconomic stability.
Achievement of this objective required
levels of funding close to prevailing levels
to avoid the large periodic step-downs in
funding that were a characteristic of the
first 15-year funding package.
2. Improved Enabling Environment for
Economic Growth—to be achieved
through the FSM commitment to
economic reform and the provision of an
enabling environment to support open,
outward-oriented and private sector led
development.
3. Improved Education and Health Status—
the third objective concerned the use of
the annual Compact grants to support the
provision of basic services in education
and health.
4. Assured Self-Reliance and Sustainability —to be achieved through the
establishment of a Trust Fund that would,
after a period of time, replace the annually
appropriated transfers from the US.
Energy is an integral component of the SDP
and this is clearly noted in all fourobjectives
mentioned above, particularly when one
considers abundantly available renewable
sources. To achieve economic stability and
security requires a vibrant energy sector, and
the necessary energy infrastructure to
promote economic and social development in
both the State Centers and Out-lying Islands is
of high priority. Equally, education and health
services deliveries are contingent on the
quality of energy infrastructure and services
available.
The Energy Policy has been developed based
on four primary components. These are Policy and Planning, Conventional
Energy (fossil fuel), Energy Efficiency &
Conservation, and Renewable Energy.10 | P a g e
Within these main components the policy
seeks to achieve these goals:
1. An effective, coordinated, resilient
and dynamic joint State and National
energy sector;
2. A safe, reliable, cost-effective and
sustainable energy supply;
3. An efficient, responsive and
competitive energy sector;
4. A diversified energy resource base,
creating a balanced energy mix; and
5. The environmentally sound and
efficient use of energy.
2.2 VISION STATEMENT, OBJECTIVES AND GOALS
The National Vision statement for Energy is:
To improve the life and livelihood of all FSM
citizens with affordable, reliable and
environmentally sound energy.
The National Objective for Energy is:
To promote the sustainable social and
economic development of FSM through the
provision and utilization of cost-effective,
safe, reliable and sustainable energy services.
Whereas energy services refer to work
relating to the sale, supply, storage and
distribution of energy.
The Major Goal of the Policy is:
To become less dependent on imported
sources of energy by having (1) an increased
share of renewable energy sources and
having (2) cross-sectoral energy conservation
and (3) efficiency standards in place; and
therefore,
By 2020 the share of renewable energy
sources will be at least 30% of total energy
production, while electricity efficiency will
increase by 50%. Energy Efficiency referred
here would also mean reduction of energy
loss.
In addition, the following broad goals relate to
energy services in the FSM:
- Provision of affordable and safe electricity
to all the households in the main island
centers by 2015
- Electrification of 80% of rural public
facilities by 2015
- Electrification of 90% of rural households
by 2020
- Enhance the supply side energy efficiency
of the FSM utilities by 20% by 2015
2.3 OVERALL ASPIRATION
In line with the above stated objective, vision
and major goal, the National Energy Policy has
indentified the following focal areas:
 Disadvantaged and/or Geographically
Remote Communities
- Encourage the application of appropriate
support and incentives to enable
disadvantaged and/or geographically
remote communities to access affordable
energy.11 | P a g e
 Capacity Building
- Improve adequate and institutional
capacity to plan, manage, and develop the
energy sector by providing appropriate
energy-related training opportunities at all
educational and professional levels.
- Accelerate research and development of
energy technologies that are appropriate
for adoption within the nation and
facilitate international transfers of
appropriate technologies that the nation
is capable of operating and maintaining.
- Assess and promote indigenous resource
potential and technical capacity for all
aspects of energy sector planning and
development.
 Public Awareness
- Increase training and public awareness on
renewable energy and fuels for vehicles,
energy efficiency, and conservation
through publicity campaigns and school
curricula.
 Private Sector Involvement
- Enhance public-private partnerships and
expand private sector participation,
investment, ownership, and management
for energy supply including electricity
generation, transmission and distribution
with job creation in mind.
- Establish an enabling and competitive
environment for the introduction of
independent energy providers where
these may provide efficient, reliable, and
affordable service to consumers.
 Community Level initiatives
- Promote involvement and input from non- government organizations and local
communities, including youth and women,
in policy implementation and integrated
planning.12 | P a g e
CHAPTER II: NATIONAL CONTEXT AND ENERGY OVERVIEW
Figure 2: Structure of the policy
1. COUNTRY OVERVIEW
In 1986 the Federated States of Micronesia was created and gained independence from its former
administrator, the United States. Five years after the birth of the nation, the FSM joined the United
Nations in 1991 (GoFSM, 1997).1 From west to east, it stretches about 2,700 kilometers, and is
located in the western Pacific Ocean between the equator and 14 degrees North latitude (Figure 2). With a total population of 107,000, there are four states in the FSM – Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei and
Kosrae. Each State maintains considerable autonomy for their own development strategy, while the
national government provides an integrated prospective and vision, which is described in the FSM
National Development Plan (GoFSM, 1997). Except for Kosrae, each state consists of a State center,
which is often the largest island, and a multitude of outer islands. The FSM has a total of 607
islands, 74 of which are inhabited.

which is often the largest island, and a multitude of outer islands. The FSM has a total of 607
islands, 74 of which are inhabited.
1 This section builds heavily on GoFSM, 199713 | P a g e
1.1 GEOGRAPHY
The islands in general can be categorized into
two types of landscape. The state centers of
Pohnpei, Chuuk Lagoon and Kosrae are high
volcanic islands with steep and rugged
uplands. Most outer islands and the State
center of Yap are low coral atolls and
characterized by gently sloping uplands
surrounded by swampy lowlands. Due to
agro-forestry or secondary vegetation, the
natural upland forests, which once covered
the islands, are disappearing fast.
Today, sizeable forest areas can only be found
on the islands of Pohnpei and Kosrae (GoFSM,
1997).
Inside the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), the
marine area of the FSM, which accounts for
over 2.6 million square kilometers, has
abundant and diverse resources. While the
nation consists of 607 islands, its land area
totals only 701 square kilometers. Besides the
natural environment, cultures also vary
considerably between islands. After
thousands of years since the settlement of the
islands, there are significant environmental
and cultural differences involved even within
the four states of FSM. It is thus that the
natural environment and especially the
marine and the land resources have a
profound and vital influence in shaping the
physical and cultural life of the inhabitants
(GoFSM, 1997).
Figure 3: Map of the Federated States of Micronesia
1.2 DEMOGRAPHY
Between 1989 and 1994, FSM has experienced
an internal migration. With a 10 percent
increase in total population during this period,
the population share of Pohnpei, where the
capital is located, increased by 13 percent, as
people immigrated to seek economic
opportunity. On the other hand, Kosrae’s
share of the population only increased slightly, by 4 percent. In spite of the internal
movement, the overall population structure of
FSM remains the same, and the population of
FSM remains one of the youngest in the
region, with almost 24 percent of the
population under 24 years of age. Similar to
other parts of the world, the median age of
the population has increased, rising from 16 to
18 over the last 30 years. The average
population density in 1994 was 150 persons
per square kilometer. However, this overall
figure might be misleading, as the population
density varies considerably across the nation,
ranging from 418 per square kilometer in
Chuuk to a low of 63 per square kilometer in
Kosrae (GoFSM, 1997).14 | P a g e
1.3 CLIMATE
The FSM has a typical tropical climate: stable
temperature, high humidity and high rainfall.
The temperature averages between mid 20
and 30 degrees Celsius, while the humidity is
on average over 80 percent. Rainfall is in
general high, but varies geographically, with a
low record of 3 meters on drier islands to over
10 meters per year in the mountainous
interior of Pohnpei. As with many tropical
islands, there is a wet season (June to
October) and dry season (November to May)
in FSM. Occasionally, the western region of
the country suffers from typhoons (one in 20
years return period), which can cause serious
damage to the region such as landslides and
devastation of vegetation, buildings and
infrastructure (GoFSM, 1997).
1.4 ECONOMY
The FSM is a small and domestic-based
economy with a market of 107,000 people
(SBOC, 2009) with modest income (GoFSM,
1997). The Nominal Gross Domestic Product
of the FSM in 2006 was $236.9 million. Per
capita GDP for 2006 was $2,194. The trade
balance has remained highly negative since
1997. In 2005, the trade balance was
estimated at negative $117.2 million, an
equivalent to 50.5 percent of GDP (DoI, 2006,
pp. 198).
The economy of the FSM is mainly determined
by agriculture, including fishing and every
related aspect to this (such as the lease of
fishing rights to FSM waters), government
employment and tourism. In the period 1997- 2005 the number of visitor arrivals grew with
almost 10 percent. In 2005, 18,958 people
visited the FSM. Most of the visitors were
from the US and Japan, about 40 percent and
17 percent, respectively, in 2005 (DoI, 2006,
pp. 198).
The infrastructure is under-developed and
cannot meet the demands of the growing
population and the condition of the
infrastructure is poorly maintained due to
severe limitations on the availability of
government local revenue funds (GoFSM,
1997).
SECTORAL DEVELOPMENT
Except for the offshore fisheries, there
limited resources in the FSM. Except for the
wholesale/retail and service industries, the
private sector is under-developed and the
FSM has a large external trade deficit. The
country is very dependent on external aid and
on the public sector for providing jobs and
government expenditure. In the FSM National
Development Plan (SDP), the government
acknowledged the distinct dichotomy
between the cash and traditional economies
(GoFSM, 1997). The commercial sector is
characterized primarily by small businesses, with only a few larger public companies, co- operatives and credit unions. Most of the
family-based businesses focus on commercial
import/export, wholesale and retail business.
Alternatively, the families might also engage in
small service enterprises, such as restaurants,
taxis, car rentals, repair and maintenance, etc.
Only a few have ventured into the industrial
sector (GoFSM, 1997). Thus the FSM economy is dominated by the
public sector as the primary sector of
economic activity. The government provides
one third of total employment, while the
agriculture and fisheries industries together
account for 28 percent of the jobs.15 | P a g e
14,400 persons are estimated to be involved
in the cash economy, and half of them are
engaged in the public sector, mainly operating
public facilities, engaging in construction work
(through government infrastructure projects)
as well as supporting community services. As
the public wage in general is considered to be
significantly higher than the comparable work
in the private sector, this has suffocated the
entrepreneurial growth and technical skills
development which could in fact help to
increase the efficiency of production and
export service sectors of the economy. The
scattered consumer markets and the lack of
adequate transportation infrastructure have
contributed to the minimal trade between
states. Agricultural products are the primary
goods traded within FSM, as well as for
export, with sakau (kava), betelnut and citrus
being some of the primary products (GoFSM,
1997).
FINANCIAL TRANSFERS FROM THE US
Economic development in the FSM needs to
be analyzed in the context of the Compact
Agreement with the United States, as it is
heavily dependent on the financial assistance
provided under the Compact of Free
Association (DoI, 2006, pp. 198). The Compact
since 1986 has provided large external
financial transfers to support the operations
of the Government of the FSM and substantial
public sector investment at the State level. Compact economic assistance, initially meant
to last 15 years until 2001, was characterized
by reductions in grant funding of 15 percent
after 5 years and 22 percent after 10 years.
Transfers were partly indexed to United
States’ inflation, resulting in an overall
average real decline in resource flows of 4
percent per year. The Compact was extended
for a further two years through fiscal year
2003 during renegotiations (DoI, 2006).
The Compact was designed to assist the FSM
with infrastructure and development of its
economy. Infrastructure development had
been successful but the development of a self
sustaining economy had only very limited
success. Roads, electric utilities, harbors,
airports, schools, hospitals and public facilities
were all constructed during the 15 years of
Compact I. Kosrae, Pohnpei and Yap have
maintained their facilities in a responsible
manner and have expanded their facilities.
Chuuk has not performed as well (DoI, 2006,
pp. 198).
In 2003 the United States and FSM entered
into an Amended Compact II agreement,
wherein FSM receives payments of $92.7
million per year from the United States with
$76.2 million being in the form of grants and
$16.0 million to be placed in a trust fund and
$500,000 allocated each year for an annual
audit. The trust fund is expected to increase
and become a permanent interest-bearing
fund such that after Compact II expires in
2023 the trust fund will provide the same level
of income available to FSM as the present
Compact II (DoI, 2006, pp. 198). However,
current financial trends indicate that the FSM
Trust Fund will not provide such funding
required after 2023, when the current
Compact ends.16 | P a g e
Figure 4: Real GDP growth in FSM 1997-2007
(Source:http://www.spc.int/prism/country/fm/stats/Eco
nomic/NAacc't/gdp-summary.htm)
Already at the start of Independence in 1987
the economy depended strongly on Compact
flows, representing 88 percent of the
country’s gross domestic product (GDP).
Because the non-traded goods production
dominated the private sector, the export
volume was negligible and the tourism sector
was still in its early stage. From then onwards,
GDP grew 1.6 percent annually and the private
sector realized an average rate of growth of
2.9 percent annually (Figure 3). Although this
is not very high, it is comparable to the
economic performance of other Pacific Island
countries.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
The FSM is classified as a medium income
country by World Bank categorization and by
the UNDP as a country in the medium Human
Development Index category. The FSM scores
moderately on other development indicators.
In 2003, the ADB concluded the following for
the FSM in relation with meeting the
Millennium Development Goals (MDG):
“Shows little progress towards meeting the
MDGs by 2015. Poverty incidence isestimated
to be high with approximately 40 percent of
the population falling below the national
poverty line in 1998 and there are signs of
increasing inequalities. One of the key issues
is delivery of basic social services, which often
fail to reach the poorer strata of society, the
outer islands and rural areas. There are
significant differences in the poverty situation
between the various states but little
disaggregated data is available. FSM not only
faces the challenge of increasing enrollment
rates at all levels but also of improving the
quality of education, retention rates and
access in the outer islands. FSM has poor
health indicators.
Although maternal mortality rates have fallen
significantly, FSM still has a relatively high
maternal mortality rate and a rapidly
increasing incidence of non-communicable
diseases. Child mortality rates have decreased
slightly. Available data suggest that only 41
percent of the population has access to an
improved water source and about 45 percent
to improved sanitation” (ADB, 2003). DEVELOPMENT OF STATES
There is considerable autonomy for the States
in the FSM and there are also large
differences. As shown in Table 1 Pohnpei,
with the national government, accounts for
only 32 percent of FSM’s population but 47
percent of GDP. Chuuk, with half of the
population has 28 percent of GDP. Economic
performance has varied considerable, partly
reflecting differences in policies and responses
to external developments. Pohnpei and Yap
grew the most rapidly at 0.5 and 1.1 percent
respectively per annum from 1987-2007.

Table 1: Percentage of Population and GDP per state,
2007 (Source: SBOC, 2009)
The economy of Kosrae is limited. In 2005 the
average income per household in Kosrae was
$12,842, which is 4.3 percent below the
national average. However, the average
expenditure per household was $11,778
which is 8.2 percent less than the national
average. Kosrae is the only State in which the
median savings is positive. The 2006 Gross
Domestic Product was $15.9 million, a decline
of 3.3 percent compared to 2005 when
inflation is considered. The 2007 GDP per
capita was $1,963 (DoI, 2006, p. 196).
Pohnpei has the highest amount of average
savings at $2,658, which is 450 percent of the
national average savings. The median savings
are minus $192, which is more than $2,000
more compared to the national average and
almost $4,000 more than in Yap. The average
income per household is $15,593, the highest
of the four states. It is almost 43 percent
higher than the average income in Chuuk,
which has the lowest of the country. The
2006 GDP was $94.3 million, a decline of 0.2
percent related to 2005. With a 2007 GDP per
capita of $2,685, Pohnpei was 47 percent
above the national GDP per capita (DoI, 2006,
p. 197).
The average and median income of Chuuk is
very low, respectively 18 and 36 percent
below the national average. The average
savings is approximately $1,000 lower than
the national average. However, the median
savings is $300 above the national average.
This is due to the fact that the median
expenditure in Chuuk is only 67 percent of the
national median expenditure. The GDP per
capita in 2007 was $1,006 which is 55 percent
of the national GDP per capita and 67 percent
less than Yap, the State with the highest GDP
per capita (DoI, 2006, p. 197).
Chuuk has suffered from several financial
crises and has not yet made the adjustments
necessary to repay debts, which were
equivalent to 30 percent of state GDP at the
height of the crisis in FY1996. Large inflows of
funds to assist Chuuk recover from Typhoon
Chata’an in 2003 helped stimulate economic
growth (PIREP, 2004).
The Yap economy has declined slightly in
recent years since Compact II began but is
stronger than some other FSM states. Yap has
developed a relatively strong private sector
employment base with approximately 72
percent of employees in the private sector.
Yap State’s economy continues to be
dominated by government spending, both for
wages and the purchase of goods and services
from the private sector.
The closure of a garment factory eliminated
the manufacturing sector. Tourism is down
significantly after the reduction of scheduled
flights by one-third (DoI, 2006).18 | P a g e
As mentioned before, Yap has the highest GDP
per capita, $3,034 in 2007. The average
income per household is also the highest of
the four States, with $15,616. It is 16 percent
above the national average and a massive 43
percent above the average in Chuuk. Despite
the high average income, the average and
median savings are the lowest in the country.
This is due to the high Consumer Price Index in
Yap. The average expenditure is 38 percent
above the national average. The GDP dropped
by 6.5 percent in the period 2005-2006 to
$36.2 million (PIREP, 2004). Employment in
Yap State dropped from 3,680 in 2001 to
3,023 in 2004. Average mean income in 2004
was $6,605. In 2006, the real GDP was
estimated to be $36.2 million (DoI, 2006, p.
197).19 | P a g e
2. ENERGY SECTOR
The energy sector in FSM is overwhelmingly
dependent on the import of petroleum fuels
for commercial energy use for transport,
electricity, business and households.
Hydropower has been a minor contributor as
the Nanpil hydro system (Pohnpei) has
provided several percent of the total
electricity supply. Current problems with the
dam have reduced this share. Other sources of
renewable energy, such as solar energy and
bio-energy account for a minor percent of the
energy supply (PIREP, 2004, p.14). This section
will first give a brief overview of the use of
conventional energy, including the sources
and its use, after which the largest part of this
section will focus on renewable energy, where
the greatest potential for expansion exists. 2.1 ENERGY DEMAND
2.1.1 HOUSEHOLDS
Roughly 55% of all households in FSM had
electrification from some source (2000
census) (Table 2).Chuuk Yap Pohnpei Kosrae

75% 100% 98% 98%

(2009 estimate)
46% 70% 87% 100%
Table 2: Household electrification figures
It shows that some alternative solutions are
being used in some states that provide
electricity (mainly PV and diesel generators).
The energy demand in the rural areas
generally corresponds to basic needs such as
lighting (often with kerosene, oil lamps, flashlights) and cooking (wood or other
biomass (coconut-husk) and some kerosene).
No specific statistical study has been carried
out on the energy use habits and expenditures
in rural places. However, on the basis of a
survey conducted during the course of the
REP-5 implementation in 2009, the average
can be estimated around $15 to $35 per
month and per household (in the outer islands
around $15 (depends on availability) while in
the rural areas on the main islands the
average is $ 35). Besides lighting, kerosene is also used for
cooking, but its consumption at the national
level has dropped mostly in rural areas and
replaced by traditional wood and charcoal fuel
sources. This can be largely attributed to the
increase in fuel costs and the decrease in rural
household incomes.
2.2 PETROLEUM /
CONVENTIONAL ENERGY
Foremost as the primary source of energy for
the FSM is petroleum. The use of energy in
the FSM is comparable to the energy use in
other tropical islands in the sense that the
majority of petroleum is used for electricity
generation and for transportation (DoI, 2006,
pp. 209). More specifically, gasoline and
diesel fuel are mainly used for transportation
purposes and diesel is used for the generators
at the utilities.
Furthermore, a small amount of liquid
petroleum gas (LPG) is used for heating water
and cooking (DoI, 2006, pp. 197).
In the transportation sector, mainly gasoline
and diesel are used. Because the FSM does
not have a large land mass, the use of fuel for
vehicle transportation is modest.
Transportation fuel is therefore mostly used
for marine services, including commercial
fishing boats, patrol boats and the cargo and
passenger ships within the nation. Many use
fuel from Pohnpei, which has emerged as the
‘fleet headquarters’ of the region and others
use fuel tenders on the open ocean.
For cooking, kerosene and liquid petroleum
gases (LPG) are used, as well as wood and
coconut waste (DoI, 2006, pp. 198).20 | P a g e
In 2009, around $40 million US$, which is
comparable to over 50% of the national
budget, was spent on the import of fossil fuel.
Since world oil prices and the demand for oil
continue to rise, this number will only
increase. Recent history indicates major
nation-wide hardships due to such trends.
The average price for a barrel of oil was just
above $50 in January 2007. In October 2007
the price reached almost $90 a barrel, causing
the price to increase by 80 percent. The
following year, in April 2008, the price
increased to $110, causing what amounted to
a full-blown fuel crisis in the Summer of 2008
in the FSM (GoFSM, 2008a).
Table 3 shows the price summary of fuel and
electricity costs in the US.

At that time, the cost for fuel for the nations’
four Utilities to keep the generators running
was up to 91 percent of total revenue
collections, leaving no financial reserve for
maintenance and system improvement.
Subsequent steep and sudden fuel and energy
prices to consumers created pockets of the
population that could no longer afford to have
the convenience of electricy or transport on
the main islands.21 | P a g e
Beyond the traditionally steep increase of the
price for electricity and fuel caused by an
over-dependence on fossil fuel, other aspects
of socio-economic progress also become
problematic, particularly in regard to the
overall commensurate increase in the
Consumer Price Index. All goods and services
become more expensive. Therefore, even
people who are not connected to the
electricity grid will suffer from the price
increase of fuel (GoFSM, 2008a). This
hampers development and fosters inequality
as it disproportionally harms the poorer
segments of the society. Because of this, the
development of renewable energy and energy
efficiency are key elements in preventing this
scenario. Although oil prices have cooled
considerably from the high in the Summer of
2008, the latest trends show that oil prices are
once again on the upswing, bringing even
more pressure on the FSM people and the
utility corporations, most of which are still
dealing with the last oil price spike.
Figure 5: WTI crude oil price (Source Short-Term Energy
Outlook, February 2010)
Electricity use can be divided into five main
categories: residential use (39 percent),
commercial and industrial use (22 percent),
use by the government (17 percent), use for
utilities (10 percent) and losses of the system
(12 percent). The largest amount of electricity
is used for air conditioning and lighting (DoI,
2006, pp. 209). The government in particular
uses the bulk of its energy consumption for air
conditioning (DoI, 2006, pp. 198).
Each state has its own electricity system and
public authority responsible for the provision
of utilities. A board appointed by the
governor and confirmed by the state
legislatures (DoI, 2006, pp. 199) governs these
utility companies. All utility companies,
especially in Chuuk, face serious economic
problems as a result of high fuel costs.

2.3. RENEWABLE ENERGY
There are several existing and potential
sources of renewable energy in the FSM. The
potential use is particularly high for solar
energy and hydropower (Pohnpei State) but
also the potential of wind energy, bio-fuel,
methane-gas and tidal and wave energy will
be reviewed. For each source of renewable
energy the section will briefly describe both
existing and potential use.
2.3.1 SOLAR ENERGY
High solar insolation throughout the FSM
creates a rich resource of solar energy
although the available energy varies from
place to place because of local cloud
formation. This is especially the case on the
islands with mountains, such as the main
islands of Pohnpei and Kosrae and the Lagoon
Islands of Chuuk. Table 4 gives an overview of
the average estimated insolation on the four
states using data from NASA Surface
Meteorology and Solar Energy (2009).
Like other Pacific Island countries, solar
energy provides a particularly good source of
energy for outer islands that are further away
from the state centers and often have low
population sizes. Stand-alone systems can
provide a solution for the energy needs in
these places. There remain many
opportunities both to expand the use of off- grid installations on the outer islands and for
grid-connected systems on the main islands
where electricity networks are available (DoI,
2006). In the state of Pohnpei, 400 solar
home systems (SHS) were installed on several
islands in the early ’90s. This program formed
the largest outer island PV system program of
the North Pacific (DoI, 2006) for a long time.

and the spread of cholera.23 | P a g e
The project was set up by the University of
Guam that provided workshops on
installation, operation and maintenance.
More recently, under the European
Development Fund (EDF-9 REP5 programme),
a major PV electrification was implemented in
the outer islands of Pohnpei, Chuuk and Yap.
PV off-grid systems were installed in 11 outer
islands with a total capacity of 120.88 kWp
and in Kosrae five grid-connected PV systems
were installed, with a total capacity of 52.5
kWp. The PV systems in Kosrae are being
monitored by the utility and a more detailed
analysis of data from the grid-connected
systems is being an ongoing activity. The data
from Kosrae is being compared with similar PV
grid-connected systems in Nauru and Palau.
It is obvious that it is much harder to collect
performance data from the outer island
installations. FSM has therefore initiated a
plan to install VSAT satellite dishes to the REP- 5 installations that will enable them to do
remote monitoring of the systems. In
addition, the communities will be connected
to the Worldwide Web for communication,
education and emergency purposes.
Summarized performance information for
Palau, Nauru and Kosrae is given in Table 5
below.

Kosrae 52.5 5,600 1,280
Table 5: Performance of grid-connected PV systems in
Palau, Nauru and Kosrae
It is clear then that despite some limitations, solar energy has a large potential in the FSM.
There remain many outer islands where solar
energy can provide affordable energy to
people that would otherwise have to live
without. On islands in the state centers where
electricity systems are available, PV systems
can provide energy to the grid in order to
significantly reduce the need for fossil fuels
and create a more sustainable energy mix, as
well as reduce overall costs to both utilities
and families. State Island Site System

2.3.2 HYDRO ENERGY
The hydro sites on Kosrae have limited
potential and are unlikely to be cost effective
for development. However further study could
show that Kosrae might have a potential of
PICO Hydro installations that can act as stand- alone systems and power some houses
located close to the rivers. Yap and Chuuk
have no hydro sites. On Pohnpei there is a
hydro power installation on the Nanpil River.
There have been surveys that indicate other
developable sites in Pohnpei are present;
however at the time of the survey the
economics for the development of the sites24 | P a g e
were bad. Those surveys should be reviewed
in light of the fact of higher current fuel prices
and the sites for which it is economically
reasonable to be seriously considered for
potential hydro development. Due to the uplift of moist air by the
mountains, the rainfall on both Pohnpei and
Kosrae is high. The interior rainfall on both
islands is 200-300 inches per year, which
offers opportunities for hydro development
on numerous of its approximately 35 streams.
The stream flows however, vary a lot due the
rapid runoff and small catchments. Due to
this, the streams are generally not practical for
base load hydropower without using
expensive and environmentally problematic
storage ponds. Despite this, hydropower has
an acceptable tradeoff between reliability of
power delivery and cost of installation. In
some cases, drinking water reservoirs have
been used as storage ponds to secure more
constant water supply (DoI, 2006).
The Nanpil hydro facility was originally
developed by the Japanese in the 1930s. In
1988, the United States Army Corps of
Engineers came to develop a hydro plant next
to the old, non-operating one, using a
different water intake and a new building for
the installation, see Figures 10 and 11. The
total amount of power that can potentially be
produced is 2.06 MW. This is a substantial
amount of energy as it exceeds one-third of
the peak load on the whole island. However,
this amount of energy has never been
produced due to water intake limitations, which reduces the maximum output to 1.8
MW. The average is reduced even more due
to cyclical dry and wet periods on the island
and the lack of an appropriate water storage
facility to spread the production more evenly.
Figure 8: Hydro generators (Nanpil dam, Pohnpei)
In the beginning of the 1990s, there was an
idea for increasing the catchment area at
Nanpil at a cost of $6 million. This idea was
scrapped however, because the additional
output was uncertain due to the limited
hydrological data.
In 1981, a United States Army Corps of
Engineers study identified numerous potential
hydro sites, one on the Senipehn River and
three on the Lehnmasi River. Due to lack of
access roads, the relatively high cost per kW
for the site development and the distance
from the existing grid, they were not
developed. The total peak potential power of
the sites is approximately 4 to 5 MW, with an
average of 2 to 3 MW. Obviously, during the
two dry months less power would be
produced. The production site with the
highest potential was on the Lehnmasi River. The hydro sites that were labeled
economically unviable in the 1980s and 1990s
should again be reviewed due to the increased
energy costs, and if feasible, steps taken to
being developed. Despite the small
catchments and the variable stream flows so
that there is not enough water flow to secure
a continuous base load, the harm to the
environment of systems that make use of
existing streams (so-called run-of-the-river
development) is minimized and the systems
are relatively cheap.25 | P a g e
During its extensive operational life, it can
provide substantial fuel savings. The greatest
renewable energy opportunity for fuel saving
is offered by the small hydro development,
especially for the state Center of Pohnpei, and
possibly Kosrae, and therefore a thorough
review of the hydro potential seems
appropriate.
Figure 9: Hydro system in the Nanpil River, Pohnpei.
2.3.3 WIND ENERGY
The resource for wind energy is not very well
known in the FSM. Experts believe that it is
borderline regarding the economic feasibility
of energy production from wind.
Meteorological measurements and low
latitude location indicate moderate resource
availability. Furthermore, typhoons form a
risk for wind power systems. Figure 12 gives
an overview of the average wind speed
throughout the year in the four states. Due to the mountainous nature of some of the
islands, however, there may be locally
beneficial conditions for wind energy. The
main recommendation that also came out of
earlier studies on potential renewable energy
use is to carry out a feasibility study on the
use of wind energy throughout the FSM. After
broadly defining locations where wind energy
could potentially be implemented, detailed
wind assessments and wind maps should be
created to more precisely identify the main
wind energy sites. Appendex A shows the
wind speed data from Yap.
Figure 10: Average wind speed at 50m
2.3.4 BIOFUEL
A very interesting source of biofuel is coconut
oil. The outer islands have a large and
underutilized resource that could be further
developed. Using coconut trees is not new to
the country. There has been an active
industry for copra, the dry meat of coconuts,
after the Second World War until the 1970s.
Although the price of copra remained stable
after this period, the costs of living had
increased and so had the labor costs. This
reduced the incentive to commercially exploit
copra. As a result, there were few new
coconut plantings to replace an increasing
share of senile trees (DoI, 2006).

The country has the opportunity to develop
coconut production on outer islands and
thereby increase income for the outer islands.
At current prices and production levels,
coconut oil could be shipped to the state
centers where large diesel fuel users,
especially the utility companies and certain
businesses that might have back-up
generators, could add coconut oil to create a
fuel mix and reduce their use of diesel fuel.
This would boast the coconut oil industry and
prepare it for production on a larger scale
when diesel prices increase further. Revenues
to rural communities and reduction in costs to
the private sector in the centers would
certainly benefit the macroeconomic fabric of
the nation.
Until recently, there was an active coconut
factory on the main island of Pohnpei that
produced biofuel from coconuts. The
company could produce 150 gallons of
coconut oil, more than 550 liters, in an eight- hour day. Besides using this for their own
vehicles, they sold coconut oil to individual
and corporate customers on the island. With
little effort, an engine can be adjusted to run
on a mix of diesel and biofuel. The owners of
the coconut factory were making plans for
increased production and to start selling fuel
for boats. However, in July 2008, a fire
destroyed the whole factory. The owners had
no insurance and there were no readily
available funds to rebuild the factory. In 2001
a copra warehouse in Yap was devastated by a
fire (DoI, 2006), and in Chuuk a copra oil
production facility was also consumed by a
fire. Neither has been rebuilt.
This impacted the total amount of copra
produced and exported within the nation. Tables 7 and 8 below give some numbers on
the historical amount of copra production for
Pohnpei and Yap.

Biofuel from coconut oil remains a socially and
economically viable source of renewable
energy and efforts should be strongly pursued
to once again integrate it into the overall
energy mix.

2.3.5 BIOMASS
Biomass remains the largest source of energy
for cooking. For the mountainous islands of
the state centers of Pohnpei, Kosrae and
Chuuk, and some of the outer islands, biomass
in the form of wood is sufficiently available
without danger of deforestation. Also in lowlying atolls biomass is used for cooking but in
different forms, such as coconut shells, fronts
and husks, mangrove wood or plants (PIREP,
2004).
As in other Pacific Island countries,
commercial use of biomass for electricity
production by means of combustion or
gasification is limited to facilities that process
agricultural or forest products. There are no
industries in the FSM that processes such
products as agricultural processing tends to be
done in small scale, often family-owned,
decentralized facilities. There is currently no
industry that produces biomass waste. If
biofuel from coconut oil would become a
large-scale industry, enough biomass waste
could be generated to justify commercial
biomass combustion or gasification to
produce heat or electricity (DoI, 2006). In that
case, a feasibility study should be carried out
to give insight in the potential use.
Waste to Energy is another development that
is being carefully followed by the FSM
government and plans are being made to start
a (solid) waste composition study in 2010.
2.3.6 BIOGAS
There are some animal farms in the FSM that
produce enough waste to generate biogas in
an economically viable way. This way, animal
waste is disposed in an environmentally
friendly way with biogas as a byproduct.
Some small pilot biogas installations are being
installed in Pohnpei, with the assistance of the
Chinese government in 2008, and these are
being monitored by the Pohnpei State
government. There is also independent biogas
producer on the main island of Pohnpei that
tries to create a closed, environmentally
sustainable cycle in its household energy use.
Animal waste produced by a pig serves as
input for the biogas digestion tank, which
provides gas for daily cooking. There has been
some interest noted by the Kosrae State
Government to replicate such low-scale
household digester systems as well. Currently no facilities for sewer or landfill
treatment are used to generate biogas. When
these facilities are upgraded, a feasibility
study should be carried out to investigate the
economic and environmental sustainability of
an add-on facility to extract biogas.
2.3.7 OCEAN ENERGY
Although the country is surrounded by ocean,
there is at the moment no sufficiently mature
ocean energy technology that can be used in
the FSM. Available resources for tidal energy
are present in the FSM. The tidal range is not
very large, but through certain reef passages
and some man-made causeway and bridge
infrastructures, high speeds and high volumes
of water flows are observed locally. The FSM
energy sector is following the development in
ocean and tidal technologies and it is planned
to have pre-studies done between 2010 and
2012.28 | P a g e
2.4 ENERGY COSERVATION &
EFFICIENCY
A recently completed report has estimated
the potential of renewable energy and energy
efficiency to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions in a number of Pacific Island
countries (See: Table 10: GHG Emissions
and Potential Savings (Source: FSM SEFP
country report, IT Power 2006)). The total GHG
emission estimates are derived from
corresponding estimates of reductions of
fossil fuels in all sectors of the economy,
including power generation, transport,
household use, etc.
The table shows that in FSM by the year 2011,
it is, in principle, possible to reduce projected
fossil fuel use only by 14%, with about 70% of
the savings coming from renewable energy
and 30% from energy efficiency measures.
As shown in the table energy efficiency is an
important part of the energy sector, particularly in supply side management for the
utilities. The Pacific Power Association started
an energy efficiciency assistance programme
in 2009 for the utilities but presently no large- scale measures have been undertaken.
However, the average estimated electricity
consumption in electrified households is not
that high and decreasing over the last four
years, revealing that that demand-side
management (DSM) are starting to bear some
fruitage. High electricity cost and the
introduction of cash power meters (pre-paid
meters) have significantly developed some
energy saving behavior at the customer level
(Figure 11 below).
Figure 11: YSPSC customer education Source: YSPSC
newsletter July ‘08
It shows that EE and DSM could have a
significant impact in case of consideration at a
large scale, and that broad-scale programs
need to be implemented to create more
awareness amongst consumers.
Some of the utilities have actively started to
advise the public on DSM and discussions are
being held to start programmes such as
changing light bulbs and other energy
efficiency appliances. In addition, regulatory
frameworks and incentive programs at the
states can help spur private sector investment
and consumption in this area.

Figure 13: Policy Structure30 | P a g e
2. INSTITUTIONAL
In any national policy, providing a good and
clear institutional structure is a top priority.
This counts especially for an energy policy
where the sector is still under development
and defractured under the four States. In the
institutional and systemic structure, formal
linkages between actors and clear definitions
of their responsibilities are being addressed.
The main actors and institutions active in the
energy sector should be involved, including
the government at various levels, the utility
companies, the private sector and non-state
actors (NSAs), including NGOs and community
groups. Due to the current lack of
coordination in the energy sector, between
national and state, there is a need for an
organization in charge of overseeing and
coordinating activities in the country and in
the respective states. This organization
should interact with various stakeholders at
the national and state level and with the
government, the utilities, the private sector
and NGOs.
2.1 ACTORS AND INSTITUTIONS
A National Energy Workgroup (NEW) has been
established and consists of members from the
key Departments in the National
Government3, a State Representative coming
out of each State Energy Workgroup, a
Representative from the Association of
Micronesian Utilities (AMU), a Representative
from the College of Micronesia (COM-FSM)
and the Government Energy Advisor(s). NEW
has as its main task to oversee and coordinate
3Energy Division, Department of Resources &
Development; OEEM; SBOC (ODA); Department of
Transportation, Communication and Infrastructure
the activities in the energy sector especially in
relationship to the implementation of the
national energy policy. Since the NEW
consists of the main stakeholders involved in
the energy sector, this provides a forum to
discuss development in the energy sectors,
especially as it pertains to renewable energy,
and to help steer these stated priority
developments in the direction as indentified in
the energy policy/action plans. As can be seen in Figure 15 (page 39) the NEW
interacts closely with the national government
and with the Regional Energy Committee
(REC) and Association of Micronesian Utilities
(AMU). REC is the body under the Micronesian
Chief Executives Council (MCEC) consisting of
energy sector representatives from
Micronesia. Besides members from the FSM,
this body includes members from the Republic
of the Marshalls Islands, Palau, Guam and the
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
Islands. It meets regularly and is set up to
discuss developments in the energy sector of
respective countries, learn from each other’s
experiences and advices the Governments in
their energy planning. The NEW should be strongly connected to the
four State Energy Workgroups (SEW). These
consist of three or four people: one from the
state government, one representative from
the utility company, the state energy officer
(this position only exists in Pohnpei) or an
energy expert and a private sector or NGO
representative. The SEWs are responsible for
developing and updating the state action
plans, which are detailed in Volume II. These plans are in line with the national
energy policy and put forward specific
objectives and implementable actions at the
state level. Furthermore, the main task of the
SEWs is overseeing, coordinating and31 | P a g e
implementing activities in the energy sector of
the state.
2.2 COORDINATION AND
PROGRAM MANAGEMENT
This part of the energy policy is focused on the
responsibilities of the actors (NEW and SEWs)
related to the implementation of the policy on
national level and the coordination role in
implementing the various state action plans.
2.2.1 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ENERGY
POLICY
 Implement all State Action Plans and the
National Action Plan aimed at reducing
overall fossil fuel imports and
greenhouse gas emissions and strive to
meet national and state renewable
energy targets.  Develop timely a reliable nationwide
energy statistic database for effective
and fact-finding planning, monitoring and
evaluation.  Revise the National Energy Policy as
needed to ensure it is up-to-date and
maintains aggressive but achievable
outcomes.  Ensure every State has an Energy
Coordinator, who is part of the State
Energy Workgroup and keeps close
contact with the National Energy
Workgroup (see next section ‘Division of
Responsibilities and Organizational
Structure’).  Promote the development of a National
Energy Bill that addresses the reduction
of fossil fuel import and green house gas
emissions in line with this Energy Policy.
2.2.2 ALIGNMENT WITH LEGISLATION AND
OTHER POLICIES
 In line with the FSM Trade Policy and the
SDP, support opportunities for local
manufacturers to supply equipment and
human resources for project design,
implementation, management and
maintenance.  Integrate environmental concerns and
regulations into all energy-related plans
and projects, including transportation,
power supply, and building codes.  Promote proper alignment with policies
that are and will be developed in the
future, including policies in the field of
environment and climate change; Review
this Energy Policy in light of these
policies.  Assist in the development and
implementation of public awareness
campaigns supporting renewable energy
expansion geared toward key
stakeholders within the FSM, including
NGOs, business sector, governments and
utilities, state and national legislatures
and the general public.32 | P a g e

The overall goals apply to all the segments of the
policy (renewable energy, energy efficiency &
conservation and conventional energy). More
specific goals and objectives will follow in the
sections for renewable energy, energy efficiency
and conventional energy separately.
2.4.1 DISADVANTAGED AND/OR
GEOGRAPHICALLY REMOTE COMMUNITIES
 Encourage the application of
appropriate support and incentives to
enable disadvantaged and/or
geographically remote communities to
access affordable energy
2.4.2 CAPACITY BUILDING
 Improve adequate human and
institutional capacity to plan, manage,
and develop the energy sector by
providing appropriate energy-related
training opportunities at all
educational and professional levels.  Accelerate research and development
of energy technologies that are
appropriate for adoption within the
nation and facilitate international
transfers of appropriate technologies
that the nation is capable of operating
and maintaining.
 Assess and promote indigenous
resource potential and technical
capacity for all aspects of energy
sector planning and development.
2.4.3 PUBLIC AWARENESS
 Increase training and public
awareness on renewable energy and
fuels for vehicles, energy efficiency,
and conservation through publicity
campaigns and school curricula.
2.4.4 PRIVATE SECTOR INVOLVEMENT
 Enhance public-private partnerships
and expand private sector
participation, investment, ownership,
and management for energy supply
including electricity generation,
transmission and distribution.  Establish an enabling and competitive
environment for the introduction of
independent energy providers where
these may provide efficient, reliable,
and affordable service to consumers,
in light of existing state laws. 2.4.5 COMMUNITY LEVEL INITIATIVES
 Promote involvement and input from
non-government organizations and
local communities, including youth
and women, in policy implementation
and integrated planning.34 | P a g e
3. RENEWABLE ENERGY
The application of Renewable Energy is relatively
new inthe FSM. The definition that we have used in
this policy is:
Renewable energy is energy generated from
natural resources such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides,
geothermal heat, biomass, biofuel, waves and
waste that are locally available and sustainable
(naturally replenished).
In other words: Energy obtained from sources that
are essentially inexhaustible, unlike fossil fuels, of
which there is a finite supply.
3.1 GOAL
AN INCREASED SHARE OF
RENEWABLE ENERGY IN THE
NATIONS’ OVERALL
ENERGY SUPPLY
30 % OF THE ENERGY SUPPLY
SHOULD COME FOR
RENEWABLE ENERGY BY 2020
3.2 OBJECTIVES
 Promote the increased use of
renewable energy technologies in all
sectors of society and strive to meet
national and state-level renewable
energy targets.  Promote the effective management of
both grid-connected and stand-alone
renewable-based power systems.  Promote partnerships between the
private sector (including local
communities and NGOs) and public
sector, and mobilize external financing
to develop renewable energy
initiatives.  Promote equitable availability of
renewable energy in remote islands, rural areas on the main islands, and in
the state centers, with social- economic development in mind.  Encourage implementation and
markets for environmentally clean
technologies and alternative fuels for
transportation by using non-fossil
fuels and other power sources in both
new and existing vehicles.  Establish opportunities for better
access to renewable energy
technologies through the provision of
incentives and the removal of barriers
and constraints to sustainable energy
sector development.35 | P a g e
4. ENERGY EFFICIENCY &
CONSERVATION
Energy Efficiency and Energy Conservation are
closely related terms. However, during the NEW
meetings it was clear that people have different
understandings when we talk about efficiency and
conservation. The following definitions are used for
this policy:
ENERGY EFFICIENCY (EE) encompasses all changes
that result in a reduction in the energy used for a
given energy service (heating, lighting...) or level of
activity. This reduction in the energy consumption
is not necessarily associated to technical changes,
since it can also result from a better organization
and management or improved economic efficiency
in the sector (e.g. overall gains in productivity).
Energy Conservation (EC): is achieved through
efficient energy use, in which case energy use is
decreased while achieving a similar outcome, or by
reduced consumption of energy services
Simply said: reducing energy use is called energy
conservation and efficiency is the percentage of
energy that is actually used to perform work the
rest of energy that is '' lost '' to the surroundings
4.1 GOAL
IMPROVE ENERGY
CONSERVATION AND
EFFICIENCY IN ALL SECTORS OF
THE ECONOMY AND SOCIETY
ENHANCE THE SUPPLY SIDE
ENERGY EFFICIENCY BY 20% BY
2015 AND INCREASE THE
OVERALL ENERGY EFFICIENCY
BY 50% BY 2020
4.2 OBJECTIVES
 Improve the efficiency of energy
production, transmission, and
distribution through supply side
management.  Introduce demand side management
programs for enhancing energy
efficiency and conservation so as to
reduce the energy consumption in
government facilities, residential and
commercial buildings, industry,
agriculture and forestry.  Introduce and adopt building energy
codes.  Promote appropriate incentives
(including taxes, subsidies and tariffs)
to encourage efficient energy use and
minimization of waste.  Encourage co-operation in energy
efficiency and conservation programs
amongst the private sector,
consumers and governments, by
increasing public awareness and
improving access to information.36 | P a g e
5. CONVENTIONAL ENERGY
The importing of fossil fuels takes up more than
50% of the FSM aggregate sector grants. This
highlights the reliance of this type of energy source
in FSM and the urgent need for finding solutions for
being less dependent on fossil fuels. The term
“conventional energy” is widely used for fossil- based energy, nuclear energy, and large-scale
hydro and geothermal (whereas hydro and
geothermal also are renewable energy sources). In
this policy, the focus is only on fossil-based energy
like diesel, petrol, kerosene and natural gas.
5.1 GOAL
SAFE, RELIABLE, AND
AFFORDABLE SUPPLY OF
CONVENTIONAL ENERGY
REGIONAL BULK PURCHASE,
CENTRALIZED STORAGE AND
COORDINATION TO SECURE
AND OBTAIN EFFICIENCY BY
2015
5.2 OBJECTIVES
 Improve the competitiveness of
petroleum supply and support a
national approach to negotiations
with suppliers.  Promote the collection,
transportation, and environmentally
responsible re-use, disposal, or
removal of waste oil and other
petroleum by-products to minimize
adverse impacts on soil, ground water,
and near shore fisheries.  Encourage suppliers to maintain the
quality of petroleum products and
promote the use of appropriate
technologies to reduce the emissions
of green house gas and other
pollutants from conventional energy
at the supply and demand side.  Phase out government subsidies on
the purchase of fossil fuel for energy
production.  Work closely together with other
Pacific island countries to collect and
disseminate information on fuel
demand, regional fuel prices, and
related issues.  Work with the other North Pacific
Island States toward regional fuel
purchasing, thereby enhancing
economies of scale and reduced costs
to governments and consumers.37 | P a g e

2004 until February 2006, the fuel adjustment stayed stable but starting from March 2006 YSPSC adjusted the fuel
charge monthly. In March 2008, Yap State Legislature reversed the 2006 adjustments and the fuel charge was put
back to 3.5 ct/kWh. Acklowledging the financial problems the Yap State Government advised YSPSC to change the
tariff structure again and from December 27, 2008 untill March 2010 the tariffs are without fuel charge adjustments
but with the Government subsidizing the tariff by paying 73.7 ct per kWh while residents pay 31.8 ct per kWh.48 | P a g e
