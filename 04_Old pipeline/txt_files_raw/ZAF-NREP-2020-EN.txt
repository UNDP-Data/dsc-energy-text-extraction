VRE Variable renewable energy‚Ä¢	 The REmap initiative is IRENA‚Äôs assessment of the degree of transformation required for achieving
environmental and climate targets, and of related costs, benefits and opportunities. The study for South
Africa looks at the realistic potential for higher renewable energy uptake in all parts of the national energy
system, including the power sector, transportation, industry, buildings and agriculture. It also provides an
overview of measures for achieving higher shares of renewable energy, and of related costs and benefits.
‚Ä¢	 The study defines a trajectory to 2030 based on current government policies and plans (‚ÄúReference Case
2030‚Äù) and identifies the options for additional renewables deployment by energy-use sector and technology
(‚ÄúREmap Options‚Äù). The Reference Case plus the REmap Options equate to the ‚ÄúREmap Case 2030‚Äù. REmap is
not a scenario or a target-setting exercise but an options-based approach. The study is consistent with, and
builds off, key government policies. The options identified for additional renewables deployment beyond the
government policies can, individually or jointly, provide an input to decision-making actors in the energy sector.
‚Ä¢	 The study finds that final energy use from renewable sources in South Africa could increase from 196
petajoules (PJ) in 2015 (9% of total final energy consumption, or TFEC) to 568 PJ by 2030 (23% of TFEC). This
is a considerable increase compared to the Reference Case 2030 (366 PJ, 13% of TFEC). In the power sector,
the total share of renewables in electricity production could increase from ‚âà9% in 2015 to 49% by 2030
(compared to the Reference Case with 37% by 2030).
‚Ä¢	 The main power generation technologies identified to contribute by 2030 are onshore wind (21% of electrical
energy), utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) (14%), biomass/biogas (4%), distributed solar PV (2%),
concentrated solar power (CSP) (1%) and hydro (7%; mostly imported). In addition to the deployment of
renewables technologies for electricity, REmap technology options in end-use sectors are dominated by
solar thermal use in buildings and industry, and bioenergy in transport and industry.
‚Ä¢	 TFEC under the REmap Case is expected to increase from 2 290 PJ in 2015 to 2 493 PJ by 2030. South Africa
has an estimated total potential of 363 PJ by 2030 (compared to the Reference Case) in energy efficiency
savings across sectors.
‚Ä¢	 There are several challenges and barriers to increasing the shares of renewable energy, including the need to
understand implications for national power system operations, creating and employing new business models
for disruptive technologies, and the emergence of prosumers. Small-scale embedded generation presents a
unique challenge for municipalities, as it may challenge the operation of distribution grids and erode their
steady income.
‚Ä¢	 With the share of variable renewables (solar PV, wind) in the electricity mix reaching 37% under the REmap
Case 2030, the national grid system would need to be enhanced with technologies and investments to
strengthen flexibility, transmission and interconnection.
‚Ä¢	At the same time, the increased share of renewables in the South African energy mix offers key opportunities
such as diversifying away from a coal-dominated supply mix, reducing the environmental footprint of the
energy sector, and domestic manufacturing of renewable energy components.
‚Ä¢	 Suggestions for accelerated renewables uptake are to optimise the national energy sector structure (through
realignment), clarify and simplify the regulatory environment and ensure consistent implementation of polices,
undertake research in key areas for the energy transformation (including innovative technologies and
socio-economic aspects), realise the potential of embedded generation, increase sector coupling capacity in
transportation and industry, and widen the use of private public partnerships in the deployment of
renewable energy.
HIGHLIGHTSThe Republic of South Africa (RSA) is the third-largest economy in Africa and the highest primary energy 
consumer on the continent. In recent years, South Africa has faced several periods of load-shedding 
resulting from a lack of investment in the maintenance, rehabilitation and strengthening of power sector 
infrastructure. At the same time, the country has developed ambitious plans for gradually reducing 
national coal-based generation capacity and has successfully scaled up national renewables-based 
generation at a competitive cost, driven by the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer 
Programme (REIPPPP). Considering its extensive experience, its exceptional renewable resource base 
and its favourable policy framework for renewable energy, among other factors, South Africa can further 
expand its renewable energy use, including in transportation, industry, buildings and agriculture. The 
country also has opportunities to increase domestic manufacturing of renewable energy components 
and to be a frontrunner of the energy transformation in Africa.
In 2015, IRENA and the South African government agreed to prepare this Renewable Energy Roadmap 
(REmap) country study. The main objectives of the South African government for this study are threefold, 
namely: i) a transversal analysis of additional renewable energy deployment potential to 2030, beyond 
government policy and against international benchmarks (including the potential of renewables 
technologies in end-use sectors); ii) an identification of the costs and benefits of deploying these 
renewable energy technology options; and iii) an assessment of barriers and possible solutions to 
realising the options, in the context of the policy and regulatory framework of the energy sector.
The study builds off key government policies, foremost of which are the Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) 
and Integrated Energy Plan (IEP), and assesses technology options for additional renewables 
development to 2030. Technology options are assessed one-by-one ‚Äì this is deliberate because REmap 
is an exploratory study of additional renewable energy potential, not a scenario or target-setting exercise. 
The study further assesses the resource availability and costs for particular technology options, and the 
barriers and opportunities related to the renewables deployment in different energy-use sectors. 
Importantly, the REmap country study is not intended as a substitute for but as a complement to IEP and 
IRP, and serves as food for thought on further renewables potential not yet identified in government 
plans and targets. 
Methodology
The base year (2015) energy balance and Reference Case 2030 for this study were derived from the 
draft Integrated Energy Plan 2016 update (adjusted as necessary). Technology options for additional 
renewables deployment in different energy-use sectors are identified on the basis of resource potential, 
possible speed and scale of technology deployment and other constraints for development. The study 
includes text boxes on new policy documents and plans that have been released since writing this study. 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Current legislative, regulatory and policy framework
The national utility Eskom, the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA) and the Department 
of Energy (DoE) play the key institutional roles in the management of the national energy sector. Eskom 
dominates power generation, transmission and distribution, and 100% owns and manages the national 
grid, with a 20-year Strategic Grid Plan. There is increasing power sector liberalisation, which means 
increased competition within the generation space. In addition, many municipalities in South Africa own 
and operate distribution grid network infrastructure, while Eskom operates distribution grid infrastructure 
in other locations (Eskom distributes about 40% of all electricity to end consumers). Consent from Eskom 
or the respective municipality must be sought for any embedded generation projects.
The IRP (for the power sector) and IEP (for the overall energy sector) are the key policy instruments for 
planning the country‚Äôs energy needs and identifying technology options for energy supply and related 
costs. Both are intended as ‚Äúliving documents‚Äù and updates of both documents are currently pending 
approval. The White Paper on Renewable Energy of 2003 is, to date, the most comprehensive policy 
document pertaining to the government‚Äôs vision on renewable energy. The REIPPPP is the central 
renewable energy support scheme. With regard to energy efficiency, a post-2015 draft National Energy 
Efficiency Strategy (NEES) was recently gazetted, with a time horizon to 2030.
Most of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in South Africa emanate from energy supply and 
consumption. South Africa has committed to a policy in which the trajectory of total GHG emissions to 
2050 peaks (between 2020‚Äì2025), plateaus (until around 2036) and then declines (from 2036‚Äì2050).
Recent trends in the South African energy system
The 2015 energy balance provides an overview of the current national energy system and use patterns 
as a starting point for the analysis to 2030. South Africa‚Äôs total primary energy supply (TPES) is made up 
of coal (66.9%), oil (16%) and petroleum products (6.8%), with smaller shares for nuclear (3.5%) and 
natural gas (2.2%). Coal power plants account for 78% of national capacity, followed by hydropower 
(3.9%) and nuclear (3.7%). Renewables (excluding hydro) contributed a total of 4.7% to power generation 
capacity in 2015.
Total electricity production amounted to 272.2 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2015. Coal accounted for over 
85% of the mix, followed by nuclear (5.4%) and hydro (1.8%). Electricity demand has been mostly stagnant 
in recent years. This was mainly due to supply-demand shortages that resulted from poor operational 
performance at power stations (mainly caused by maintenance backlogs at major power plants and 
delays in the construction of new mega coal plants). Therefore, Eskom has at times been unable to 
generate enough electricity to meet needs. As a result, power cuts (load-shedding) were imposed to 
prevent a collapse of the national electricity grid (i.e. a blackout). Further reasons for the stagnant 
electricity demand in recent years are the improved energy efficiency driven by higher electricity tariffs, 
the relatively low overall economic growth and an increasingly large share of less energy-intensive service 
sectors in the economy.By the end of 2017, the REIPPPP had connected 52 projects to the grid with a further 10 under 
construction and 28 projects in the approval, planning or financing stage. The projects amount to a total 
of 3.9 GW of operational renewable grid-connected power capacity and an additional 2.4 GW in the 
pipeline with power purchase agreements (PPAs) approved. There are around 38 commercial biogas 
projects in operation in South Africa, with a total installed capacity of over 30 megawatts (MW). Under 
the small scale REIPPPP programme (i.e. projects that are equal to or less than 5 MW capacity), 20 small 
scale projects have achieved Preferred Bidder Status in South Africa, namely 16 solar PV, 2¬†wind and 
2¬† biomass projects. In addition, a Ministerial Determination was made for procurement of 800 MW in 
capacity from cogeneration projects.
There has been an increase in small-scale embedded generation (SSEG) (i.e. embedded generation 
capacity of no more than 1 MW and connected at low voltage) within the distribution grid networks of 
municipalities and Eskom. In some municipalities, due to a lack of division between rents from power 
sector services provided directly by municipalities and other taxes/levies, the rents from selling power 
are also used to cover other municipality services. In this context, the increased embedded generation 
may pose challenges for the operation of distribution grids and erode the steady income that 
municipalities have typically realised from stable electricity sales to customers in their jurisdictions.
The current national electrification rate in South Africa is around 86% (in terms of number of households 
being connected to energy supply infrastructure). Significant progress was made in on-grid electrification 
between 2005 and 2015. There are still many localised areas with relatively low levels of access. 
Renewable energy offers ample opportunities to enhance access, including from off-grid solar systems.
South Africa‚Äôs end-use of energy in 2015 was dominated by transportation (39.1% of total final energy 
consumption, or TFEC) and the industrial sector (38.5% of TFEC); buildings (residential, commercial, 
public) accounted for 19% of end use. The agricultural and forestry sectors accounted for around 3% of 
energy end-use. TFEC amounted to 2 290 PJ/year in 2015.
All energy-use sectors have seen increased use of renewable energy in recent years, particularly of 
residential and commercial PV installations, solar water heaters, and of industrial combined heat and 
power (CHP). Key drivers for renewable energy development in South Africa are the gradually lower cost 
of deployment for renewables, energy access objectives, the diversification of energy supply and 
environmental benefits. Increased renewables deployment can also lead to positive employment effects.
Significant progress has also been made since 2000 in reducing energy intensity (i.e. the units of energy 
used per unit of gross domestic product, or GDP), thereby exceeding the targets set for 2015 in the 
National Energy Efficiency Strategy of 2005 for most energy-use sectors. The energy efficiency 
improvements were the result of numerous causes, mainly deliberate policy and industry interventions, 
autonomous change and technology advancements. Reference Case 2030: Trajectory according to current 
government plans and policies
The Reference Case to 2030 provides a trajectory for the South African energy sector based on current 
government plans and policy. It is based on the Base Case scenario of the draft IEP 2016.
Under the Reference Case 2030, TPES is expected to increase from 4 555 PJ in 2015 to 4 950 PJ by 2030. 
The role of coal and traditional biomass supply is expected to be reduced significantly, whereas modern 
bioenergy is expected to grow from a negligible amount in 2015 to 20 PJ/year by 2030 (in the form of 
biogas). Solar and wind are expected to play a considerably larger role in primary energy supply in South 
Africa by 2030, increasing from 7 PJ and 18 PJ in 2015 to 216 PJ and 144 PJ by 2030, respectively.
TFEC in South Africa is projected to increase by 26%, from 2 290 PJ in 2015 to 2 856 PJ by 2030, under 
the Reference Case. Coal continues to play a significant role in the 2030 energy mix (either by direct use 
or coal-based electricity generation) while petrol and diesel continue to be the dominant primary energy 
supply options for the transport, mining and agricultural sectors. The share of renewables in TFEC is 
expected to move from ‚âà9% in 2015 to ‚âà13% by 2030. 
In the electricity sector, the share of renewable energy in electrical energy is expected to increase from 
‚âà9% in 2015 to ‚âà37% by 2030 under the Reference Case. Solar PV and wind are projected to account for 
a total share of 16% and 11%, respectively, by 2030, with hydro technology at 9% and biomass/biogas 
playing smaller roles. Coal is still expected to meet the majority of electricity demand (57%) by 2030. 
The share of renewables in TFEC in the commercial sector is projected to grow to 32% of TFEC (from 7% 
in 2015), as a result of electricity assuming the dominant role as energy carrier. In the industrial sector, 
the role of renewables increases from just above 5% in 2015 (42 PJ) to 18% (206 PJ) by 2030 under the 
Reference Case. In the transport sector, there is limited deployment of electricity (9 PJ by 2030), natural 
gas or hydrogen-based transportation in Reference Case 2030. In the agricultural sector, the share of 
modern renewables is expected to increase from ‚âà3% in 2015 to ‚âà13% by 2030.
Traditional biomass usage in the residential sector is expected to be replaced by electricity as 90% of 
households are expected to be electrified via on-grid connections by 2030. Overall, the electrification rate is 
expected to increase to 97% by 2030 (i.e. ‚Äúuniversal access‚Äù), including increases in off-grid connections in 
remote rural areas (likely enabled by a range of distributed energy technologies, including renewables). 
The Reference Case does not account for the targets of the draft post-2015 NEES because these are not 
currently reflected in the latest IRP and IEP versions. Rather, the post-2015 NEES targets are reflected in 
the REmap Case 2030. 
In the Reference Case 2030, carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) emissions are expected to increase by 17%, from 
‚âà390¬†megatonnes (Mt) in 2015 to ‚âà454 MT/year (yr) by 2030. Projected emissions under the Reference 
Case 2030 are within the bounds of the Peak-Plateau-Decline GHG emissions trajectory.Renewable energy potential and (future) costs in South Africa
The projection of renewable energy technology deployment requires a robust understanding of the scale 
and potential of available resources and the costs related to the deployment of different technologies.
South Africa has abundant solar irradiation and wind resources. The resources are distributed across 
virtually the entire territory. South Africa has identified different renewable energy development zones 
(REDZs) where generation projects may be developed with minimal risk of disturbing the environment. 
The potential for solar PV and wind-based power generation is effectively unlimited, to a degree that 
supplies can be integrated into the power system without risking grid stability. South Africa also has 
significant potential for further bioenergy deployment (from different resources) and some limited 
specific sites that are well-suited for small-size and medium-size hydropower generation. 
Besides the applicable technological and infrastructure limitations, the degree of exploitation of 
renewable resources largely depends on the costs related to different technology options. In recent 
years, primarily as a result of the REIPPPP bidding process, renewables options have become 
substantially cheaper for electricity generation compared to other new build options in South Africa, 
such as nuclear and coal. Solar PV and wind are the cheapest new-build generation options.
Specifically, successful bid tariffs achieved in the latest bid windows of the REIPPPP averaged 
USD¬†0.046/‚ÄäkWh for both wind and solar PV based electricity. The downward cost trends for solar PV 
and wind generation technologies are expected to continue for the coming years. Concentrated solar 
power (CSP) and bioenergy applications under the REIPPPP came in at USD 0.149/kWh and 
USD¬† 0.082-0.119/‚ÄäkWh, respectively. Baseload coal prices under the Coal Independent Power 
Producer (IPP) Programme averaged USD 0.074/kWh. The price estimate for nuclear power is 
USD¬† 0.081/kWh. Notably, additional system-related costs may result from integration of higher 
shares of variable renewables.
The costs for all key energy commodities are expected to significantly increase between 2015 and 2030 
(and further to 2050), pointing to a need to increasingly deploy alternative carriers (including renewables) 
to replace fossil fuels for heating and cooling, industry, and transportation.
REmap Case 2030: Options for increased uptake of renewables 
The REmap Case 2030 represents renewable energy technology options (‚ÄúREmap Options‚Äù) beyond the 
Reference Case 2030 that are considered feasible and realistic in terms of both resource potential and 
technology deployment speed. Under the REmap Case 2030, TPES is expected to decrease slightly from 
2015 (4 555 PJ) to 2030 (4 407 PJ) with a smaller (while still very significant) role for coal. 
TFEC under REmap Case 2030 is expected to increase from 2 290 PJ in 2015 to 2 493 PJ by 2030 
(including energy efficiency savings of 363 PJ). REmap Options increase renewable energy use in South 
Africa to 568 PJ by 2030 (23% of TFEC), a considerable rise compared to the Reference Case 2030.REmap Options in the power sector could allow for the total share of renewables in electricity production 
to increase from ‚âà9% in 2015 to 49% by 2030 (compared to the Reference Case with 37% by 2030). Power 
generation technologies identified to contribute to the renewable energy share as part of the REmap 
Options for 2030 are onshore wind (21% of electrical energy), utility-scale solar PV (14%), biomass/biogas 
(4%), distributed solar PV (on-grid/off-grid; 2%), CSP (1%) and hydro (7%; mostly imported).
With regard to small-scale renewables, 72‚ÄÜGW (136 TWh or 38 PJ) of solar PV potential is estimated to 
be theoretically available for deployment on rooftops. The total expected distributed generation from 
solar PV in the REmap Case 2030 is 5.8 TWh, including 1.7 TWh in commercial rooftop deployment, 
3.7 TWh in residential rooftop deployment and 0.4 TWh for new off-grid solar home systems (SHSs). 
In addition to the considerable deployment of renewable energy technologies in the form of solar PV and 
onshore wind in electricity, identified REmap technology options in end-use sectors are dominated by 
solar thermal (10% of end-use by 2030 in buildings) and modern bioenergy (6% of industrial end-use by 
2030) for heating, cooling and cooking. A total of 5 million solar water heaters (SWH) are expected to be 
installed in households by 2030 (translating to a total of 30 PJ). While traditional biomass (predominantly 
in the residential sector) is almost completely removed by 2030, modern forms of biomass are identified 
for various end-use sectors. The increased use of biomass for power generation and the blending of 
biofuels for transportation are also included in the REmap Options for 2030. In the transport sector, there 
is potential to significantly increase the use of electric mobility and hydrogen by 2030.
Although transportation is overall identified as a sector that could shift to alternative energy carriers, 
fossil-based liquid fuels in the form of petrol and diesel still dominate by 2030 (93% of transport end-use). 
REmap Options in the transport sector include the use of electricity (2% of transport sector end-use by 
2030), renewables-based hydrogen (1%), and biodiesel and bio-ethanol blending (4%).
In line with the post-2015 NEES, potential for improved energy efficiency is identified in the residential 
sector (20 PJ) with appliances and lighting as well as with regard to absolute reductions in commercial/
public building energy consumption (17 PJ). Industrial energy efficiency could be achieved through 
improving the efficiency of technologies supplying end-use services in manufacturing and mining 
(estimated potential of 186 PJ). Significant improvements in transport sector energy efficiency are also 
identified (140 PJ), namely from increased vehicle efficiency supplemented by increased transportation 
based on electricity, hydrogen and biofuels. Total energy efficiency savings add to 363 PJ by 2030.
Expected annual CO‚ÇÇ emissions under REmap Case 2030 are expected to decline by 25% from ‚âà388 Mt in 
2015 to ‚âà295 Mt/yr by 2030. The combined emissions from electricity and liquid fuels reduce significantly 
as part of the REmap Case 2030, from ‚âà310 Mt in 2015 to 195 Mt/yr by 2030. CO‚ÇÇ emissions from other 
sectors including transportation and final end-use grow from ‚âà80 Mt in 2015 to ‚âà100 Mt/yr by 2030.
Besides the reduced CO‚ÇÇ emissions from increased deployment of renewable energy compared to 
current policies and strategies, South Africa can also expect positive impacts of increased renewables 
deployment in terms of reduced air pollution, health benefits, employment gains and financial savings.Challenges and opportunities for scaling up renewables
There are several challenges and barriers to increasing the share of renewables across the energy sector. 
These include the need to understand implications for national power system operations, the creation 
and operation of new business models for disruptive technologies, and the emergence of prosumers.
In the power sector, South Africa will need to enhance energy access (through on-grid and off-grid 
infrastructure) whilst adding new generation options to substitute the expected reduction in coal capacity 
and avoid future shortfalls in electricity supply; this mainly relates to increasing investments in power 
infrastructure, including generation and distribution. South Africa also needs to further study and address 
potential impacts from higher shares of variable renewables on power system operation/stability. 
Further, there are regulatory and institutional barriers regarding realignment of the national power sector 
to the changing landscape. With regard to small-scale embedded generation, the evolving regulatory 
framework for municipalities needs to provide clarity on their role in the generation space. Key 
opportunities for additional deployment of renewable energy exist in sector coupling (i.e. using 
renewable energy-based electricity in transportation and heating), the use of renewables as an input to 
the production of liquid fuels and chemicals (i.e. power-to-X), and increased embedded generation. 
In the buildings sector, the lack of a standard for quality certification of solar PV modules and for gridtied small-scale solar PV, as well as the lack of a clear regulatory framework and asset financing products 
for embedded solar PV, are key barriers for expansion of embedded solar PV and other embedded 
technologies. Key opportunities that have been highlighted for further deployment of renewables in the 
residential sector include solar water heating, passive solar designs for space heating, stand-alone solar 
kits for dwellings and the use of biomass digesters for energy supply in rural residential areas.
In the transport sector, key challenges arise from mode switching to hybrid or fully electric transport. For 
increased deployment of electric vehicles (EVs), there is a need to address the lack of infrastructure and 
to provide additional financial support for market uptake. As a complementary benefit, by adding to 
system flexibility the use of EVs can reduce (or even eliminate) the need for storage of energy by the 
utility. Biofuels cannot yet compete on the market without policy or financial support mechanisms. The 
current lack of an effective incentive scheme adversely affects the exploitation of biofuels in 
transportation and other potential use sectors. 
The industry sector generally requires a constant energy supply, and supply interruptions are particularly 
harmful. The load profile of variable renewables is not well suited for this purpose. There is also 
considerable employment in the national fossil fuel sector that will need to be accounted for when 
embarking on a transition to renewable energy. Opportunities in the industry sector are principally in 
increasing energy efficiency, exploring new manufacturing opportunities for renewables technologies, 
and using renewables as a cheap input to liquid fuels (e.g. hydrogen). A switch to improved efficiency 
and renewables may be accelerated by introducing reporting requirements for major energy consumers.Recommendations to accelerate South Africa‚Äôs 
renewable energy uptake
Based on the analysis, the study provides recommendations along seven central themes, namely: 
‚óè Realign the national energy sector structure. 
‚óè Enhance investments in national power sector infrastructure.
‚óè Clarify and simplify the regulatory environment (particularly for small-scale 
embedded generation) and ensure consistent implementation of polices.
‚óè Support targeted research and development on innovative renewable energy 
(enabling) technologies, undertake research on a ‚Äújust transition‚Äù for the energy 
sector, and devise corresponding measures.
‚óè Increase sector coupling to exploit opportunities for renewables-based power 
to underpin other end-use demand sectors, such as transport and industry.
‚óè Widen the use of private-public partnership in the deployment 
of renewable energy.
‚óè Fully realise the potential of embedded generation.
COVID-19 recovery and beyond
Amid the coronavirus outbreak in early 2020, renewables and energy 
efficiency have become a key consideration in the country‚Äôs recovery plans. 
The newly updated Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), promotes renewables 
to boost electricity supply and enhance energy security. Renewable energy 
development can also help to align immediate needs with medium- and 
long-term energy and climate sustainability. 1 INTRODUCTION
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), 
through its Renewable Energy Roadmap (REmap) 
initiative, aims to pave the way to the promotion of 
accelerated renewable energy development through a 
series of activities that include the development of 
global, regional and country level studies. REmap 
analyses and activities also serve to inform other 
IRENA-related publications that focus on specific 
renewable energy technologies, or energy subsectors. 
At the outset, REmap emerged as IRENA‚Äôs proposal 
for a pathway to achieve the Sustainable Energy for 
All (SEforAll) initiative‚Äôs objective of doubling the 
global share of renewable energy by 2030, compared 
to 2010 levels; IRENA was designated as the 
Renewable Energy Hub for the SEforAll initiative. 
Today, the widespread deployment of renewables is 
becoming ever more crucial for meeting the objectives 
of the Paris Agreement, including the goal of limiting 
the Earth‚Äôs global temperature increase to well below 
2¬†degrees Celsius (¬∞C) above pre-industrial levels by 
2100. Two-thirds of global greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions stem from energy production and use, 
which puts the energy sector at the core of efforts to 
combat climate change. 
In 2017, IRENA, based on REmap methodology and in 
collaboration with the International Energy Agency 
(IEA), launched the study Perspectives for the energy
transition: Investment needs for a low carbon energy
system (IRENA and IEA, 2017) to provide a view on 
the degree of transformation required in the global 
energy sector to reach the ‚Äùwell below 2¬∞C‚Äù target of 
the Paris Agreement. The analysis was undertaken at 
the request of the German G20 Presidency and was 
reflected in the Agreed Documents of the G20 
Summit in 2017. An updated analysis was provided in 
2018 and published in the IRENA report Global energy
transformation: A roadmap to 2050 (IRENA, 2018a).
IRENA‚Äôs 2018 analysis suggests that existing and 
future renewable energy expansion, under current 
government plans and targets, will result in a 27% 
share of renewables in global total primary energy 
supply (TPES) by 2050 (IRENA, 2018a). Reaching the 
climate targets of the Paris Agreement with a 
probability of two-thirds would require increasing the 
share of renewable energy in TPES (excluding nonenergy uses) to around 66%; this reflects a 
considerable gap between the current global energy 
sector trajectory and the energy transformation 
required to meet the climate targets. The key general 
ingredients for bridging this gap can include increased 
use of wind and solar technologies, greater 
electrification of end-use sectors, the use of biomass 
(for heating, cooking and power generation) and 
biofuels, and more effectively combining energy 
efficiency and renewable energy measures (e.g. public 
sector policies that integrate renewables technologies 
for the renovation of public buildings). 
The REmap global database currently covers 70 
countries, representing over 90% of global energy use. 
Each country in the REmap analysis will play a role in 
the global transformation, even if by different means 
and with varying degrees of ambition, depending 
on the countries‚Äô resource base, technological 
possibilities and other factors. Besides the bottom-up 
global report, IRENA also provides country studies. 
So far, REmap reports have been developed for 13 
countries.1
In 2015, IRENA and the South¬† African¬† Government, 
through the Department of Energy of South Africa 
(DoE) and the South African National Energy 
Development Institute (SANEDI), agreed to prepare 
this REmap country study (referred to as the ‚Äústudy‚Äù 
throughout the document). The main objectives of the 
South African government for this study are threefold, 
1 All IRENA publications, including all REmap publications, are 
available at www.irena.org/.namely: i) a transversal analysis of additional 
renewable energy deployment potential to 2030, 
beyond government policy and against international 
benchmarks (including the potential of renewables 
technologies in end-use sectors); ii) an identification 
of the costs and benefits of deploying these 
renewable energy technology options; and iii) an 
assessment of barriers and possible solutions to 
realising the options, in the context of the policy and 
regulatory framework of the energy sector. 
In line with these objectives, the government and 
IRENA jointly established the main research 
questions. The government emphasised that the 
REmap country study should be consistent and 
aligned with key government policies, such as the 
Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) and Integrated 
Energy Plan (IEP), and should serve to provide food 
for thought on further renewables potential that is 
not identified in the current government plans and 
targets. Hence, the REmap country study is not 
meant to substitute or replace other government 
planning documents, especially the IRP and IEP. 
Rather, it complements the key government policies 
by alluding to additional technology potential and 
options that are currently overlooked. The time 
horizon of the REmap South Africa study is 2030, 
with some perspectives to 2050.
South Africa is the second-largest economy in subSaharan Africa (in terms of gross domestic product, 
or GDP) and the highest primary energy consumer in 
Africa. The total final energy consumption (TFEC2) in 
South Africa amounted to around 2.29¬†exajoules (EJ) 
in 2015 (DoE, 2016a). South Africa has significant 
potential from tapping into renewable energy options. 
2 Total final energy consumption (TFEC) is the energy delivered 
to consumers, whether as electricity, heat or fuels that can be 
used directly as a source of energy. This consumption is usually 
sub-divided into that used in: transport; industry; residential, 
commercial and public buildings; and agriculture; it excludes 
non-energy uses of fuels.
This study identifies the options for additional 
renewables deployment beyond the trajectory of 
current government policies and plans to 2030 (the 
‚ÄúReference Case 2030‚Äù) by energy-use sector and 
technology¬† ‚Äì¬† so-called ‚ÄúREmap Options‚Äù. The 
Reference Case plus the REmap Options amount to 
the ‚ÄúREmap Case 2030‚Äù, for which related costs and 
benefits are identified. REmap, notably, is not a 
scenario or a target-setting exercise but an optionsbased approach. The study identifies different REmap 
Options for increased renewables deployment that 
can, individually or jointly, provide helpful input to 
decision-making actors in the national energy sector, 
foremost the government of South Africa and its 
Department of Energy, which serves as the custodian 
of energy planning. 
This study starts with a brief description of the REmap 
methodology (Chapter 2). It continues by explaining 
the energy situation and recent trends of renewable 
energy use in South Africa based on the currently 
available data (Chapter 3). Chapter¬† 4 discusses the 
current energy sector framework in South Africa. 
Chapter 5 provides an overview of the Reference Case 
2030 for South Africa ‚Äì i.e. the trajectory based on 
current government policies and plans. Chapter 6 
discusses the resource potential and costs for different 
renewable energy technologies in South Africa. 
Chapter 7 identifies the REmap Options and presents 
the REmap Case 2030, including an assessment of the 
costs and benefits from the REmap Options. This is 
followed by a discussion of the wider challenges and 
opportunities for renewables use in different energyuse sectors in South Africa (Chapter 8) and 
suggestions for improving and accelerating national 
renewable energy uptake (Chapter 9). 2 METHODOLOGY AND DATA 
SOURCES
IRENA‚Äôs REmap offers an analytical approach for 
exploring how to accelerate renewable energy 
technology deployment beyond the pathway of 
current government policies and targets. This 
chapter outlines the REmap methodology and 
process, and the data sources used for the analysis 
in South Africa.
In general, REmap country analyses are the result of 
a collaborative process between the government, 
IRENA, national REmap experts in the countries and 
other key stakeholders. The analysis starts with 
national-level data covering both power generation 
and end-use energy demand (in buildings, industry, 
transportation and agriculture). The latest available 
official national energy balance forms the basis for 
the analysis (for example, 2015 as the base year for 
this analysis ‚Äì see Chapter 3). The Reference Case is 
based on current and planned government policies 
and targets (including commitments made in 
Nationally Determined Contributions [NDCs] under 
the Paris Agreement). Once the Reference Case has 
been established, technology options (‚ÄúREmap 
Options‚Äù) for additional renewables development are 
identified and their deployment potential is assessed. 
The choice of an options approach instead of 
scenarios is deliberate: REmap is an exploratory 
study of additional renewable energy potential, not a 
scenario or target-setting exercise. 
Renewable energy potential is assessed based on 
the resource potential and possible speed and scale 
of technology deployment and with consideration of 
other constraints for development, to identify a 
realistic degree of technology use. Hence, REmap 
Options are not purely based on cost optimisation. 
Rather, each technology option is characterised by 
its cost, and the benefits are assessed in terms of 
reduced carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) emissions and air 
pollution, as well as health benefits, employment 
gains and financial savings. 
Each REmap Option substitutes a non-renewable 
energy technology used to deliver the same amount 
of energy (e.g. power, cooking, heat, etc). The 
implementation of REmap Options results in a new 
energy mix with a higher share of renewables, which 
is called the REmap Case. Non-renewable 
technologies include fossil fuels and nuclear. 
Throughout this study the renewable energy share is 
estimated in terms of TFEC. Modern renewable 
energy excludes traditional uses of bioenergy. The 
share of modern renewable energy in TFEC is equal 
to total modern renewable energy consumption in 
end-use sectors (including consumption of 
renewable electricity and district heat and direct 
uses of renewables), divided by TFEC. The share of renewables in power generation is also 
calculated. The renewable energy use by end-use 
sector comprises the following:
‚óè Buildings: includes the residential, commercial 
and public sectors. Renewable energy is used in 
direct applications for heating, cooling or cooking 
purposes, or as renewable electricity.
‚óè Industry: includes the manufacturing and mining 
sectors, where renewable energy is consumed in 
direct use applications that comprise mainly 
process heat, and as electricity from renewable 
sources.
‚óè Transportation: entails the direct use of 
renewables through the consumption of liquid and 
gaseous biofuels, or through the use of electricity 
generated from renewable energy technologies.
‚óè Other sectors: includes agriculture, fisheries and 
forestry.
At the time of writing this study, the draft IRP 2016 
update and draft IEP 2016 of the government of the 
government of South Africa were the latest available 
official energy balances and projections. Hence, the 
base year (2015) energy balance for this study was 
adopted from the draft IEP 2016 (DoE, 2016a). 
The Reference Case 2030 for South Africa is compiled 
from the Base Case scenario of the draft IEP 2016. To 
account for relevant developments, the study includes

have been released since writing this study. 
Where necessary, official plans or projections for 
South Africa have been updated or cross-checked 
with information originating from other sources, 
including, amongst others, the following (note that all 
the below-listed sources are properly cited and 
referenced in Chapter 6 of this study):
‚óè Renewable energy potential by resource 
(theoretical and technology-specific): Renewable 
Energy Development Zones (REDZs), SolarGIS

concentrated solar power (CSP); Bloomberg New 
Energy Finance; IRENA renewable cost database.
In addition, expert opinions from DoE, SANEDI, 
IRENA and other key stakeholders in South Africa 
were incorporated into the analysis. Stakeholder 
comments and inputs were gathered at the occasion 
of two national review workshops that were 
convened by the DoE in September 2018 and 
November 2018 to present and discuss draft versions 
of the study, and through written comments 
(including a questionnaire distributed at the first 
national review workshop), data inputs and feedback 
by email. The vast amount of helpful stakeholder 
inputs formed a key information source for this study.3 CURRENT LANDSCAPE OF THE 
SOUTH AFRICAN ENERGY SYSTEM
This chapter presents the national energy sector data 
and current trends in the South African energy system 
as the baseline for the REmap analysis. It presents the 
current role and uses of renewables in the national 
energy mix, as well as the drivers for increased 
renewables deployment and socio-economic and 
environmental implications from current energy 
production and use.
The South African energy system must be analysed 
in the context of the country‚Äôs economic profile. 
Table 3.1 below provides an overview of the key 
economic, socio-economic and energy system 
indicators. The numbers help to describe the 
population and economy that the South African 
energy system serves and to explain some of the 
energy policy choices of the country.
KEY POINTS
‚óè For 2015, TPES is made up of coal (66.9%), oil (16%) 
and petroleum products (6.8%) with smaller shares 
for gas (2.2%) and nuclear (3.5%). Renewables 
begin to gradually account for a larger (while still 
relatively small) role (around 3% of TPES).
‚óè At the end of 2015, coal-based power accounted 
for 78% of the national power generation 
capacity. This was followed by hydropower and 
nuclear, making up 3.9% and 3.7%, respectively. 
Renewables (excluding hydro) contributed 4.7% 
to power generation capacity in 2015.
‚óè South Africa is heavily reliant on coal as a means 
of electricity production, accounting for over 
85% of the power sector energy mix. This is 
followed by nuclear and hydro energy sources 
with 5.4% and 1.8% contributions to the power 
sector generation mix, respectively, in 2015. 
Electricity demand has been mostly stagnant in 
recent years.
‚óè Renewables have made progress in recent years 
with the implementation of the REIPPPP. The 
Independent Power Producer (IPP) programme 
aims to procure new electricity generation 
through a transparent bidding process that 
drives costs lower over time through 
competition. To date, the REIPPPP has 
contributed to an additional 3.9¬† GW of 
operational renewable power capacity while a 
further 2.4¬†GW is in the pipeline. 
‚óè The REIPPPP has connected 52 projects to the 
grid with a further 10 under construction and 28 
in the approval, planning or financing stage. A 
further two projects are awaiting construction 
or are partially operational.
‚óè In April 2016 there were estimated to be 38 
commercial biogas projects in operation in 
South Africa. Existing commercial-scale biogas 
plants have a total installed capacity of over 
30 MW. Traditional biomass use amounts to 
around 127 PJ. 
‚óè All sectors have seen increased use of renewable 
energy in recent years, particularly of residential 
and commercial PV installations, solar water 
heaters (SWHs) and industrial combined heat 
and power (CHP). 
‚óè Key drivers for renewable energy development in 
South Africa are the gradually lower costs of 
deployment for renewables, energy access, 
diversification of energy supply and environmental 
benefits. Higher renewables deployment can also 
lead to employment benefits.
‚óè Significant progress has also been made since 
2000 in reducing energy intensity, exceeding the 
targets set in the National Energy Efficiency 
Strategy (NEES) of 2005 for most sectors. The 
improvements reflect a mix of autonomous 
change, technology advancements and 
deliberate interventions on energy efficiency.3.1 Base year energy status
The 2015 base year data for this study are taken from 
the draft IEP 2016 (DoE, 2016a3). At the time of 
writing this study, the latest official South African 
Energy Balance available from the South African DoE 
was for 2014. During 2018, the DoE released the 
official Energy Balance 2015 (DoE, 2018a). While for 
purposes of the national REmap analysis the official 
2015 Energy Balance could not be adopted as base 
year data, Box¬† 1 below summarises the official DoE 
Energy Balance 2015 and key differences compared 
to the 2015 base year data from the draft IEP 2016.
3 The full draft IEP 2016 report as well as Annexures and further 
related materials are available from the DoE website at 
wwwenergygovza/files/iepframehtml
Primary energy supply 
The 2015 primary energy supply is summarised in 
Figure¬† 3.1. The majority of South Africa‚Äôs energy 
requirements are met domestically. Imports are 
predominantly made up of oil and petroleum products 
(indicating minimal domestic supply for end-use 
sectors using these energy carriers, e.g. transportation) 
and some natural gas. The overall share of imports in 
TPES in 2015 was around 24.7% (IEA, 2016). For 2015, 
TPES is made up of coal (66.9%), oil (16%) and 
petroleum products (6.8%) with smaller shares for 
natural gas (2.2%) and nuclear (3.5%). Renewables have 
been deployed for power generation as part of the 
REIPPPP and begin to play a larger role albeit still small 
in relative terms (4% of TPES).

Some 96% of South Africa‚Äôs electricity is supplied by 
the national vertically integrated utility Eskom. In 
2015, coal-based capacity accounted for around 78% 
of the capacity mix in South Africa, followed by oil, 
large hydropower and nuclear, making up 6.6%, 3.9% 
and 3.6%, respectively. Renewables (excluding hydro) 
contributed 4.7% to power generation capacity. 
In terms of national electricity generation (including 
losses), coal accounted for over 85% of the generation 
mix. This was followed by nuclear and large hydro 
energy sources, with 5.4% and 1.8% contributions to 
the power generation energy mix, respectively. 
Renewables (excluding hydro) contributed a total 2.5%

South Africa‚Äôs installed capacity and electricity supply mix are dominated by
coal, while deployment of alternative technologies (including solar PV and wind)
is increasing.

Total: 51.6 GW
Capacity mix 2015
Total: 272.3 TWhto the electricity energy mix in 2015 (DoE, 2016a). 
Figure¬† 3.2 gives further details of the capacity and 
generation mix in South Africa in 2015.
Figure¬†3.3 shows the location of all power generation 
facilities in South Africa that are owned and operated 
by Eskom. The location of coal power plants 
highlights that the majority of South Africa‚Äôs 
electricity is generated in the north and northeastern parts of the country (i.e. the Limpopo and 
Mpumalanga provinces).
 .
The power generated must hence be transported 
over high-voltage transmission lines over hundreds 
of kilometres to the energy demand centres. 
Transmission over such long distances leads to 
considerable power losses in the national grid system 
in South Africa.4
4 IEA (2018) estimated electric power transmission and 
distribution losses (% of output) in South Africa for 2014 at 
8.39%.

Based on DoE (2016a).
End-use sectors 
As shown in Figure¬† 3.4, South Africa‚Äôs end-use of 
energy in 2015 was dominated by the transport sector 
(896 PJ, 39.1% share of TFEC) and the industrial sector 
(882 PJ, 38.5%); buildings (residential, commercial, 
public) accounted for 19% (443 PJ) of end use. 
The agricultural and forestry sectors accounted for 
around 3% (69 PJ) of energy end-use. Figure¬†3.4 also 
gives an overview of final energy consumption by 
energy source. Energy end-use in 2015 consisted of 
liquid fuels (45.2%), electricity (34.1%) and coal 
(11.6%) with small shares for biomass (5.6%) and 
natural gas (3.5%) (DoE, 2016a).
Industry 
The industrial sector contributed a share of 22.4% to 
South African GDP in 2015, of which mining and 
manufacturing (including construction) were 
responsible for 3% and 17%, respectively (Stats SA, 
2016a). Within the industrial sector, the energyintensive mining, iron and steel and precious and 
non-ferrous metals industries were large electricity 
consumers. 
Combined, they were responsible for around 60% of 
the industrial sector‚Äôs electricity demand. Around 
46% of energy was consumed to supply heat, of 
which coal supplied around 58%. Gas, liquid fuels, 
biomass/biogas (largely from the pulp, paper, 
food and beverage industries) produced around 
11% of electricity consumed by the sector 
(Stats SA, 2016a).Transportation
The transport sector in South Africa includes ports and 
shipping, roads, railways, airports and airlines. The 
sector accounted for 39.1% of national TFEC in 2015. 
Liquid fuels supplied 98% of energy in the transport 
sector in 2015 (DoE, 2016a). The share of petrol and 
diesel was roughly equal at around 50%. Freight took 
the largest share of diesel, making up around 60% of 
liquid fuel demand in the transport sector. Total freight 
transported was around 382¬†billion tonne-km in 2015 
(Havenga et al., 2016). 
Rail is an important contributor to long-distance freight 
transport, having carried around 140 billion tonne-km6
in 2015 (circa 35% of freight transport demand). 
Electricity accounts for a minor contribution to rail 
transport in South Africa. The transport sector seldom 
uses coal directly, instead using liquid fuel products 
(derived from coal). Over 30% of all liquid fuels in the 
transport sector that are produced locally are derived 
from coal using coal-to-liquid (CTL) technology (DoE, 
2016a). There is currently no biofuel (biodiesel or 
ethanol) blending with diesel or petrol at a commercial 
scale. 
In 2016, the National Traffic Information System 
recorded around 11¬† million vehicles in South¬† Africa, 
7¬†million of which were passenger vehicles, leading to 
a motorisation rate of around 125¬† vehicles per 
thousand people (eNaTIS, 2016). Although private 
vehicles provide the bulk of the vehicle population, 
public transportation has the greater share of 
passenger trips. 
The public transport share of passenger kilometres is 
around 53%. Privately owned minibus taxis are an 
important component of the public transport network, 
accounting for around 35% of total motorised trips 
compared to bus (9% of trips) and rail (6%) (van 
Ryneveld, 2014). 
6 A tonne-kilometre (tonne-km) represents the transport of one 
tonne of goods over a distance of one kilometre.
Buildings
Buildings (commercial and residential) were 
responsible for around 19% of TFEC in 2015. The 
commercial sector is the fastest-growing economic 
sector in South Africa, responsible for around 70% of 
GDP in 2015. Despite its dominant role in GDP, the 
commercial sectors‚Äô share of TFEC is small (less than 
5%). The commercial sector relies mainly on 
electricity, along with small amounts of coal and 
other fuels for thermal purposes. Electricity use in 
the commercial sector is dominated by the need for 
lighting and cooling. 
Building regulations/standards in South Africa, such 
as SANS¬† 10400,‚Ää7 have been amended to include 
energy efficiency provisions, which are likely to 
reduce the energy intensity of the commercial sector 
significantly in future. These regulations address 
building performance parameters encouraging energy 
efficiency and the use of renewables where possible. 
Generally, data availability for heating and cooling in 
buildings is not as comprehensive as for the power 
and transport sectors, and thus the energy-use mix is 
not as well quantified. Space heating and cooling 
energy services in South Africa have historically either 
been covered by cheap coal directly (in industry) or in 
the form of electricity. Renewables have made some 
progress over recent years as sources for heating and 
cooling in buildings, as electricity tariffs have increased 
by an average of over 10% over the 10-year period 
2008‚Äì2017, making other options more competitive. 
Space heating and cooling systems used in the 
commercial and the residential sectors are mainly 
heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) units. 
Heating and cooling needs vary across the country; 
the coastal areas tend to require a more moderate 
amount of heating and cooling, whilst heating and 
cooling needs are higher in the central regions.
7 SANS 10400 is the Code of Practice for the application of the 
National Building Regulations. Further information on SANS 
10400 can be found in Chapter 4 below and at 
www.sans10400.co.za/.Heating and cooling degree days (using 18 ¬∞C as the 
base temperature) vary up to a maximum of around 
3 300¬† degree-days annually. Cooling needs are 
highest in the north, whilst heating needs are highest 
in the mountainous regions, particularly around 
Lesotho.
Household use of electricity and other fuels varies 
widely by income group and between rural and urban 
areas. Traditional biomass use is still common in the 
rural areas, where the electrification rate and 
appliance ownership are lower. The continued use of 
biomass and other solid fuels in the residential sector 
is largely linked to poverty. Despite a rapid increase in 
the overall electrification rate since the early 1990s, 
and a policy under the DoE for 50 kWh in Free Basic 
Electricity (FBE) per month to each qualifying 
indigent household, many households can still only 
use electricity in limited quantities.
Energy use across all households in the residential 
sector is dominated by cooking and water heating. In 
low-income households this is primarily cooking, while 
in higher-income households it is primarily water 
heating. Water heating in low-income households is 
constrained by both an inability to afford the fuel and 
appliances needed as well as limited access to water. 
The percentage of households using electricity as 
their main fuel for cooking has increased significantly 
to almost 75%, compared to 51% in 2001 (Stats SA, 
2016b). Although many low-income households own 
electric stoves and use electricity as their primary fuel 
for cooking, solid fuels are still commonly used to 
supplement electricity. The DoE estimates that as 
many as 40% of households across South Africa are 
using multiple fuels for cooking (DoE, 2013a).
Box¬†1 provides an overview of the recently released 
Energy Balance 2015 and key differences against the 
2015 base year data from the draft IEP 2016 
presented in this chapter.
Box¬†1: 
DoE Official
Energy Balance 2015
In 2018, the DoE published the official national 
Energy Balance 2015 for South Africa. The 
official 2015 Energy Balance showed overall 
higher energy consumption compared with the 
2015 data presented in Chapter 3, Section 1 of 
this study (as derived from the draft IEP 2016). 
Particularly, the official Energy Balance showed 
higher biomass use in buildings and industry 
and higher coal and gas use in industry, while 
electricity use in industry was reduced 
compared to the draft IEP 2016 (note: the 
demand for electricity in the IEP is guided by 
the IRP). The demand for liquid fuels in the 
official Energy Balance 2015 did not 
significantly change compared to what was 
published in the draft IEP 2016 at the end of 
November 2016. 
The Energy Balance 2015 is available from the 
DoE website, www.energy.gov.za/files/media/
Energy_Balances.html.Energy efficiency 
The National Energy Efficiency Strategy (NEES) of 
2005 defined energy efficiency targets to be achieved 
by 2015 for each energy end-use sector. It thereby 
put energy efficiency on the agenda in South Africa 
and set the direction for areas of progress. A National 
Energy Efficiency Action Plan was developed in 2012 
describing the implementation of the strategy. In 
2014, the Energy Efficiency Target Monitoring System 
was established to monitor the progress on energy 
efficiency improvements and work towards meeting 
the original targets for energy reduction (based on a 
year 2000 baseline). 
Energy efficiency performance is measured in terms 
of ‚Äúenergy intensity‚Äù, which is a measure of the 
productive use of energy (i.e. the units of energy 
per unit of GDP8). The results of the monitoring 
analysis confirmed that significant progress had 
been made between 2000 and 2012 in improving 
energy intensity. 
8 High energy intensities indicate a high price or cost of 
converting energy into GDP. Low energy intensities indicate 
a lower price or cost of converting energy into GDP. 
A lowering of the energy intensity therefore indicates an 
improvement in efficiency of energy use.
These even exceeded expectations for most 
sectors. The improvements in energy intensity were 
found to reflect a combination of autonomous 
change, technological advancements, and deliberate 
interventions to improve energy efficiencies (DoE, 
2016b). Table 3.2 presents the 2015 targets by 
sector defined in the NEES 2005 and compares 
them to the progress achieved by 2012. 
To build on these achievements and stimulate further 
improvements in energy efficiency through the 
combination of fiscal and financial incentives, a 
robust legal and regulatory framework, and enabling 
measures, the government published the draft post2015 NEES for public consultation in late December 
2016 (DoE, 2016b). The framework of the Post-2015 
NEES (Chapter 4) and the new targets to 2030 
(Chapter 7) are discussed below. 
Table 3.2: Improvements in energy intensity (2000‚Äì2012) compared to NEES 2005 targets

Based on DoE (2015a)3.2 Trends in renewable energy 
use in South Africa
The Renewable Energy Independent 
Power Producer Procurement Programme 
(REIPPPP)
The Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer 
Procurement Programme (REIPPPP) was developed 
to stimulate the development of a renewable energy 
industry in South Africa by encouraging private sector 
investment. The REIPPPP is a transparent bidding 
process that drives costs lower over time through 
competition. More than five competitive bidding 
rounds were held between 2011 and 2018, including 
extra and expedited rounds as well as a bidding round 
dedicated specifically to 200 MW of CSP capacity in 
2014. Each potential IPP bids for an opportunity to 
reach financial close where several key contracts are 
finalised, including: the power purchase agreement 
(PPA), the implementation agreement and the grid 
connection agreement. Bids are generally made for 
selling electricity using specific technologies, and only 
bids under the same technology category are allowed 
to compete against each other. Eligible technologies 
under the REIPPPP include onshore wind, solar PV, 
CSP, small-scale hydro, biomass, and biogas or landfill 
gas (DoE, DNT and DBSA, 2018a).
The REIPPPP was designed to assist with multiple 
national objectives such as meeting national 
renewables targets, encouraging foreign investment, 
fostering socio-economic development and 
protecting the environment. Bids are assessed in 
terms of their tariff (70% weighting) and their 
economic development impact (30% weighting) 
(DoE, DNT and DBSA, 2018b). 
Economic development requirements are non-price 
factors, which promote job growth, community 
development, black economic empowerment (i.e.
employment, management, and ownership by 
previously disadvantaged groups), and domestic 
industrialisation. For example, there is a black 
ownership requirement of 12% to 30% of project 
shareholding and a local community ownership 
requirement of 2.5% to 5% of project shareholding 
(DoE, DNT and DBSA, 2018b).
Renewable energy investment accelerated as a result 
of the introduction of the REIPPPP. As shown in 
Figure¬† 3.5, at the end of 2017, there was 3.9¬† GW of 
renewable energy capacity operational in South Africa, 
and an additional 2.4¬†GW with PPAs approved in 2018. 
At the end of 2017, total solar PV and wind capacity 
had grown to 1.5¬†GW (38% of installed capacity under 
the REIPPPP) and 2.1¬†GW (54%), respectively, up from 
1.0¬† GW/1.1¬† GW in 2015 (note that this increase in 
renewable energy capacity between 2015‚Äì2017 is not 
reflected in Chapter 3, Section 1, which presents 2015 
data). 
Sources in the literature may differ slightly with regard 
to the level of solar PV and wind deployment in 2015, 
depending on whether projects under development 
and/or construction were included in the statistics 
rather than only projects that were fully operational. So 
far, 41 MW of biomass and 18 MW of landfill gas has 
been procured under the REIPPPP. On a pure LCOE 
basis, renewables procured in the REIPPPP compete 
favourably relative to other technologies, including 
new-build baseload coal. See Chapter 6 for more 
information on renewable resource potential and 
related costs. Figure¬†3.5: Deployment of renewables in South Africa as part of the REIPPPP, 2013‚Äì2017

Based on Data from Eskom; DoE, DNT and DBSA (2018a)
As of 2017, there was 3.9 GW of renewable energy capacity operational,
including 1.5 GW of solar PV and 2.1 GW of wind. In addition, 2.4 GW is with
PPAs approved in 2018. Power generation from renewable sources has grown
steadily in past years. In 2017, generation from solar PV was around 3.3 TWh;
wind, 5 TWh; and CSP, 0.7 TWh. This is expected to increase to a total of
21 TWh with additional approved capacities.
Key insight:Figure¬† 3.6 indicates all projects approved during the 
REIPPPP (Bid Windows 1‚Äì4) as of 2015 and delineates 
them by technology and location. More than half of all 
projects approved under the REIPPPP were located in 
the Northern Cape, Eastern Cape and Western Cape. 
The considerable solar and wind resources in these 
areas, combined with low population densities (in the 
Northern Cape) and few competing land uses, make 
for suitable project sites for utility-scale renewables. 
Major electricity demand centres are located in the far 
southwestern part of the country (i.e. Cape Town), 
as well as the industrial hubs of Gauteng and Durban. 
As can be seen in Figure¬† 3.6, most IPPs¬† have built 
their facilities in close proximity to major substations 
or transmission lines. This minimises the need to 
construct additional power network infrastructure 
(which can become a significant component of total 
costs for the IPP). The renewable energy resource 
distribution in South Africa is further shown in 
Chapter¬†6.

The DoE also introduced a small-scale REIPPPP in 
2013 for projects equal to or less than 5 MW of 
capacity. The small-scale REIPPPP follows the same 
basic structure as the large-scale REIPPPP. A total 
capacity of 200 MW is planned to be procured under 
the small-scale REIPPPP.
Small-scale REIPPPP projects have been slower to 
develop in South Africa when compared to the 
utilityscale REIPPPP projects. 
They are seen as an entry point for entrepreneurs 
looking to expand their footprint into renewables. A 
total of¬†20 small-scale projects, jointly amounting to 
a capacity of 99 MW,‚Ää9 have achieved Preferred 
Bidder Status in South Africa as part of the DoE‚Äôs 
Small-Scale REIPPPP; namely 16 solar¬† PV, 2 wind 
and 2 biomass projects. Most of the projects are 
located in the Northern Cape (11), followed by Free 
State (4) and Western Cape (3). An overview of the 
preferred bidders is shown in Table 3.3, while Table 
3.4 provides of the geographical distribution of the 
small-scale projects.

away from large-scale coal
A few notable other renewables projects exist 
outside of the REIPPPP. These include two wind 
farms and one CSP plant. The Sere wind farm 
(100 MW) is located in the Western Cape and was 
commissioned in 2015 by Eskom (Eskom, 2016). The 
Darling Wind Energy project has an installed 
capacity of 5.2 MW and was commissioned in 2008 
in the Western Cape with the City of Cape Town 
municipality as the off-taker. Eskom previously 
embarked on an effort to develop a 100 MW CSP 
plant near Upington in the Northern Cape. This 
uncompleted project was discontinued in 2018, and 
the financial resources earmarked for this project 
were diverted into research and development for 
battery technology. 
Small-scale embedded generation (SSEG)
‚ÄúEmbedded generation‚Äù entails production of 
electricity on the customer side of the meter and 
therefore at the same location as where the 
electricity is consumed. Since part of the demand is 
satisfied by own-production, net demand is generally 
lower for a consumer that uses an embedded 
generator. In South Africa, distribution networks are 
owned and operated either by a municipality or by 
the national utility Eskom, depending on the locality 
they serve. Distribution grids within large urban 
areas are commonly owned and operated by metro 
municipalities while smaller or poorer municipalities 
are served by Eskom-owned distribution grids since 
these municipalities may not have the capacity to 
operate the grid infrastructure (NERSA, 2018). 
In recent years, municipalities and Eskom have noted 
an increase in SSEG (i.e. embedded generation 
capacity of no more than 1 MW and connected at a 
low voltage) within their distribution grid networks. In 
some municipalities, due to a lack of division between 
rents from power sector services provided directly by 
municipalities and other taxes/levies, the rents from 
selling power are also used to cover other municipality 
services. The tariffs for generating such revenues are 
set under a regulated process that is described in 
Chapter 4. The decreased income poses a grave 
challenge for municipalities because electricity sales 
are often their most reliable income stream. 
In this context, the increase in embedded generation 
may pose challenges for the operation of distribution 
grids and erode the steady income that South African 
municipalities have typically realised from stable 
electricity sales to customers in their jurisdictions. For 
this reason, efforts to monitor such embedded 
generation deployments have increased and 
regulations have been drafted on requirements to 
register such installations. However, embedded 
generation also offers large opportunities and could be 
a cheaper solution for renewable power deployment. 
Table 3.5 shows the results of the monitoring efforts 
so far; these numbers are generally accepted to be 
lower than the actual ones. Given the vast resources 
needed to investigate and search for illegal embedded 
generators, the numbers in Table 3.5 are based on 
voluntary registration or disclosure by the owners of 
these small-scale systems. The table shows that the 
number of municipalities that proactively monitor and 
offer dedicated feed-in tariffs (only available to those 
with registered and approved grid connections for 
their systems) for SSEG installations in South Africa is 
increasing rapidly. Table 3.5: Municipalities managing SSEG in South Africa (2016)

Source: SALGA (2017)The shortages in electricity supply experienced in 
South Africa in 2008 and again in 2014 highlighted 
the urgent need to expand generation capacity to 
reduce potential economic losses related to electricity 
shortages. Installed solar¬†PV capacity in the residential 
and commercial sectors has been growing steadily, 
from a negligible base in 2010 to an estimate of 
around 285 MW by 2017 with 90% of the installation 
occurring in the last four years (PQRS, 2016). This 
rapid increase in SSEG installations is associated with 
a sharp decline in technology costs combined with 
increasing grid electricity costs.
While embedded generation is still in its infancy, the 
electricity shortages that occurred have also prompted 
industrial electricity consumers to assess the feasibility 
of further developing cogeneration and/or rooftop or 
ground-mounted solar PV facilities. This would provide 
some protection to industrial consumers against 
electricity supply interruptions in the future.
Private sector cogeneration
Numerous private sector industrial companies in South 
Africa are venturing into options for becoming energy 
independent through embedded generation, and 
renewables are among the most attractive options 
available to them. For example, the global paper 
manufacturer Sappi is taking advantage of 
cogeneration opportunities. 
Sappi has developed two biomass generation facilities in 
Ngodwana (in Mpumalanga) and Saiccor (southern 
KwaZulu-Natal) to assist in moments of power supply 
constraints. On a national level, Sappi (which runs seven 
mills) generates more electricity than it uses, and it 
could become a net exporter of power to the national 
grid (Sappi Group, 2018). In April 2018, Sappi reached 
financial close on its 25 MW bioenergy project at 
Ngodwana10 with a potential additional 200 MW of 
power generation projects in the pipeline identified as 
early as 2013 (TAPPSA Journal, 2013). Several other 
industrial subsectors feature prominently in terms of 
private sector cogeneration. In 2015, CHP capacity in 
pulp, paper and sugar mills combined was approximately 
350 MW.
The IPP Procurement Programme in South Africa also 
extends to cogeneration schemes. The Cogeneration 
IPP programme procures energy through three 
technologies, namely waste-to-energy, CHP, and 
industrial biomass. The programme has two criteria 
that need to be fulfilled for eligibility: i)¬†the fuel and/or 
energy source originates from an underlying industrial 
process; and ii)¬†the cogeneration facility is coupled to 
the industrial process of a host plant. In December 
2012, a Ministerial Determination was made for 
procurement of 800 MW in capacity from cogeneration 
projects11 (DoE, 2016c). Under this procurement 
programme, the price caps as listed in Table 3.6 apply.
10 The 25 MW Ngodwana Energy Biomass Project was South 
Africa‚Äôs first biomass project under the REIPPPP to reach 
financial close. It will be fuelled using waste wood chips from 
Sappi‚Äôs plantations and its Ngodwana Mill (ESI Journal, 2018).
11 An amendment is in process that could increase the 
Determination to 1 800 MW. However, as of March 2019, the 
process had not reached conclusion (see IPP Cogeneration 
website at www.ipp-cogen.co.za/).

capacity. The project developer is Tugela Energy 
Project Company using CHP technology. The project 
bid a price of USD¬†0.071/kWh under the Cogeneration 
IPP Program (DoE, 2016c).
Bioenergy and biogas
The uptake of biogas for both commercial and rural 
applications has generally been slow. In April 2016 there 
were estimated to be 38 commercial biogas projects in 
operation in South Africa. Existing commercial-scale 
biogas installations have a combined installed capacity 
of over 30 MW.13
12 Note: The default ZAR-USD exchange rate applied in this study 
is ZAR¬†14 = USD¬†1. However, different ZAR-USD exchange 
rates are applied in some instances to adopt the rate per the 
respective dates or time periods of statistics/projections 
(especially when the cost data was taken from existing reports 
or databases that applied a specific historical exchange rate).
13 Since installations of digesters are not well trackedthis 
The Working for Energy Programme aims to provide 
sustainable clean energy solutions to rural and lowincome urban communities. It is currently involved in 
three community rural biogas initiatives, namely the 
iLembe District initiative in KwaZulu-Natal, the Melani 
Village Biogas Expansion Project in the Eastern Cape 
and the Mpufuneko Biogas Project in Limpopo (Gibson, 
2016) with the aim to provide sustainable clean energy 
solutions to rural communities. The programme is 
managed and rolled out by SANEDI. Figure¬†3.7 gives an 
overview of the locations of the bioenergy projects.

0 50 100 200 300 400 kmThe potential for bioenergy in South Africa is limited 
by the relatively low primary productivity, largely 
constrained by rainfall and exacerbated by significant 
inter-annual variability. These factors, together with 
competing land uses, combine to limit the 
attractiveness of energy derived from biomass. The 
Bioenergy Atlas for South Africa (Hugo, 2016) 
provides a basic techno-economic assessment of 
options for biomass conversion to energy, and an 
evaluation of factors such as job creation, impact on 
rural economies, GHG emissions mitigation and likely 
subsidies required to make energy products 
cost-competitive. 
The national biomass energy potential identified in the 
Bioenergy Atlas is presented in Chapter 6 of this 
study. Over the first four bid windows of the REIPPPP, 
41 MW of biomass generation capacity and 18 MW of 
landfill gas-based generation capacity were procured.
The role of storage and flexibility in 
renewables deployment
Energy storage systems complement electrical grids 
by capturing excess electricity during periods of low 
demand. Storage systems can therefore be an 
important complement to variable renewable energy 
(VRE) supplies, helping to load-balance. The stored 
energy is later converted back to electrical power and 
returned to the grid. Energy storage also includes 
conversion from electrical energy to mediums such as 
ice and hot water, which is used for heating and 
cooling at times when electricity is at a higher 
demand and thus more expensive. This method can 
be used by consumers as a way of load shifting. South 
Africa has made some progress in integrating storage 
systems into the power system, with utilityscale 
pumped hydro storage being the most common type 
(as is the case globally). Table 3.7 shows existing 
large-scale energy storage projects in South Africa, 
ordered by technology/type.

Based on EE Publishers (2017)The Ingula Pumped Storage Scheme (see 
Table¬†3.7) expands flexibility and storage capacity. 
Other planned flexible generation capacity 
includes gas-fired generation in Richards Bay and 
Coega. Newly commissioned open cycle gas 
turbines (OCGTs) operating on diesel at Avon in 
KwaZuluNatal and Dedisa in the Eastern Cape also 
provide flexible peaking capacity for the South 
African power system. 
Beyond these planned capacities, South Africa could 
also look into options for increasing the flexibility of 
its coal plants. Traditionally, most coal-based 
generation plants have been designed to meet 
baseload and cannot be ‚Äúflexibly‚Äù ramped up or down 
at short notice. However, flexibilisation can be 
achieved through process improvement, increasing 
automation or retrofitting certain plant components. 
For example, at the Weisweiler hard coal power 
plant in Germany, control system upgrades were 
carried out and software for power generation 
process control system and plant operations 
optimisation was implemented to improve flexibility; 
these upgrades reduced minimum load by 170 MW 
and increased ramp rate by 10 MW/minute at Unit G 
and by 110 MW at Unit H (Agora Energiewende, 
2017). Other experiences in flexibilisation of coal 
plants exist inter alia from China, Denmark and India.14
14 For further information and case studies on flexible generation 
from conventional plants, see the IRENA brief on increasing 
flexibility of conventional power plants (forthcoming; the brief 
will be available from the IRENA website, www.irena.org).
Considering South Africa‚Äôs large coal generation 
capacity and expertise in the area, the country could 
look into options to enhance the flexibility of its coal 
plants to help accommodate the variability resulting 
from large-scale solar PV and wind generation, 
adding an additional layer of system flexibility.
3.3 Bulk power supply 
infrastructure
The installed generation capacity of the South African 
power system is summarised in¬† Figure¬† 3.2 (see 
above). New coal-fired generation plants (especially 
the Medupi and Kusile plants with a combined 
planned capacity of 9.6¬† GW) are scheduled to 
increase coal-based generation capacity. These 
developments combined with rapid expansion of the 
renewables sector through the REIPPPP will require 
large-scale investment into transmission expansion as 
well as more substations to facilitate the new 
connections. 
However, the investments made in the maintenance, 
rehabilitation and strengthening of national power 
sector infrastructure have been insufficient. This has 
led to a severe backlog and generation deficits and 
blackouts. This is further explained in Box¬† 2 and 
Chapter 9, Section 2.Figure¬†3.8 indicates the current transmission network 
infrastructure and maps out planned development of 
this infrastructure to 2025. South Africa‚Äôs existing and 
planned transmission network infrastructure should 
be able to accommodate further new generation 
capacity and is periodically updated. While Figure¬†3.8 
gives a guideline of where future network 
construction may take place, Eskom has also 
identified strategic corridors (each 100km wide) as 
shown in Figure¬† 3.9 within which many of these 
infrastructure developments may occur. The strategic 
corridors are key focus areas for the grid expansion 
plans and will allow Eskom to better plan and 
expedite construction of the necessary transmission 
infrastructure. Eskom has started the approval 
process with the Department of Environmental 
Affairs (DEA) to identify any major environmental 
concerns related to the strategic corridors.
The strategic corridors are generally located to allow 
for the connection of more renewable energy projects 
to the grid. In 2012, the DEA appointed the Council of 
Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) to undertake 
a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) with the 
aim of identifying geographical areas best suited for 
the rollout of wind and solar PV energy projects, 
referred to as Renewable Energy Development Zones 
(REDZs), in which development will be incentivised 
and streamlined. The assessment identified eight 
REDZs in South Africa that are of strategic importance 
for large-scale wind and solar PV development in the 
country (see Table 3.8). The eight REDZs in South 
Africa have a combined size of over 80 000 km¬≤ and 
are spread across five provinces.
15 President Ramaphosa made these remarks in his State of the 
Nation Address on 7 February 2019. The news emerged after 
the writing of this study and therefore was not reflected in the 
present findings.
Box¬†2: Lack of investment in the national power sector
The national power sector in South Africa has been constrained by a lack of investments in the 
maintenance of existing power plants and construction of new power plants. Many existing plants are 
under-performing, while the new mega coal plants ‚Äì Medupi and Kusile (around 4.8 GW planned 
capacity each) ‚Äì are years behind schedule, significantly over budget and not properly functioning due 
to technical problems. Therefore, Eskom has at times been unable to generate enough electricity to 
meet needs. In the event of these supply shortages, power cuts (load-shedding) are imposed to prevent 
a collapse of the national electricity grid (i.e. a blackout). For example, on 11 February 2019, 4 000 MW 
of power was cut from the national grid to prevent it from collapsing (The Economist, 2019). Before the 
rolling outages starting in late 2018, South Africa had already experienced power cuts/load-shedding in 
2007‚Äì2008 and 2015. 
Besides the maintenance of existing power plants and the construction of new plants, the inadequacy of 
infrastructure investments also concerns the maintenance of ageing grid infrastructure. Many 
municipalities currently face a severe backlog in terms of distribution grid maintenance (see Chapter 8, 
Section 1) (EE Publishers, 2016a). The shortage and unreliability of electricity supply and distribution 
impact the entire economy and suppress economic growth in South Africa (The New York Times, 2019). 
Significant investments in power infrastructure are therefore needed. At the same time, despite the 
significant increase of national electricity tariffs in recent years, Eskom faces significant financial 
challenges and mounting debt, which hamper its ability to upgrade power infrastructure. To address 
some of Eskom‚Äôs structural challenges, President Cyril Ramaphosa in February 2019 announced the 
unbundling of the utility into three separate parts, declaring that the country would ‚Äúimmediately 
embark on a process of establishing three separate entities ‚Äì Generation, Transmission and Distribution 
‚Äì under Eskom Holdings‚Äù (Government of South Africa, 2019).¬π‚ÅµThe location of the REDZs, alongside the transmission 
corridors, is provided in Figure¬† 3.9. The northern 
corridor primarily caters for solar PV and CSP projects 
in the Northern Cape Province while the eastern 
corridor is positioned to cater for onshore wind 
projects that are commonly implemented in the 
Eastern Cape Province. 
In a similar manner, the central corridor is co-located 
with many wind and solar PV projects developed in 
the Western Cape Province and the Northern Cape. 
REDZs are a key element supporting energy-related 
strategic infrastructure projects (SIPs) identified by 
the South African government. Chapter 6, Section 1 
of this study provides further details about the REDZs.

Strategic transmission corridors provide focal areas that allow Eskom to better
plan and expedite necessary transmission infrastructure to interconnect new
generation capacity; particularly, projects located within the governmentapproved REDZs.
Key insight:In addition to expanding national power generation 
and transmission capacities, South Africa engages 
in regional integration of energy systems with 
neighbouring countries. 
Box¬†3 gives an overview of the status and prospects 
of regional integration of energy systems in Southern 
Africa.
Box¬†3: Regional integration of energy systems in Southern African countries
Southern African countries are endowed with different types and quantities of energy resources. 
The regional integration of energy systems can provide a catalyst for the development of energy 
capacity in South Africa (for export), while imports can help expand or balance out domestic supplies. 
Specifically, the regional market can also provide a driver for the expansion of renewable energy capacity 
in South Africa (see e.g. IRENA, 2013). 
South Africa is a member of the Southern African Development Community (SADC). In 1995, the 
12 mainland countries of the SADC established the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP)¬π‚Å∂, which aims to 
promote regional co-operation in the production and trade of electricity, and to provide regional 
masterplans to guide the development of electricity generation and transmission infrastructure. 
Figure¬†3.10 shows the location of regional transmission corridors and power generation capacity from the 
SAPP Pool Plan 2017. 
Table 3.9 outlines the installed capacity from all sources of energy, net capacity and maximum demand in 
the countries of the SAPP in 2017‚Äì2018. It shows that South Africa contributes over three-quarters to the 
total regional installed capacity, operating capacity and maximum demand of all countries in the SAPP. 
South Africa also has the largest infrastructure for generation and transmission.

energy contributed 21.5% to the electricity generation mix of SAPP countries; most of this was from 
hydropower. Renewable energy technologies assume a much larger share in new-built generation capacity 
(e.g. around 54% in 2017) (SAPP, 2018), but the renewable resources in the region are still under-exploited, 
as illustrated by large gaps between total installed capacity and estimated potential (see Table 3.10). The 
SADC secretariat expects that the region could achieve a renewable energy share of at least 35% in power 
generation capacity by 2030, under current conditions (SADC and SARDC, 2013).
Table 3.10: Renewable energy estimated potential and capacity in the SADC region
Based on REN21 (2018)
In terms of concrete existing or potential trade of electricity in the region, South Africa signed a treaty for 
2 500 MW of hydropower by 2030 with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to facilitate RSA-DRC 
co-operation on the Inga Hydro Power Project (as reflected in the IRP). The project has the potential to 
energise and unlock regional industrialisation. Also, options exist for imports of hydroelectricity and natural 
gas from neighbouring Mozambique and for the export of power generated from solar PV and wind in 
South Africa, though this has not widely materialised in practice because most of the neighbouring 
countries also have very good solar (and some wind) resources and build capacity domestically. Overall, 
South Africa is expected to remain a net importer of power (mainly from the DRC and Mozambique).

3.4 Energy demand and access 
Energy access 
The current national electrification rate in South Africa 
is around 86% (in terms of the number of households 
connected to energy supply infrastructure). Significant 
progress was made in on-grid electrification between 
2005 and 2015, when 3.95¬† million households were 
electrified (Stats SA, 2016b). Table 3.11 presents the 
electrification rates by province as of March 2017. 
Most relative progress in recent years was made in 
Eastern Cape, Limpopo and KwaZulu-Natal which, as 
of March 2017, had achieved electrification rates of 
81%, 96% and 82%, respectively (DoE, 2017a). Yet there 
are still many localised areas with relatively low levels 
of access and, while the electrification rate increases 
across the country, funding and implementation 
capacity need to be priorities (DoE, 2017a).Energising rural households has two key components, 
namely accessibility and affordability, particularly of 
modern fuels that provide alternatives to traditional 
biomass. The ability of households to afford electricity 
once access to the grid infrastructure is provided is an 
important consideration.
The majority of un-electrified households are 
predominantly in rural areas of South Africa. In these 
areas, poverty is common, service delivery is often weak, 
and traditional biomass use remains widespread. The 
2011 census reported 27% of households (i.e. 4 million) in 
South Africa living in rural areas. Of these households, 
37% were using biomass as their main fuel for cooking, 
and 50% were using electricity as their main fuel for 
cooking (Stats SA, 2011). The percentage of households 
that used electricity for cooking increased to 78.1% in 
2015; yet, over 10% of the total number of households in 
South Africa still used biomass as their main fuel for 
cooking (Stats SA, 2016b). Rural households, in 
particular, typically use several thermal fuels, often using 
combinations of wood, electricity, paraffin and other 
fuels depending on access, location, weather, sociodemographic and various household socio-economic 
characteristics. 
As the population grows, degradation of the local 
environment is increasingly severe, and the time and 
labour spent on harvesting biomass is increasing. 
A major barrier to increased use of electricity for 
thermal purposes is the cost of electricity. More than 
half of South Africans were poor in 2015 and this 
status remains largely unchanged today. The poverty 
headcount increased to 55.5% in 2015 from a series 
low of 53.2% in 201116 (Stats SA, 2017). This translates 
into over 30.4¬†million South Africans living in poverty 
in 2015, which suggests serious affordability 
constraints for a large share of the South African 
population. To ensure a minimum level of energy 
services even for poor households, the government 
introduced a policy of FBE in 2003. According to this 
policy, an allocation of 50 kWh per month would be 
provided to all poor households connected to the 
grid. As of March 2015, the total number of customers 
configured for FBE was around 1.18¬†million, but only 
911 075 customers had collected their FBE tokens (EE 
Publishers, 2016b).
16 These figures are calculated using the upper-bound poverty 
line of ZAR¬†992 per person per month in 2015 prices (which 
translates to approximately USD¬†2.50 per person/day in 2015 
pricesbased on an exchange rate of ZAR1350 USD100)

Grid electrification is unlikely reach all households, 
especially those in remote rural areas, in the medium 
term. Off-grid solar home system (SHSs) are installed 
as a temporary alternative in areas that lie further 
than 2¬†kilometres from the grid and do not fall inside 
any areas earmarked in 3-year grid extension plans by 
either Eskom or the relevant municipality. Small-scale 
SHSs were installed in over 82 517 households from 
2002 to 2014 through an off-grid electrification 
programme implemented as a collaboration between 
the DoE (which was responsible for the programme) 
and the Department of Cooperative Governance and 
Traditional Affairs. 
The SHSs (generally 50‚Äì100¬† watts in size) can only 
deliver limited services and have been installed 
primarily in the Limpopo, Eastern Cape and KwaZuluNatal provinces, where grid connection is unlikely or 
uneconomical (DoE and GIZ, 2015).
The SHSs are installed primarily by private sector 
service providers, with municipalities playing a small 
role. The SHSs require no connection fee, but 
households are charged a fixed monthly service fee 
based on the business plan of the approved service 
provider. The systems include a 50-Watt Peak (Wp) 
panel (able to supply around 250 watt hour¬† (Wh)/
day), a charge controller, wiring and outlets for small 
appliances, a 105 amp-hour battery and four 
Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) (DoE, 2012).
Energy consumption by province
Within South Africa, provincial GDP (in terms of 
sectoral contributions and GDP growth), land area, 
climate and populations differ widely between 
provinces. These distinctions between provinces 
result in widely different fuel mixes, energy intensity 
levels and transport sector demand. The province 
with the highest overall electricity consumption is 
Gauteng (53 TWh) followed by KwaZulu-Natal and 
Mpumalanga (see Figure¬† 3.11). The Northern Cape 
has the lowest electricity demand. The province with 
the highest liquid fuel demand is also Gauteng whilst 
that with the lowest is Limpopo. 
Between 2004 and 2011, there appeared to be a 
slight decoupling of energy and economic growth in 
the large metropolitan areas. Economies in these 
areas grew by an average annual rate of 4.2%, 
whereas energy consumption grew by only 1.8%. The 
slight decrease in electricity use from 2007 to 2011 
seen in Figure¬†3.11 is attributable to supply-demand 
shortages and blackouts experienced over this 
period due to poor operational performance at 
power stations mainly due to maintenance backlogs 
at major power plants (see Box¬†2). Overall, electricity 
demand has been mostly stagnant in recent years. The stagnant electricity demand in South Africa, and 
particularly the decrease in electricity use observed 
from 2014, is underpinned by different factors: 
increasing energy efficiency driven by higher 
electricity tariffs, low overall economic growth, and 
an increasingly large share of less energy-intensive 
service sectors in the economy. As indicated above, 
the continued decrease in demand relative to 
economic growth may point to a decoupling of 
economic growth and energy use.

Key insight:Figure¬† 3.12 presents the diesel and petrol 
consumption by province for 2005‚Äì2015. Over this 
period, diesel consumption increased, while petrol fuel 
demand remained virtually unchanged. 
17 Note: There have been minor adjustments to provincial 
boundaries, with small implications for fuel use.
Contributing factors for the growth in diesel 
consumption, especially in 2012-2015, include the 
increased dominance of road-based freight over 
rail. Also, diesel is slightly cheaper than petrol and 
hence more private drivers have an incentive to 
purchase diesel-fuelled vehicles.

Key insight:In 2015, cities were home to 64% of South Africa‚Äôs 
population. Combined, they generated more than 
70% of the country‚Äôs wealth and were large energy 
consumers. Urbanisation in South Africa is taking 
place at a rapid pace. Forecasts show that the 
urban share of the population is likely to reach 70% 
by 2030 and 80% by 2050 (SEA, 2015). Cities in 
South Africa are poised to play an important role in 
sustainable development, driving change and 
ensuring national energy policies are met.
18 Based on the analyses undertaken by CSIR for comments 
on the draft IRP update 2016 (Wright et al., 2017a). CSIR 
analysis found that, from a least-cost optimal perspective, the 
penetration level of VRE in the South African power system by 
2030 was around 31%. With a lower demand forecast, the level 
was 24% (mostly due to a large component of the coal fleet 
still being online). CSIR found that 20‚Äì25% VRE by 2030 is 
least-cost optimal, but the national system could probably 
handle a significant amount more as new flexible capacity 
is deployed to complement variable renewables 
(Wright et al., 2017a).
3.5 Drivers for renewables 
in South Africa
Accelerated deployment of renewable energy and 
energy efficiency in South Africa is underpinned by 
several drivers, which are discussed in this section. 
Drivers are a combination of market factors and 
deliberate government efforts to support the 
development of renewable energy. 
Lower costs: The most compelling driver for renewables in South Africa is the gradually lower 
deployment cost that renewable energy has demonstrated through the stages of the 
REIPPPP. Bidding prices under the REIPPPP have decreased by over 50% for both solar PV 
and onshore wind since the launch of the procurement programme in 2011, and forecasts 
show that further cost reductions are possible (see Chapter 6 for further information). 
This is mainly due to high technology learning rates and market maturity/economies of 
scale. At present, both solar PV and onshore wind are cheaper than new-build coal on a 
pure LCOE basis in South Africa. This does not consider possible grid integration costs. 
VRE (i.e. solar PV, wind) grid penetration levels in South Africa are rather low (i.e. below 
10% of national generation) while the distribution system is expected to be able to handle a 
share of over 25% of the load from variable renewables by 2030 as more new flexible 
capacity is deployed to complement wind and solar PV (Wright et al., 2017a).18
Diversification: South Africa‚Äôs energy system is currently heavily dependent on coal. The power sector is 
dominated by large, centralised coal-based generation (see Chapter 4 for information on 
how coal is contracted to supply power generation). Diversifying into renewables can lower 
the severity of unplanned outages due to a more decentralised nature of generation and to 
better electricity price stability, which would be delinked from finiteness and pricing of fossil 
fuels. The environmental benefits of diversifying into renewables are discussed below.
Energy access: The percentage of households with grid-based electricity supply in South Africa increased 
from 77.1% in 2002 to over 86% in 2017. Further progress in energy access is largely being 
hampered by the high cost of providing electricity to remote rural households and the 
difficulty of providing electricity to predominantly informal or unplanned settlements. 
Alternative sources of energy are increasingly being deployed to expand access, and more 
emphasis is being placed on off-grid renewable energy solutions to improve energy access 
for remote areas that are difficult to service (see Chapter 3, Section 4). Besides these market drivers and central energy 
policy objectives, the reduction of environmental 
impacts from energy use is a key driver for 
accelerated deployment of renewable energy and 
energy efficiency. 
19 Note: The job estimate for CSP could be regarded as rather 
high given the low deployment levels of CSP compared to solar 
PV and wind in South Africa. 
The following section provides an overview of the 
environmental impacts of using renewable energy 
technologies, fossil fuels and nuclear power in the 
South African context.
Supply security: South Africa has experienced several years of tight electricity supply, with operating reserve 
margins well below the targeted 15% (Eskom, 2016b). These tight operating reserve margins 
and insufficient plant availability led to multiple rolling outages in 2008 and 2014, forcing 
Eskom to operate expensive peaking generation units (namely, diesel-fired OCGTs) at 
higher-than-expected levels as well as to load-shed on a rotational basis to balance the 
power system. This has led to significant economic losses for the South African economy. 
Renewables have had a positive impact during these times by helping to supply power 
during high demand periods, thereby lowering diesel fuel and operating costs as well as 
reducing the level of load-shedding required.
Customer choice: In an effort to contain rising electricity costs, customers are increasingly turning to 
renewables as an alternative option versus power supplied by the national utility or via the 
distribution grid owned by the local municipality. Renewables are also seen as a remedy 
for potential power supply interruptions, particularly if deployed in combination with 
battery technology. However, battery storage is still rather expensive, and as such, not 
many customers have been able to use it.
Job creation: The renewable energy sector is regarded as more labour intensive than the conventional 
energy sector (IRENA, 2018b). While not an explicit driver, job creation can therefore be 
regarded an important benefit of renewables deployment. The REIPPPP has demonstrated 
the potential for localisation and job creation. To date, the programme has succeeded in 
delivering more job years ‚Äì defined as the equivalent of a personyear of full-time 
employment ‚Äì than was anticipated, providing employment to some of the most 
impoverished areas in South Africa. By December 2018, the 63 projects that had 
successfully completed construction had delivered 52% more job years than planned, with 
29 620 job years achieved (DoE, DNT and DBSA, 2018a). In line with these observations, 
IRENA (2018b) estimates that South Africa has generated a total of 15 000 jobs in solar 
PV, close to 8 900 jobs in the CSP industry, 10 400 jobs in the wind sector, and some 
employment in the small hydro sector, overall amounting to a total of close to 35 000 
renewable energy sector jobs.19 Generally, though, long-term job creation postconstruction is so far limited in South Africa and, as the renewable energy sector grows, 
the aspiration is that more permanent jobs can be created.Reduction of environmental impacts 
as driver
One of the key policy drivers for investment in 
renewables in South Africa is environmental policy. 
This section outlines major environmental impacts 
from renewable energy use. The net environmental 
impact of renewables use depends on the type of 
liquid fuel production that is substituted. In the 
national power sector, renewables generally displace 
coal production and coal-based generation. 
Environmental benefits of renewable
energy (displacing coal)
Reduced negative impacts on agricultural land 
Only 1.5% of South Africa‚Äôs land surface consists of 
fertile agricultural land; 46.4% of this land is located in 
Mpumalanga Province, which is also the location of 
most of the country‚Äôs currently exploited coal 
deposits. Currently, 12% of this land is subject to coal 
mining activities, with an additional 13.4% subject to 
mining licence applications. The substitution of coal 
with renewables can avoid long-term land damage 
from mining activity and make fertile land available 
for agricultural use (DEA, 2011a). 
Reduced emissions and local air pollution
Overall, approximately 80% of South Africa‚Äôs GHG 
emissions originate in the energy sector, mostly from 
combustion of coal (DEA, 2017b). Methane emissions 
from coal mining in 2010 were estimated to be 
2.27¬†Mt of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO‚ÇÇ-eq) based 
on global warming potential over a 100-year time 
horizon (DEA, 2011a). Deploying larger shares of 
renewables can reduce mining-based emissions of 
methane, emissions arising from liquid fuels used in 
the mining process, as well as indirect emissions from 
use of coal-based electricity. 
As a result of coal combustion in power plants, boilers 
and synthetic fuels plants, the central areas where 
coal fields are situated have extremely high pollution 
levels and have been declared ‚Äúpriority areas‚Äù for 
action on air quality by the DEA. As these installations 
are phased out over the long term and renewable 
energy options take their place, local air pollution can 
be greatly reduced. 
Reduced impact on water resources 
South Africa is a water-scarce country. This was 
illustrated when, in 2018, the City of Cape Town had 
to enact drastic measures to reduce water use to 
avoid running out of water. Water scarcity is expected 
to be further aggravated by the impacts of global 
temperature rise. Electricity production (excluding 
water for mining) currently utilises around 2% of South 
Africa‚Äôs water. Coal power plants in particular require 
large quantities of water for evaporative cooling. A 
transition to onshore wind and solar PV can assist 
with reducing the water footprint of the power sector 
(e.g. solar PV technology uses only minimal amounts 
of water, which is required for panel cleaning).
Specific environmental impact of coal in
relation economic activities in South Africa
Disruptions to local hydrology and significant 
impacts on local water resources 
Coal production requires water for washing, 
beneficiation and dust suppression. Added to this is 
the problem of acid mine drainage, which has severe 
and long-lasting impacts on local water resources 
and, if unchecked, regional catchments. Acid mine 
drainage is regarded as a particularly serious 
environmental problem due to the high toxicity of the 
drainage itself and the persistence of the problem 
long after mines have ceased to function. Acid mine 
drainage and the threat to water resources is a high 
action priority in South Africa, particularly in the 
Gauteng area, with rehabilitation costs estimated to 
run into the hundreds of millions of rand (McCarthy, 
2011), or tens of millions of dollars. Spontaneous combustion of abandoned 
coal mines and coal dumps 
Due to the volatility of coal deposits and increased 
access to oxygen provided by mine workings, various 
abandoned coal mines in South Africa have been 
burning for some time¬†‚Äì¬†in some cases for decades. In 
addition to this, most South African coal mines 
contain large stockpiles of ‚Äúdiscard‚Äù coal (i.e. coal with 
a calorific value too low for commercial use). Some of 
these stockpiles have been burning for long periods. 
Uncontrolled surface or underground coal fires lead to 
several serious environmental impacts, including local 
air pollution as well as GHG emissions, and a collapse 
of surface layers. GHG emissions from combustion in 
abandoned coal mines are currently not accounted for 
in South Africa‚Äôs national GHG inventory (see DEA, 
2017b), and there are very few estimates for emissions 
from coal fires ‚Äì Cook and Lloyd (2012), one of the 
only studies of coal fires, estimate that emissions from 
coal fires contribute an additional 2¬† Mt annually to 
national emissions (‚âà0.5% of the current 390¬† Mt of 
total CO‚ÇÇ emissions per year). 
Waste disposal 
South Africa is highly dependent on coal as an energy 
option for the production of both electricity (Eskom) 
and petrochemicals (Sasol), which subsequently results 
in the production of large volumes of ash from the two 
major operations. Eskom generates about 
3 336¬† million¬† tonnes/year of mostly pulverised coal 
boiler ash and Sasol generates 1 011¬† million¬† tonnes/
year of mostly clinker ash from the gasification process 
(dti, 2019). This poses significant waste management 
challenges unless viable reuse options are developed.20
20 Potential for re-use exists in concrete and brick and block 
making, and different initiatives exist in South Africa to 
improve re-use. In 2017, the DEA hosted a Chemicals and 
Waste Economy Operation Phakisa that identified coal ash, 
amongst other outcomes, as a priority waste stream and set a 
higher annual country utilisation target of approximately 30% 
(10¬†million tonnes) by 2022. Large-scale ash utilisation 
initiatives identified by Phakisa include use as a sub-base for 
road construction, soil amelioration and mine backfilling. In 
terms of concrete government activities, the Department of 
Trade and Industry (dti) participates in the South African 
Bureau of Standards (SABS) Technical Committee to facilitate 
the development of the South African National Standards 
(SANS) standard for coal ash as concrete aggregate use, and 
the DEA continues to commission other studies jointly with 
industry as part of further sector interventions (dti, 2019).
Environmental impacts from processing
and use of other fossil fuels
Environmental impacts from the processing and use 
of other fossil fuels are potentially significant but 
dwarfed by the environmental impact of coal-based 
activities. Currently, natural gas and crude oil are 
produced in small amounts off the southern coast, 
with negligible environmental impacts, mostly due to 
the small scale of production. There are proposals to 
explore the recovery of unconventional gas resources 
in the Karoo Basin, which could have significant 
impacts on the scarce water resources in the Karoo, 
both in terms of increased water demand and of 
potential leakage of toxic chemicals into underground 
water resources. These potential impacts have led to 
extensive stakeholder engagement around new 
fracking regulations for South Africa.21
Crude oil and refined petroleum products are imported, 
and crude oil is refined in four refineries (three at the 
coast and one in-land). The key environmental impacts 
are local air pollution, especially in the south Durban 
area. Natural gas is imported from the region via 
pipeline, and environmental impact is limited to fugitive 
emissions and GHG emissions from combustion. A 
synthetic fuels Gas-to-Liquid plant in Mossel Bay has 
capacity for 36 000 barrels per day and uses gas 
produced off the southern coast as a feedstock.
The expected environmental impacts from increased 
deployment of renewables per the REmap Options 
(compared to the Reference Case 2030) are presented 
in Chapter 7 of this study. 
21 The South African government generally supports 
investigations for more accurate estimation of its domestic 
shale gas resources; this may include fracking, provided it is 
done in an environmentally sustainable manner. In the remarks 
by the Minister of Energy to the Gas-to-Power Congress 2018 
held in Cape Town, shale gas resources in South Africa are 
seen as a significant opportunity to boost economic growth, 
employment and investment. The Department of Mineral 
Resources had proposed ‚ÄúRegulations for Petroleum 
Exploration and Production (Fracking Regulations)‚Äù for South 
Africa; however, the regulations were declared invalid by the 
Eastern Cape High Court on 17¬†October 2017 (Go Legal, 2017).4 CURRENT LEGISLATIVE, REGULATORY 
AND POLICY FRAMEWORK
KEY POINTS
‚óè The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa 
(RSA) and other key laws and regulations directly 
or indirectly provide for the energy sector.
‚óè The DoE, Eskom and the National Energy Regulator 
of South Africa (NERSA) play the key institutional 
roles in the management of the energy sector, 
including the advancement of renewables. There is 
increasing power sector liberalisation, which means 
increased competition within the national power 
generation space.
‚óè The national grid is 100% owned and managed by 
Eskom with a 20-year Strategic Grid Plan. For 
embedded generation, the relevant institutions are 
the municipalities, Eskom, NERSA and the buyer of 
the generated electricity.
‚óè The IRP and IEP are the key policy instruments 
for planning the country‚Äôs energy needs, and 
for identifying technology options for energy 
supply and the costs associated with meeting 
projected demand. Both are intended as ‚Äúliving 
documents‚Äù that are updated regularly.
‚óè The White Paper on Renewable Energy of 2003 
is the most comprehensive policy document 
pertaining to the government‚Äôs vision on 
renewable energy. The REIPPPP placed 
renewables in the limelight.
‚óè The range of GHG emissions in the RSA is 
projected to reach a maximum level between 
2020 and 2025. Thereafter, the trajectory is 
projected to remain flat for ten years and to start 
declining in 2036. This is referred to as PeakPlateau-Decline GHG emissions trajectory.
This chapter provides an account of how the 
legislation and policy framework for the energy 
sector evolved in South Africa after the end of 
apartheid in 1994. This narrative gives particular 
attention to the key actors and processes in the 
national energy sector, and the way in which 
renewable energy rose to prominence in the energy 
landscape. The chapter also assesses how legislation 
and policy can further promote sound renewable 
energy deployment. 
4.1 Constitutional and legal 
framework
In South Africa, the Constitution is the overarching 
legal instrument that guides all laws and policies 
adopted by the government. Since 1994, the 
legislative and policy framework relating to the 
national energy sector has evolved significantly, 
including changes that are aimed at promoting the 
growth of the renewable energy industry. A summary 
of the major milestones in the evolution of the 
legislative framework for the South African energy 
sector is presented in Table 4.1.22 For a comprehensive overview, please refer to the 
State of renewable energy in South Africa 2015 report 
(DoE and GIZ, 2015).

Regulatory Framework

Whole document (see Chapter 4, Section 1 of this study). Structure of the South African Electricity 
Supply Industry 
Under the legal framework described above, the 
South African Electricity Supply Industry (ESI) has 
introduced more private sector participation, 
especially over the last five to ten years as more 
renewable energy projects have been implemented. 
To date, the general structure of the industry still 
remains with the national utility, Eskom, dominating 
power generation, transmission, and distribution as 
depicted in Figure¬† 4.1 below. Most of the 
electricitygenerated nationally is physically fed into 
the national transmission network prior to distribution. 
Commercially, the purchase of bulk electricity is done 
through the Eskom Single Buyer Office (SBO). The 
SBO makes the purchase decision from competing 
generation units based on various considerations. 
Key factors include cost and the nature of the PPA 
between the generator and the SBO. In terms of 
renewable energy, however, the DoE decides which 
projects to procure energy from. The procurement 
decision by the DoE IPP Office is exercised through 
the REIPPPP where renewable energy projects are 
chosen as preferred bidders and ultimately granted 
the ability to sell their generated power to Eskom.
Despite the dominant role of Eskom, increased 
competition is occurring within the generation space. 
Only a few municipalities in South Africa have a 
generation license, typically for a specific power plant 
within their jurisdiction. Municipalities in South Africa 
do not commonly have generation licenses, and these 
can be regarded as exceptional cases occurring in large 
municipalities or within metropolitan areas. In 2016, out 
of more than 200 South African municipalities, only 16 
had generation licenses.

Distribution
MunicipalitiesMunicipalities have the executive authority for electricity 
service delivery, distribution, and reticulation; however, 
many customers are supplied directly by Eskom as some 
municipalities do not provide electricity reticulation 
services and rely on Eskom as a distributor. Although both 
Eskom and municipalities are active at the distribution 
level, there is no direct competition for end-users. Rather, 
end-users are served by either of the distributors 
depending on various factors, including location. 
Parallel to greater participation from renewable energy 
IPPs, SSEG is spurring competition within both the 
generation and the distribution space. Generation 
companies are seeing slight decreases in market share due 
to embedded generation, while distributors (particularly 
municipalities) are being forced to rethink their business 
models due to embedded generation potentially reducing 
the use of their distribution grid networks. 
Key players in the South African 
Electricity Supply Industry
In addition to Eskom and municipalities, there are 
several other entities that are essential for proper 
functioning of the ESI within the sector‚Äôs legal 
framework. The most important of these include the 
DoE, NERSA and the DEA. These key players and 
their respective roles in the ESI are further explained 
in the following sections.
DoE
The DoE is responsible for ensuring development, 
utilisation and management of South Africa‚Äôs energy 
sources. The Department comprises six divisions that 
address specific focus areas. Out of the six divisions, 
four directly impact the renewable energy sector, as 
described below:‚Ää23
23 The information presented is taken from the DoE website, 
www.energy.gov.za/.
Policy and
Planning:
The Policy and Planning division within the Department has the mandate to ensure 
evidence-based planning, policy setting and investment decisions in the energy sector to 
improve energy security through supply-side and demand-side management options and 
to increase competition through regulation. It spearheads development of the IRP and IEPs, 
which give guidance on the share of renewable energy to be brought into the electricity 
and energy mix, respectively, over the long term.
Petroleum &
Petroleum
Products
Licensing:
The Petroleum division within the Department has the mandate to manage the regulation 
of petroleum and petroleum products to ensure optimum and orderly functioning of 
the petroleum industry for the achievement of the government‚Äôs development goals. 
The division is pivotal in driving initiatives for biofuels deployment into the mainstream 
petroleum supply value chain. 
Special
Programmes and
Project
Management:
The Special Programmes and Project Management division is in charge of managing, 
co-ordinating and monitoring programmes and projects focused on access to energy. Its 
flagship programme is the Integrated National Electrification Programme (INEP) of 2013 
(see DoE [2015b] for further information). Over half of the DoE budget is earmarked for the 
INEP. Where grid-based electricity access is not feasible under the INEP, renewables-based 
interventions are used. Hence, the INEP is an important platform for further deployment 
of renewables.
Clean Energy: This division manages and facilitates the development and implementation of clean 
and renewable energy initiatives, energy efficiency, and demand-side management. 
It spearheads targeted initiatives for renewables such as the South African Wind Energy 
Programme and the Wind Atlas of South Africa Project (WASA), production of the State 
of Renewable Energy in South Africa reports and participates in the National Biogas 
Platform, which is a collaboration between public entities, the private sector, and 
development agencies.NERSA
The mission of NERSA is to regulate the energy 
industry in accordance with the government's laws, 
policies, standards and international best practices in 
support of sustainable development. 
Under Chapter¬† II, Section¬† 4 of the Electricity 
Regulation Act of 2006, the key roles entrusted to 
NERSA are to:
‚óè Issue generation, transmission and distribution 
licensing (and set pertinent conditions).
‚óè Set and/or approve tariffs and prices.
‚óè Monitor and enforce compliance with licensing 
conditions.
‚óè Resolve disputes, including mediation, arbitration 
and handling of complaints.
‚óè Gather, store and disseminate industry 
information.
‚óè Set rules, guidelines, standards and codes.
‚óè Register import and production activities.
Among these roles, the setting of electricity tariffs is a 
pivotal role that NERSA performs, particularly in light 
of the overall economic impact and the effect that 
conventional electricity prices have on the prospects 
for deployment of renewable energy. NERSA sets 
electricity tariffs on a multi-year basis through a 
process called the Multi-Year Price Determination 
(MYPD). Under the MYPD, the national utility presents 
forecasts over the coming determination period for all 
costs to be incurred in ensuring reliable and adequate 
power supply. These costs, combined with a regulated 
return on investment on the utility asset base, allows 
Eskom to arrive at a revenue requirement. NERSA 
assesses the cost forecasts, interrogates the revenue 
requirements, and makes a judgement on the fairness 
of the revenue application in terms of prices for the 
final consumer and the sustainability of Eskom. With 
the revenue allowance determined, Eskom then 
translates the outcome into annual tariff increases for 
its different customer classes. Figure¬† 4.2 provides a 
simple schematic overview of the MYPD process.

Electricity Pricing Policy of 2008 (Government Notice 
No. 1398 of 2008), which is mainly implemented by 
NERSA (DME, 2008). The Policy provides guiding 
principles and an overall framework for determining 
electricity prices. Guiding principles include, among 
others, environmentally sustainable short-term and 
long-term usage of natural resources, accelerated 
access to electricity for the disadvantaged, efficient 
use of electricity as a scarce resource, lowered cost 
of electricity as input to economic activity, and more 
renewable energy generation in the energy mix 
(DME, 2008).
DEA 
In terms of the legal framework, the DEA acts as the 
custodian of environmental policy for the country. The 
DEA exerts its policy impact in two main domains of 
key relevance to renewable energy deployment: 
climate change and the natural environment.
With regard to climate change, the DEA spearheads 
efforts to formulate and implement South Africa‚Äôs 
contributions to international efforts for climate 
change mitigation, including development of the NDC 
for South Africa under the Paris Agreement. The DEA 
is also the national lead for drafting the Climate 
Change Bill, which proposes the legal framework for 
addressing the national climate challenge. 
With regard to the natural environment, the 
principal/applicable legislation with regard to the 
construction of any major infrastructure is the 
National Environmental Management Act (Act 
No.¬†107 of 1998). Determining whether any proposed 
energy infrastructure project is compliant with the 
relevant regulations is done through completing 
environmental impact assessments (EIAs) that 
comprise investigation of impacts on natural 
vegetation, water resources, air quality, ambient 
noise, heritage sites and aviation air space.
Legislation covering deployment of 
renewables in power, transport and 
building sectors
Specific legal instruments in South Africa make 
provisions for the deployment of renewable energy. 
The National Energy Act (Act No. 34 of 2008), the 
Biofuels Regulatory Framework, and the Green 
Building regulations are the most prominent 
instruments regarding the power sector, liquid fuels 
(i.e. transport fuel sector) and buildings sector, 
respectively. The three legal instruments are 
described in detail below.
At present, there are no legal instruments that 
specifically address heat demand. Under the NEES, 
however, targets are set for improved energy 
efficiency in the industrial sector, among others (see 
Chapter 3, Section 3 and Chapter 7, Section 1 for 
further information on the NEES). National Energy Act of 2008
The National Energy Act (Act 34 of 2008) spells out 
the need for increased generation and consumption 
of renewable energy. This legal instrument empowers 
the DoE to undertake certain measures to ensure 
energy security, including integrated energy planning, 
energy research and collection of information 
regarding energy generation, supply and demand. 
The National Energy Act tasks the Minister of Energy 
to develop and publish an Integrated Energy Plan (see 
Chapter 4, Section 2). 
South African Biofuels Regulatory Framework 
of 2014
The DoE has published a Draft Position Paper on the 
South African Biofuels Regulatory Framework, with 
the aim of initiating an enabling national regulatory 
environment for the biofuels industry (Notice 24 of 
2014) (DoE, 2014b). This draft framework includes 
the regulation of mandatory blending of biofuels with 
petrol and diesel and the licensing of biofuels 
producers. The framework was presented to the 
cabinet for consideration but was not endorsed (as of 
February 2019). Regulations on blending of biofuels 
are proposed to allow for a minimum concentration of 
5% volume/volume (v/v) for blending biodiesel with 
diesel, and for a concentration of 2% to 5% v/v for 
blending bioethanol with petrol. 
Licensed manufacturers of petroleum fuels are 
obliged to buy biofuels only from licensed 
manufacturers. Biofuels producers need to be 
licensed by the Petroleum Products Controller. 
Green building regulations
In line with the provisions of the National Building 
Regulations and Building Standards Act (Act No.¬† 29 
of 1996), a policy framework on green buildings was 
developed in 2011; the policy was launched in 
October 2018 (Government of South Africa, 2018). 
One of the strategic pillars of this framework was to 
adopt green building regulations, standards and best 
practices. Various aspects of the green buildings 
legislation were outlined under this strategic pillar. 
Among other things, the draft policy framework 
identified the need to adopt new building regulations 
and standards that could foster an increased 
exploitation of resource-efficient designs and 
technologies, and sustainable utilisation of natural 
resources. In this regard, South Africa has a national 
standard on energy efficiency in the built 
environment¬†‚Äì¬†SANS 204:2011 (SABS, 2011b)¬†‚Äì¬†which 
specifies requirements for energy efficiency and 
services in buildings. Comprehensive building 
regulations are also contained in the SANS¬† 10400 
regulations (SABS, 2011a). 
This set of building regulations includes components 
on Environmental Sustainability (SANS¬†10400-X) and 
Energy Usage in Buildings (SANS¬† 10400-XA). The 
SANS¬†204 became optional when the SANS¬†10400-X 
and SANS¬† 10400-XA standards came into effect 
because energy usage in buildings includes energy 
efficiency. There is also a standard (SANS¬†1307) that 
specifies requirements for solar water heaters (SABS, 
2014a) that can promote the utilisation of renewable 
energy in the built environment. Other initiatives on 
green buildings have been taken by the Green 
Building Council South Africa (GBCSA).24
24 The GBCSA is a non-profit company that was formed in 2007 
to promote, encourage and facilitate green building in the RSA. 
GBCSA has developed the Green Star SA rating system, which 
is in effect; GBCSA serves as the official certification body. 4.2 Policy framework
A policy framework assists in promoting the vertical 
alignment and the horizontal harmonisation of key 
government and political commitments. Various 
national and sector policies need to be considered 
within planning for energy supply and demand. 
A summary of the major milestones in the evolution 
of the policy framework for the South African 
energy sector since 1994 is presented in Table 4.2. 
A summary of the context and provisions of key 
policies is provided under the table.

use of renewable energy (Section 6.5 of the policy) (DPW, 
2011). The Green Building Policy was launched at the annual 
GBCSA Convention in October 2018 (Government of South 
Africa, 2018).White Paper on Renewable Energy 
of 2003
The White Paper on Renewable Energy was 
formulated and came into effect in 2003 (DME, 
2003). It is the most comprehensive policy document 
pertaining to the government‚Äôs vision on renewable 
energy. It informs institutions of roles, encourages 
the use of renewable energy technologies and 
stimulates market investment in renewable energy 
technologies. The Renewable Energy White Paper 
set a target of 10 000 GWh of electricity to be 
generated from renewable energy resources by 
2013, but it did not specify how this target would be 
met (DME, 2003). This target has been revised 
through the IRP (see below) and the target period 
was extended to 2030.

(DST, 2013).
2016 Draft Integrated Energy 
Plan (IEP) 
Pending 
approval 
One of the key objectives of the IEP is to ensure adequate, 
sustainable and reliable forms of energy for end-consumers 
(Section 1.4 of the Draft IEP). In this vein, the policy recognises renewable energy as one of the primary sources of energy (Section 2.1.5 of the Draft IEP). The plan covers the whole 
energy sector (electricity and other forms of energy) over a 
time horizon of up to 2050 (DoE, 2016a).
2017 Industrial Policy Action 
Plan (IPAP)
In effect IPAP includes three important milestones that have 
been achieved by domestic Green Industries (dti, 2017), 
namely: 
i) A total of 6 376 MW of electricity had been procured 
by October 2016 under the REIPPPP; 
ii) The REIPPPP attracted a total investment value of 
ZAR¬†194.1 billion (USD¬†14¬†bn); and 
iii) Green Industries created 28 484 job years and 
generated ZAR 256.2 million (USD 18 million) in 
socio-economic development contributions and 
ZAR¬†80.5¬†million (nearly USD 6 million) in enterprise 
development contributions. 
2018 Draft Integrated 
Resource Plan (IRP) 
update 
Pending 
approval
The 2018 IRP draft provides an update to the IRP 2010‚Äì2030. 
The draft policy update incorporates government objectives 
on carbon mitigation and decarbonisation of the electricity 
sector in South Africa (Section 2 of the draft IRP). The 
simulation of scenarios of the energy supply includes GHG 
constraints and renewable energy cap removal (Section 6 of 
the draft IRP). These aspects allow higher shares of renewable energy. The plan covers a time horizon of up to 2050 
(DoE, 2018b). The IRP focuses on the electricity sector only. National Energy Efficiency Strategy 
(NEES) of 2005
The Government of South Africa through the 
Department of Minerals and Energy released the first 
NEES in 2005. This strategy aimed to respond to the 
increasing demand for energy alongside a growing 
commitment to improving resource use and reducing 
South Africa‚Äôs national environmental footprint. The 
NEES derived its mandate from the White Paper on 
Energy Policy (1998). A National Energy Efficiency 
Action Plan was developed in 2012 detailing the 
implementation of the strategy. In December 2016, the 
post-2015 draft NEES was gazetted, with a time 
horizon to 2030. This post-2015 strategy considers the 
current economic and development context in South 
Africa and aims to encourage continued growth by 
reducing energy inefficiency. The targets for reductions 
in energy intensity by sector are presented in Chapter 
3, Section 1 of this study (for the framework to 2015) 
and Chapter 7 (for the post-2015 draft NEES). 
Integrated Resource Plan (IRP)
The IRP is intended to be a key policy instrument for 
planning the country‚Äôs future electricity needs, and for 
identifying technology options for generating capacity 
and the costs associated with meeting projected 
demand. The IRP results are obtained through the use 
of a least-cost optimisation model. Once the least-cost 
electricity supply mix under ‚Äúnormal‚Äù conditions has 
been determined, model adjustments are then made to 
test implications of specific policy interventions for 
national objectives such as job creation, localisation, 
etc. The varied combinations of policy interventions are 
modelled and reported as ‚Äúscenarios‚Äù. Since policy 
objectives introduce certain constraints or targets in 
the model, the different scenarios feature different 
electricity mix outcomes.
The IRP 2010‚Äì2030 was promulgated in May 2011 
and covers capacity expansion up to 2030. The IRP 
2010‚Äì2030 calls for update/revision every two years. 
The draft IRP update 2016 and draft IRP update 
2018, both described in this study, are updates to 
the IRP 2010‚Äì2030. 
In the draft IRP update 2016, new capacity for 
renewable energy was planned to be 17.3¬† GW and 
57.5¬† GW by 2030 and 2050, respectively, under the 
Base Case scenario (DoE, 2016d). The aspiration for 
greater diversification and the gradual increase in the 
national share of renewable energy, especially as the 
result of steep cost declines, is also reflected in the 
draft IRP 2018 update (see Chapter 5 for more 
information). Its objective is to develop a sustainable 
electricity investment strategy for generation capacity 
and supporting infrastructure for South Africa over 
the next 20 years. 
Meanwhile, until the updated IRP document comes 
into effect, the IRP 2010‚Äì2030 continues to be the 
official government plan for the electricity sector. As 
outlined, the IRP focuses on power sector planning 
only and does not provide a roadmap for all other 
energy-use sectors. This leads to the concept of an 
integrated energy plan (IEP) that covers the entire 
energy sector. 
Integrated Energy Plan (IEP)
The development of an IEP was envisaged in the White 
Paper on Energy Policy of 1998 and is enshrined in the 
National Energy Act of 2008. The IEP is the national 
umbrella plan which, among others, guides policy 
development in South Africa, sets the framework for 
regulations and informs the selection of technologies to 
meet future energy demand. In scope, the IEP covers 
the entire energy sector and considers all elements of 
the energy value chain. It therefore integrates the IRP 
(i.e. electricity sector plan) that provides one of the 
sub-sections of the IEP. The purpose of the IEP is to provide a roadmap for 
the future energy landscape in South Africa that 
guides future energy infrastructure investments and 
policy development. It should have a planning 
horizon of not less than 20 years. The development 
of the IEP is meant to be a continuous process 
because it needs to be reviewed annually to account 
for changes in the macro-economic environment, 
technological innovations, national priorities and 
other developmental factors. The base year 2015 
data and the 2030 Reference Case in this study are 
both taken from the Base Case of the draft IEP 2016. 
An updated IEP, to which the draft IRP 2018 update 
provides an input, is pending development.
Biofuels Industrial Strategy of South 
Africa of 2007
Published in 2007, the Biofuels Industrial Strategy of 
South Africa set a target of achieving 2% penetration 
of biofuels (estimated to be approximately 400¬†million 
litres) in the national liquid fuels mix by 2013 (DME, 
2007a). To stimulate agriculture in under-developed 
agricultural areas, sugar cane, sugar beet and 
sorghum were recommended as feedstocks for 
bioethanol, and soya beans, sunflower and canola 
were recommended as feedstocks for biodiesel. 
Biodiesel was to receive a rebate of 50% on the fuel 
tax, and bioethanol would be 100% fuel tax exempt. 
The Biofuel Industrial Strategy has facilitated the 
development of the regulations regarding mandatory 
blending of biofuels with petrol and diesel and criteria 
for licenses to manufacture biofuels, both of which 
came into effect (see Chapter 4, Section 1 of this 
study). However, there has been little progress in this 
sector over the years mainly due to concerns about 
the possible impacts of biofuels on food security; 
these concerns have been further exacerbated by 
frequent drought experiences.
Low global oil prices in recent years have also been a 
significant influencing factor, particularly since they 
made biofuels less economically attractive as a 
potential substitute for conventional fossil-based 
liquid fuels (while high oil prices make biofuels a more 
attractive alternative). More recent plans and 
strategies that directly promote renewable energy in 
the transportation sector include the National 
Transport Master Plan 2050 (Department of Transport, 
2016) and the Green Transport Strategy (Department 
of Transport, 2017).
4.3 Policy instruments
Procurement of energy (in all its forms) occurs within 
a wider overall national framework that influences 
the policy instruments used. Although the renewable 
energy sector is still nascent in South Africa, there is 
already a track record of instruments deployed to 
promote their deployment. The instruments 
described in this section are auctions, tariffs and 
emissions targets.
Renewable energy feed-in tariffs (REFITs) 
and REIPPPP
The Renewable Energy White Paper 2003 sought to 
increase the production of energy from renewable 
resources. In the context of this objective, the first 
stage of attempts for implementation started with the 
introduction of a renewable energy and finance 
subsidy scheme that provided support to at least six 
projects. Through this scheme, the Department of 
Energy offered about ZAR¬†14.95¬†million (i.e. roughly 
USD¬†1.07¬†million based on an exchange rate of ZAR¬†14 
= USD¬† 1) to small-scale hydro, landfill and wind 
projects with a total capacity of 23.9 MW between 
2005 and 2010 (see Table 4.3).Following on the success of this programme, in 2009 
NERSA made proposals on REFIT rates in an attempt 
to facilitate large-scale, grid-connected renewable 
energy from IPPs (Baker, 2011; Eberhard, Kolker and 
Leigland, 2014). Indeed, the NERSA published feedin tariffs for wind, small hydro, landfill gas and CSP 
in March 2009 (see Table 4.4) (NERSA, 2009a). 
Before any PPAs were concluded, however, NERSA 
published a consultation paper in July 2009 that 
called for lower feed-in tariffs.
Specifically, the paper called for tariffs between 13% 
and 41% lower than what had been proposed before, 
depending on the technology (NERSA, 2009b). 
Combined with some concerns that feed-in tariffs 
would amount to a non-competitive procurement 
process, which is against the Constitution of the 
RSA, this back-and-forth threw the nascent industry 
into disarray and led to the review and re-adaptation 
of the REFIT policy instrument in 2011 (Eberhard, 
Kolker and Leigland, 2014).

Based on NERSA (2009a)The second stage of implementation of the 
Renewable Energy White Paper of 2003 targets was 
the development of a competitive bidding process, 
i.e. the REIPPPP that was launched in 2011. As 
reported in Chapter 3, the REIPPPP has been able to 
contribute 3.9¬† GW in new operational renewable 
energy capacity to date, and an additional renewable 
energy capacity of 2.4¬†GW is to become operational 
under remaining successful projects from Bid 
Windows 14. The signing of PPAs for Bid Window 4 
was approved between the main parties ‚Äì¬†Eskom, the 
IPPs and the IPP Office¬†‚Äì¬†in May 2018. 
The National Solar Water Heating 
Programme (NSWHP)
Another significant initiative in the development of 
the national renewable energy subsector is the 
NSWHP of 2007. The installation of SWHs to supply 
domestic hot water has been touted by national and 
local governments as a means to improve the 
standard of living for poor households and as part of 
the demand-side management programmes. This 
programme kicked off with only a handful of suppliers 
in the country (numbers range from 9 to 20), little 
industry regulation and no minimum product or 
installation standards in place (Eskom, 2011). 
The DoE mandated Eskom as the implementing 
agency for the NSWHP in 2008. In that year, Eskom 
introduced the Solar Water Heating Rebate 
Programme, which resulted in an increased rate of 
SWH installations. By 2011, there were 122 
accredited suppliers, 351 registered distributors and 
180 registered independent installers (Eskom, 2011). 
After Eskom reduced the rebate rate from May 2011, 
installations dropped, but began picking up again 
later in that year, albeit more slowly. 
Between 2014 and September 2015, however, just 
over 400 000 SWHs (320 000 low-pressure and 
80 000 high-pressure units, respectively) had been 
installed in residential communities (Steyn, 2015). 
In response to this, the DoE terminated Eskom‚Äôs 
implementation mandate and took over responsibility 
for implementation of the NSWHP. Thereafter, the 
DoE planned to install 45 141 new SWH units for 
residential and commercial buildings during the 
2015/16 financial year; it actually achieved 5 000 
new units (DoE, 2016e). Overall, the DoE has 
procured a total of 87 206 Baseline Systems from 12 
manufacturers and has initiated the process of 
appointing service providers to install SWHs 
(DoE, 2018c).
Emissions targets
As reported in Chapter 3, South Africa has abundant 
reserves of coal, and most of the electricity is 
generated by coal-fired thermal plants. Overall, 
approximately 80% of South Africa‚Äôs GHG emissions 
originate in the energy sector, mostly from the 
combustion of coal. In this context, the country has 
committed to shift from business-as-usual to a policy in 
which the trajectory of GHG emissions to 2050 peaks 
(between 2020‚Äì2025), plateaus (until around 2036) 
and then declines (from 2036‚Äì2050), as specified in the 
National Climate Change Response White Paper (DEA, 
2011a; DEA, 2011b). Figure¬† 4.3 illustrates this 
trajectory, in terms of CO‚ÇÇ-equivalent (CO‚ÇÇ-eq) 
emissions per year). In South Africa‚Äôs NDC under the 
Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the trajectory is 
referred to as ‚ÄúPeak-Plateau-Decline‚Äù (PPD) GHG 
emissions trajectory (DEA, 2015). For more information 
on South Africa‚Äôs actions on climate change, see 
Climate Action Tracker (2017).Specifically, GHG emissions are expected to reach a 
maximum level between 2020 and 2025 in a range 
with a lower limit of 398 Mt CO‚ÇÇ-eq/yr and upper 
limits of 583 Mt CO‚ÇÇ-eq/yr and 614¬†Mt¬†CO‚ÇÇ-eq/yr for 
2020 and 2025, respectively. Thereafter, the level of 
GHG emissions will be flat for about ten¬†years within 
the range with a lower limit of 398¬†Mt CO‚ÇÇ-eq/yr and 
an upper limit of 614¬† Mt¬† CO‚ÇÇ-eq/yr. The declining 
trend will commence in 2036 within the range with a 
lower limit of 212¬†Mt CO‚ÇÇ-eq/yr and an upper limit of 
428¬† Mt CO‚ÇÇ-eq/yr by 2050. South Africa used these 
emission levels in its NDC document under the Paris 
Agreement on Climate Change (DEA, 2015). 
These targets were informed by the National 
Development Plan (NPC, 2011) and the 2011 National 
Climate Change Response White Paper and are 
consistent with the national pledge made under the 
Copenhagen Climate Accord of 2011.
Most of the GHG emissions in South Africa emanate 
from energy supply (electricity and liquid fuels) and 
consumption (mining, industry and transport). 
In view of this, mitigation actions with the greatest 
potential for emission reduction are focused on these 
areas (DEA, 2011a). Increasing the share of renewable 
energy in the energy supply mix and implementing 
energy efficiency on the demand side are the most 
promising options for reducing GHG emissions in the 
country. However, the present structure of the 
country‚Äôs economy is carbon-intensive and, therefore, 
many sectors require flexibility in the transition to a 
low-carbon economy. 
A national carbon tax has been planned since 2015. In 
the 2019 Budget Speech on 20¬† February 2019, the 
minister of finance reiterated the ambition to expand 
renewable energy and announced that the national 
carbon tax will come into effect from 1¬† June 2019 
(DNT, 2019). There is already a levy on CO‚ÇÇ emissions 
from new motor vehicles manufactured in South 
Africa, which became effective from 15¬†August 2014 
(South African Revenue Service, 2014).

20504.4 National grids and transmission 
As outlined in Chapter 3, the South African national 
grid is spatially concentrated around the coal mines 
and power plants in the northeast of the country and 
is 100% owned and managed by Eskom with a 20-year 
Strategic Grid Plan. This grid plan is intended to 
provide a framework for future infrastructure 
investments, and Eskom is required to produce an 
annually updated ten-year Transmission Development 
Plan as a guide to investment (see the 2016‚Äì2025 
Plan in Figure¬†3.8). 
The implementation of Eskom‚Äôs grid and transmission 
development plans are, in large part, facilitated by 
ensuring sufficient funding through the MYPD (see 
Chapter 4, Section 1 of this study) applications to 
NERSA. The Electricity Regulation Act of 2006 
provides the legal basis for the MYPD methodology 
(see NERSA, 2016) to determine Eskom‚Äôs allowed 
revenue. This is supplemented by the Electricity 
Pricing Policy of 2008, which guides NERSA‚Äôs approval 
of prices and tariffs for the ESI. The MYPD calculation 
takes into account the recovery of primary energy 
costs, operating and maintenance costs, invested 
capital, depreciation of any principal debt, return on 
assets and invested capital, and it also includes a risk 
management mechanism to address the risk of excess 
or inadequate returns (NERSA, 2016). See Chapter 4, 
Section 1 of this study for further details on the 
Pricing Policy and MYPD.
Eskom has faced challenges in integrating IPP projects 
into its grid because of congestion at some specific 
connection points in the grid. This challenge 
contributed to the delay in the financial close of Bid 
Window 3 of the REIPPPP and also the announcement 
of winning projects in Bid Window 4 (see also Chapter 
4, Section 3 of this study). Signing of the PPAs for the 
projects in Bid Window 4 was achieved in May 2018 
after a delay of over six¬†months. 
While IPPs could act as distributors and sell directly to 
customers in theory, there are considerable practical 
barriers to this arrangement. These obstacles include 
feeding into the physical transmission infrastructure 
owned by Eskom (IPPs encounter some difficulties in 
obtaining wheeling agreements) and accessing the 
distribution networks of Eskom and municipalities at 
competitive rates. Notwithstanding the absence of 
legislative prohibition, the licence conditions of 
existing IPPs do not permit them to sell electricity to 
third parties (DoE, DNT and DBSA, 2018a).
4.5 Institutional arrangements
Arrangement under the REIPPPP
Policies, regulations and provisions to increase the 
renewable energy share in the national energy mix 
cut across different institutions, both from 
government and the private sector. For example, 
the collaboration between Eskom, NERSA and the 
DoE saw a switch from the initial feed-in tariff 
approach to a competitive bidding process for 
procurement of utility-scale renewable energy 
generation (see Chapter 4, Section 3 for further 
information). The success of the REIPPPP has 
resulted in an unprecedented increase in private 
sector expertise and investment into gridconnected renewable energy in South Africa. As 
illustrated in Figure¬†4.4, the bankability of projects 
under the REIPPPP is secured through the terms 
and conditions of four non-negotiable agreements 
that involve five key institutions or stakeholders: 
the private sector IPP, lenders, the national utility 
Eskom, NERSA and the Government IPP Office 
(which itself is a partnership between the DoE, the 
National Treasury and the Development Bank of 
Southern Africa) (DoE, DNT and DBSA, 2018b; 
DoE, DNT and DBSA, 2018c). Arrangement under embedded 
generation
As outlined in Chapter 3, renewable energy is also 
attractive due to its potential for embedded 
generation capabilities, that help reduce potentially 
detrimental externalities associated with longdistance transmission. Often, municipalities are the 
owners and operators of distribution grid network 
infrastructure, while Eskom operates distribution 
grid infrastructure in other locations. Eskom 
distributes about 40% of all electricity to end 
consumers. 
As a result of this, consent from the municipalities or 
Eskom (distribution) must be sought for any 
embedded generation projects. Certain municipalities 
offer a feed-in tariff for excess generation from 
embedded generators. This tariff may only be offered 
with approval from the national regulator. The main 
relevant institutions for embedded generation are 
therefore the municipalities, Eskom (i.e. the 
distribution department), NERSA and the buyer of the 
electricity. The landscape of these key actors is 
illustrated in Figure¬†4.5.

Based on DoE, DNT and DBSA (2018b) and known REIPPPP attributesCo-operation and alignment among 
institutions for renewable energy 
deployment
The effective integration and distribution of higher 
shares of electricity from renewable energy will require 
co-ordination among Eskom, NERSA, municipalities 
and the DoE. Electricity distributors have to be licensed 
by NERSA; by 2014, a total of 188 distributors were 
licensed (SALGA, 2014). Electricity services from 
renewable energy for development-related planning 
purposes can be included by municipalities to ensure 
the provision of efficient and sustainable services that 
are affordable. 
According to SALGA (2014), ‚Äúthere may be real or 
perceived conflict in law between the right of the 
municipality to determine tariffs for municipal services 
(including electricity) in terms of Municipal System Act 
and power of regulator to approve electricity tariffs in 
terms of the Electricity Regulation Act‚Äù. The conflict in 
law between the tariff-setting authority and 
municipalities regarding electricity distribution is 
perceived to have a negative effect on municipalities‚Äô 
revenue generation and ability to manage outstanding 
debtors.

Compiled on the basis of SSEG rules (see NERSA, 2018)Arrangement under the petroleum 
industry 
The liquid fuels industry generally consists of the 
upstream segment (i.e. prospecting, exploration, 
extraction) and the downstream segment (i.e. refining, 
wholesaling, transmission and retailing). Within these 
segments, different institutions participate to ensure 
the security of supply and the sustainability of the 
sector, as well as fair pricing to end-consumers. 
Figure¬†4.6 below shows the institutions involved in the 
regulation of the sector and their respective roles. The 
clear distinctions between the authorities responsible 
for each segment need to be noted. The upstream 
portions of the sector are the domain of the Department 
of Mineral Resources, while the downstream activities 
are the domain of the DoE and NERSA (with NERSA 
presiding over pipelines only).

Note:5 REFERENCE CASE 2030 FOR 
SOUTH AFRICA
KEY POINTS
‚óè The Reference Case to 2030 provides a trajectory 
for the South African energy sector based on 
current government policy and plans. It is primarily 
based on the Base Case scenario of the draft IEP 
2016.
‚óè Under the Reference Case 2030, total final energy 
consumption (TFEC) in South Africa is projected to 
increase by 26%, from 2 290 PJ in 2015 to 2 856 PJ 
by 2030.
‚óè In the Reference Case 2030, coal continues to play 
a significant role in the 2030 energy mix (either by 
direct use or coal-based electricity generation) 
while petrol and diesel continue to be the dominant 
primary energy supply options for the transport, 
mining and agricultural sectors.
‚óè In the electricity sector, the share of renewable 
energy in electrical energy is expected to increase 
from ‚âà9% in 2015 to ‚âà37% by 2030 under the 
Reference Case (including imported hydro).
‚óè Under the Reference Case 2030, the share of 
renewable energy in TFEC is expected to move 
from ‚âà9% in 2015 to ‚âà13% by 2030.
‚óè Traditional biomass use in the residential sector 
is expected to be replaced by electricity as 90% 
of households are expected to be electrified via 
on-grid connections by 2030. Overall, the 
electrification rate is expected to increase to 97% 
by 2030, including an increase in off-grid 
connections in remote rural areas (likely enabled 
by a range of distributed energy technologies, 
including renewables).
‚óè In the Reference Case 2030, CO‚ÇÇ emissions are 
expected to increase by 17%, from ‚âà390¬† Mt in 
2015 to ‚âà450¬† Mt/yr by 2030. Increased CO‚ÇÇ 
emissions are mainly from the transport sector 
and from increased energy supply from fossilbased sources. The expected emissions are 
within boundaries of the Peak-Plateau-Decline 
trajectory.
The Reference Case to 2030 provides a projection of 
the South African energy sector based on current 
government policy and plans. It is primarily based on 
the Base Case scenario of the draft IEP 2016. The 
IEP (for the energy sector) and the IRP (for the 
electricity sector) are the two most important 
strategic plans in South Africa. As outlined in 
Chapter 4, updated draft versions of both the IEP 
and IRP are under development (see Box¬† 4 for an 
overview of the updated draft 2018 IRP). 
However, at the time of writing this study, the draft 
IEP 2016 was the latest existing national draft 
available from the DoE. The outcomes from the draft 
IEP 2016 Base Case are therefore used as basis for 
the Reference Case to 2030¬†(DoE, 2016a). 5.1. Developments in primary 
energy supply and TFEC 
Total primary energy supply (TPES)
The expected TPES for the Reference Case is 
summarised in¬† Figure¬† 5.1. TPES is expected to 
increase from 4 555 PJ in 2015 to 4 950 PJ by 2030. 
The TPES from coal is expected to decrease from 
3 048 PJ in 2015 to 2 714 PJ by 2030 (from ‚âà70% of 
TPES to 55% of TPES). The role of traditional biomass 
supply is also expected to decrease significantly, from 
127 PJ in 2015 to 4 PJ by 2030, whereas modern 
bioenergy (in the form of biogas) will grow from a 
negligible amount in 2015 to 20 PJ by 2030. Solar 
(including solar PV and solar thermal) and wind are 
expected to play a considerably larger role in primary 
energy supply in South Africa by 2030, increasing 
from 7 PJ and 18 PJ in 2015 to 216 PJ and 144 PJ by 
2030, respectively. Crude oil supply (largely imported) 
will remain at 727 PJ, while the TPES from petroleum 
products is expected to increase notably from 308 PJ 
in 2015 to 560 PJ by 2030. Natural gas in the TPES 
also increases considerably, from 99 PJ in 2015 to 
306 PJ by 2030. 
The total costs under the Reference¬† Case¬† 2030 are 
dominated by liquid fuel imports at 58% of total 
discounted energy system costs, electricity production 
at 23% and liquid fuels extraction/production at 
19%¬† (DoE, 2016f). The Reference Case 2030 features 
moderate economic growth expectations, of 1.3‚Äì3.7% 
annual economic growth to 2025 and 3.7‚Äì4.2% annual 
economic growth thereafter, until 2030.

1.1 √óThe CO‚ÇÇ emissions trajectory for the 
Reference¬† Case¬† 2030 is shown in¬† Figure¬† 5.2. The 
electricity sector accounts for the largest share of CO‚ÇÇ 
emissions. Under the Reference Case 2030, emissions 
from the power sector are expected to increase to 
2020 but not exceed the Peak-Plateau-Decline limit of 
275¬† Mt/yr from 2025 onwards, due to some 
diversification away from coal-based power supply. 
Overall, CO‚ÇÇ emissions under the Reference Case 
2030 are expected to increase by 17% relative to 2015. 
From 2020 onwards, emissions from the electricity 
sector stabilise and marginally decrease. The 
expected overall increase in CO‚ÇÇ emissions stems 
mainly from the transport sector (38¬† Mt in 2015 to 
51¬†Mt by 2030) and other energy uses outside of the 
power sector. Overall, the expected trajectory 
towards 2030 is within the boundaries of South 
Africa‚Äôs Peak-Plateau-Decline emissions trajectory 
(which defines a range of 398¬† Mt¬† CO‚ÇÇeq/yr ‚Äì 
614¬†Mt¬†CO‚ÇÇeq/yr between 2025 and 2035).

Under the Reference Case 2030, South Africa‚Äôs national CO‚ÇÇ emissions increase
by 17% from 2015 to 2030. The electricity sector accounts for 66% of total
energy sector CO‚ÇÇ emissions in 2015, and still slightly over 60% by 2030.
Key insight:Total final energy consumption¬†(TFEC)
TFEC by end-use sector in South Africa in the 
Reference Case 2030 is shown in Figure¬†5.3. TFEC in 
South Africa is expected to grow by 26%, from 
2 290 PJ in 2015 to 2 856 PJ by 2030. The largest 
growth is expected in the commercial sector 
(demand increase of 33%). 
Absolute energy consumption is expected to 
decrease in the residential sector largely due to an 
anticipated decline in traditional biomass use and 
switching to electricity. Small growth is expected 
in agricultural energy demand, from 69 PJ in 2015 
to 83 PJ by 2030.

Based on DoE (2016a)¬†
End-use by energy carrier is summarised in Figure 5.4. 
Liquid fuels (1 385 PJ by 2030) and coal (407 PJ by 
2030) are still expected to play a significant role in 
South Africa‚Äôs future energy mix. The role of coal will 
be via direct-use, for the synthesis of liquid fuels or via 
coal-based electricity generation (shown in Figure¬†5.5 
below). 
Electricity also continues to contribute significantly to 
energy end-use as an energy carrier (from 780 PJ in 
2015 to 973 PJ by 2030) but remains constant on a 
relative basis, at a share of around 34%, with significant 
absolute increases in residential and commercial enduse sectors. Natural gas for end-use remains largely 
unchanged at 86 PJ whilst that of traditional biomass 
nearly disappears by 2030.
Under the Reference Case¬†2030, coal is expected to continue to play a significant
role in South Africa‚Äôs future energy mix either by direct use, for liquid fuels or
coal-based electricity generation. Electricity also continues to contribute
significantly.
Key insight:Table 5.1 shows the overall energy and electricity 
used to heat water in the residential and commercial 
sectors along with the energy and electricity used 
for water and process heating in the industrial sector 
in 2015 and under Reference Case¬†2030. As shown, 
the share of energy for water heating in the 
commercial sector was 21% in 2015, with water 
heating estimated to be responsible for 3.7% of 
electricity consumption in this sector. In the industrial 
sector, the share of water heating is estimated to be 
0.5% of the sector‚Äôs TFEC in 2015. Under the 
Reference Case 2030, the TFEC in industry and 
commercial sector is expected to grow between 
2015 and 2030. In the residential sector, overall TFEC 
is expected to decrease, while electricity use 
increases (mainly due to displacement of biomass 
with electricity and other fuels supplying energy 
services at higher efficiencies).
As outlined in Chapter 4, the DoE has drafted a post2015 NEES with targets for energy-use reductions to 
2030. The draft strategy is undergoing public 
consultation. The Reference Case 2030 does not 
account for the targets of the draft post-2015 NEES. 
Rather, the 2030 targets of the draft strategy are 
accounted for in the REmap Case 2030 (see Chapter 7). 
5.2 Developments in power 
generation and capacity
New generation capacity under the draft 
IRP 2016
The electricity sector outcomes for the Reference 
Case¬†2030 are based on the draft IRP 2016 update, as 
reflected in the draft IEP 2016 Base Case¬†(DoE, 2016a). 
The projections for installed capacity and energy mix 
from the draft IRP 2016 update are shown in¬†Figure¬†5.5. 
There is a notable difference in the electrical energy 
demand forecast between the IRP¬† 2010‚Äì2030 
promulgated in 2010 and forecasts based on more 
recent analysis for the draft IRP 2016 update. 
Namely, in the 2016 version, demand growth is 
expected to be much lower due to increased energy 
efficiency and lower future economic growth. 
In addition, as a result of considerable cost reductions 
and cost certainty associated with renewable energy 
technologies (in particular, solar PV and wind), there 
is an increased expected future role for these 
technologies. In the Reference Case 2030, solar PV 
and wind are projected to account for a total share of 
16% and 11%, respectively, in the electricity sector by 
2030, while coal is expected to continue to meet the 
majority of electricity demand (57%). Furthermore, in 
contrast to the promulgated IRP¬†2010‚Äì2030, there is 
no new-build coal or nuclear capacity under the draft 
IRP 2016 update.

Note: Installed capacities are based on assumed typical capacity factors as preliminary data are not available.
Based on DoE (2016a) and Wright et al. (2017a)
Under the Reference Case 2030, the installed capacity increases to 98.1¬†GW,
with growth especially in solar PV, natural gas, wind and hydro capacity. The
generation in the 2030 mix is still largely dominated by coal but features a
renewables‚Äô share of 37%.
Key insight:Box¬†4: Draft IRP 2018 update
The objective of the draft IRP 2018 update is to develop a sustainable electricity investment strategy for generation 
capacity and supporting infrastructure for South Africa. The modelling period for the draft IRP 2018 update 
extends to 2050, while the main time horizon is to 2030. 
The actual net electrical energy sent-out for South Africa declined at an average compound rate of minus 0.6% over 
the past years. That was in stark contrast to the expectation of an average growth rate of 3.0% in the IRP 
2010‚Äì‚Ää2030. The result was that the actual net sent-out in 2016 was 244 TWh, in comparison with the 296 TWh 
expected in the IRP 2010‚Äì2030 (i.e. an 18% difference).
Due to the unexpectedly fast cost reductions for generation from solar PV and onshore wind and to the 
successful deployment of renewable energy technologies under the first rounds of the REIPPPP, 
renewables play an earlier and elevated role in the power mix projected in the draft IRP 2018 update, as 
compared to IRP 2010‚Äì2030 and to draft IRP 2016 update. Specifically, due to the sharp cost reductions, 
the new-build capacity in the least-cost supply scenario to 2050 (i.e. unconstrained; including, without 
renewable energy annual build limits) of the draft IRP 2018 update only contains solar PV, wind and gas (as 
a proxy for system adequacy and flexibility). 
Table 5.2 shows the least-cost capacity development plan for the period up to 2030 with annual build 
limits (1 000 MW for solar PV, 1 600 MW for wind), from the draft IRP 2018 update. The annual build limits 
provide for smooth roll-out of renewables capacity, which can help better sustain the national industry. 
The capacity development plan of the draft 2018 IRP update also includes 1 000 MW of new additional 
coal-to-power capacity in 2023‚Äì2024, based on two already procured and announced projects. Further, it 
features inclusion of 2 500 MW of hydropower in 2030 to facilitate the RSA-DRC treaty on the Inga Hydro 
Power Project in line with South Africa‚Äôs commitments contained in the National Development Plan to 
partner with regional neighbours. It also includes annual allocations of 200¬†MW for generation-for-own-use 
between 1 MW to 10 MW, starting in 2018.
The degree of ambition for renewable energy deployment has gradually increased, starting from the IRP 2010‚Äì2030 
and continuing with the draft IRP 2016 update and the draft IRP 2018 update. At the same time, the ambition to 
decommission existing ageing coal capacity has also increased. The draft IRP 2018 update expects a 
decommissioning of coal of 12.0 GW by 2030 and of a total of 33.8 GW by 2050. Close to 75% of the current Eskom 
coal fleet would have reached end-of-life status by 2040. Under this schedule, coal is expected to contribute less 
than 30% of the energy supplied by 2040 and less than 20% by 2050. Figure¬† 5.6 shows the schedule for the 
decommissioning of coal capacity under the draft IRP 2018 update. Table 5.2: New generation build plan under the draft 2018 IRP

Chapter 3 presented the overall status of national 
electrification. While considerable progress has been 
achieved in recent years, considerable further effort is 
still required to achieve universal electrification in 
South Africa by 2030, as established in the New 
Household Electrification Strategy (NHES) that was 
adopted by the cabinet in 2013 (see DoE [2013b] for 
further information about the NHES and its 
objectives). The Reference¬†Case¬†2030 is aligned with 
the target for universal access25 by 2030. 
25 As full electrification is unlikely to be feasible due to growth 
and delays in the process of formalising informal settlements, 
the national cabinet in 2013 approved the defining of universal 
access as 97% of households (DoE, 2013b). The NHES defined 
a goal for universal access by 2025, while the National 
Dlt Pl2030 tthtt f2030
As outlined in Chapter 3, Section 4, this can be 
enhanced through the increased deployment of 
renewables.
The target of universal access by 2030 is defined in 
the National Development Plan¬† 2030¬† (NPC, 2011). 
For universal access, at least 90% of electrification is 
envisioned to be provided by on-grid access, with 
the remainder being provided by off-grid options 
including alternative energy options (not via 
electrification: e.g. liquefied petroleum gas, 
bioenergy) (DoE, 2013b). This target can be achieved 
through continued on-grid electrification efforts as 
discussed in Chapter¬† 3, combined with off-grid 
electrification and alternative energy options (where 
appropriate). Chapter 3, Section 3 presents national 
grid expansion plans, while this section focuses 
specifically on nongrid options

Based on DoE (2018b)
In addition to the decommissioning of coal capacity, 1 800 MW of nuclear power capacity will reach end-of-life 
status between 2044 and 2045. As indicated, the draft IRP 2018 update may yet be subject to change. However, 
its draft version provides a clear indication of direction.Although non-grid electrification is already a 
component of the INEP, there will need to be an 
increased focus on non-grid electrification going 
forward. More specifically, remote locations where 
deep rural on-grid electrification would be impractical 
or uneconomical in comparison to off-grid electrical 
connections will need to be considered along with 
alternative energy options. Suitable options for offgrid access include individual dwelling and household 
electrification via SHSs (as is currently the case) or 
alternative renewables technologies like distributed 
solar¬† PV, wind, biomass/biogasenabled digesters or 
the increased deployment of other alternatives like 
liquefied petroleum gas. 
Community-level and town-level micro-grids may be 
established on the basis of distributed renewable 
energy technologies.
These include modern biomass or biogas, microhydro, solar PV and/or wind combined with other 
flexible resources like diesel generation, energy 
storage and the necessary network infrastructure 
can enable reliable, affordable and sustainable 
electricity access. More than 7.4¬† million households 
have been connected to the grid and more than 
160 307 households were connected through nongrid technology between 1994 and March 2018. To 
reach the universal access targets, the DoE has 
analysed the potential for deployment of non-gridbased solutions. The NHES aims to provide 300 000 
households with quality non-grid solutions (including 
mini-grid/hybrid and biogas systems) by 2025, 
which is in line with the ambition to meet 10% of 
universal access with non-grid solutions (DoE, 
2013b). Figure¬† 5.7 below shows the estimated 
potential for deployment of such solutions in each 
province of South Africa up to 2025.

energy use in the Reference 
Case 2030
Figure¬† 5.8 shows the expected share of renewable 
energy sources in the power sector under the 
Reference¬† Case¬† 2030. The Reference Case¬† 2030 
suggests rising use of renewable power.
South Africa would thereby increase its renewable 
power generation from 9% in 2015 to 37% by 2030 
(including imported hydropower). The primary 
renewable energy carriers in the Reference Case 
2030 include solar PV (share of 16% in electricity 
generation), wind (11%) and hydro (9%), with a small 
role played by biomass/biogas (see also Figure¬†5.5).

to ‚âà13% of TFEC by 2030.
The main renewable energy technologies are solar PV 
and wind followed by hydro, whilst the role of biomass 
is reduced significantly (from 127 PJ in 2015 to 4 PJ 
by 2030). This is further elaborated in the next 
section.

by sector and technology mix
The TFEC by end-use sector and the renewables use 
across sectors under the Reference Case¬† 2030 are 
summarised in¬† Figure¬† 5.10 and Figure¬† 5.11, 
respectively. The shares of renewables by technology 
and end-use sector in 2015 and 2030 are compared 
in¬†Figure¬†5.12. Owing to the considerable deployment 
of renewables for power generation under the 
Reference¬† Case¬† 2030, especially from solar¬† PV and 
wind, the share of renewables is higher in those enduse sectors that use electricity as energy carrier. 
The significantly reduced role of traditional biomass 
in the residential sector (currently predominantly 
used for cooking and heating) results from a switch 
to the use of electricity, as universal energy access is 
reached in the Reference Case 2030. As can be seen 
in¬†Figure¬†5.11, a result of this is that residential TFEC 
actually decreases in absolute terms under the 
Reference¬† Case¬† 2030. The overall share of 
renewables in the residential sector also declines due 
to this switch to electricity, but the elevated role of 
modern renewable energy power generating 
technologies in the electricity sector means that 
renewables still play an important role (91 PJ, or 32% 
of residential TFEC by 2030).
The share of renewables in TFEC in the commercial 
sector is the highest of all end-use sectors under the 
Reference Case 2030. By 2030, the share of 
renewables is projected to grow to 32% of TFEC (from 
7% in 2015), as a result of electricity assuming the 
dominant role as energy carrier in the commercial 
sector (80% of TFEC in 2015 and 86% by 2030) as it 
replaces coal (predominantly for space heating).
In the industrial sector, TFEC increases under the 
Reference¬† Case 2030 as can be seen in¬† Figure¬† 5.11. 
The industrial sector continues to use coal, liquid fuels 
and natural gas, though predominantly for industrial 
process heat and transportation requirements. The 
role of renewables in the industrial sector increases 
from just above 5% in 2015 (42 PJ) to 18% (206 PJ) by 
2030 under the Reference Case. 
In the transport sector, the limited deployment of 
electricity (9 PJ by 2030), natural gas or hydrogenbased transportation for freight and passenger 
road, rail and/or air transportation in the 
Reference¬† Case¬† 2030 (i.e. the draft IEP 2016 Base 
Case) is primarily a result of the following:
‚óè No further cost reductions for electric vehicles are 
assumed in the time horizon to 2030.
‚óè Upfront electric vehicles‚Äô penetration constraints 
of 0.3% (2020), 0.8% (2025) and 1.5% (2030) as 
share of the total vehicle fleet.
‚óè Improved internal combustion engine¬† (ICE) fuel 
efficiency.
‚óè No significant mode shifting between road and rail 
transportation.
‚óè No expected significant increase in natural gas 
and/or hydrogen-based transportation.
This results in a continued dominance of liquid fuels in 
the transport sector to 2030 (99% of TFEC). The 
limited electricity end-use (predominantly in rail and 
small electric vehicle deployment) makes up the 
remainder of TFEC in transportation. As a result of 
this, the share of renewable energy changes only 
slightly under the Reference Case, from near-zero in 
2015 to just under 1% by 2030.In the agricultural sector, the share of modern 
renewables is expected to increase from ‚âà3% in 2015 to 
‚âà13% by 2030 under the Reference¬†Case. This is primarily 
a result of energy carriers in agriculture.
It remains largely unchanged in the Reference¬† Case¬†
2030 (i.e. there remains an even split between 
electricity and diesel), and because renewables assume 
a much-increased role in the electricity mix.

Under the Reference Case 2030, there is a considerable increase in the use
of renewables for power generation (especially from solar¬†PV and wind

of renewables is expected to almost double, and to particularly increase in
industry and commerce.
Key insight:6 RENEWABLE ENERGY POTENTIAL AND 
(FUTURE) COSTS IN SOUTH AFRICA
KEY POINTS
‚óè South Africa has abundant solar irradiation and 
wind resources. The resources are distributed 
across virtually the entire territory. South Africa also 
has significant potential for further bioenergy 
deployment (from different resources) and some 
limited specific sites that are well-suited for smallsize and medium-size hydropower generation.
‚óè Over recent years, renewables options have 
become substantially cheaper for electricity 
generation compared to other new-build options in 
South Africa such as nuclear and coal. In addition to 
the reductions in renewable energy technology 
costs, this is partly a result of the REIPPPP 
competitive bidding process.
‚óè Successful bid tariffs achieved in the latest bid 
windows of the REIPPPP averaged USD¬†0.046/kWh 
for both wind-based and solar PV-based electricity. 
The downward cost trends for solar PV and wind 
generation technologies are expected to continue 
for the coming years. 
‚óè CSP and bioenergy applications under the 
REIPPPP came in at USD 0.149/kWh and 
USD¬† 0.082‚Äì0.119/kWh, respectively. Baseload 
coal prices under the Coal IPP Programme 
averaged USD 0.074/kWh. The price estimate 
for nuclear power is USD 0.081/kWh. Solar¬†PV 
and wind are overall the cheapest new-build 
generation options in South Africa, although 
additional system-related costs may result from 
integration of higher shares of variable 
renewables (i.e. solar PV, wind).
‚óè Although further cost reductions in some 
technologies are assumed in the draft IRP 2016 
update for the medium term, no further 
considerable cost reductions are expected in 
any technology options from 2030 onwards.
‚óè The assessment of resource potential and 
expected cost trends provides a key input to the 
identification of technology deployment options 
(see Chapter 7).
6.1 Theoretical and technological 
potential of renewables by 
resource
The projection of renewable energy technology 
deployment requires a robust understanding of the 
scale and potential of available resources. This section 
outlines the renewable energy resource endowment 
of South Africa and the resource distribution over the 
territory of the country. The most abundant renewable 
resources are solar, wind and biomass (mostly plant 
residues and organic waste); also, some specific sites 
are well-suited for hydropower generation at both 
medium and small scale. 
As explained in Chapter 3, Section 3 of this study, 
South Africa‚Äôs national government, through its 
Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA), 
approved so-called renewable energy development 
zones (REDZs) where generation projects may be 
developed with minimal risk of disturbing the 
environment. Outside of these zones, projects may 
only be developed if respective approvals can be 
obtained from the relevant authorities. Figure¬† 6.1 
below shows the location of the REDZs and of 
proposed solar PV and wind power projects in South 
Africa for which EIAs have been submitted to the 
DEA (as of Q2 2018). The map shows that the eight 
REDZs are distributed widely over the land area of 
South Africa. The location of the REDZs (as also 
presented in Figure¬† 3.9 above) appears to not be a 
constraint to the development of renewable energy Table 6.1 shows the theoretical resource potential for 
all REDZs in terms of capacity and generation, as well 
as the solar PV and wind generation capacity 
proposed by project developers.

Note: The assumed power densities are wind = 5‚Äì8 MW/km¬≤ and solar PV = 20‚Äì30 MW/km¬≤.
Based on CSIR, Fraunhofer IWES et al. (2016)In total there are eight¬†areas marked as REDZs, with a 
theoretical potential to host a total of over 
‚âà1 300‚Äì‚Ää2 000 GW of solar PV and onshore wind 
generation combined. The total area of all REDZs is 
approximately 78 000 km¬≤, and 53 472 km¬≤ after the 
exclusion of environmentally sensitive areas, bird 
migration paths, rivers, built infrastructure such as 
roads, human settlements, etc. This is about 6.5% of 
South Africa‚Äôs land area (4.5% after exclusions). 
In addition to the REDZs, South Africa participated in 
the Multi-criteria Analysis for Planning Renewable 
Energy (MapRE) study conducted by IRENA and 
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 2015 
(Wu et al., 2015). The study identified zones for costeffective, equitable and environmentally sustainable 
wind, solar PV and CSP deployment in the countries 
of the Eastern and Southern African power pools. The 
analysis applied a multi-criteria framework to come up 
with a cumulative score for determining the suitability 
of land areas in the order of 100 km¬≤ (‚Äúzones‚Äù) for 
solar PV, CSP and wind deployment. 
Criteria included the LCOE of power generation, 
capacity value, distance to load centres, distance to 
grid, and population density, among others. The 
analysis resulted in inventories of possible highpotential zones for wind and solar projects; the 
database is available via the MapRE website.26
The map below shows the renewable energy zones 
for South Africa identified in the MapRE analysis as 
well as the existing and proposed relevant 
infrastructure. The map also indicates the REDZs for 
South Africa (see purple crossed areas); the zones 
identified in the MapRE analysis and the REDZs 
determined by the DEA are widely convergent with 
regard to those areas that are identified as suitable for 
solar PV and wind projects. The MapRE analysis 
identifies a larger overall area and consequently a 
larger overall theoretical capacity and generation 
potential. The factors considered as developmental 
constraints for renewable energy projects are not 
shown in the map but accounted for in the zone 
identification.

estimates due to some difference in assumptions.
The following sections provide further detail on 
renewable resource potential in South Africa.
Solar irradiation
CSP technology requires direct irradiation, as it 
converts concentrated irradiation to heat to drive an 
engine connected to an electrical power generator. 
The average annual direct normal irradiation (DNI) for 
South Africa is shown geographically in¬† Figure¬† 6.3. 
The DNI in South Africa is among the highest in the 
world (other top locations include Australia, Chile, and 
most of the Middle-East North Africa region). The DNI 
is particularly high in the Northern Cape Province 
of South Africa, with large areas exhibiting annual 
irradiation levels of up to 3 000 kWh per square metre 
(m¬≤) per year. 
Consequently, existing and planned CSP capacity 
projects are located in the Northern Cape Province. 
The map in Figure 6.3 shows that even the central 
areas of South Africa feature DNI levels of 
approximately 2 500 kWh/m¬≤/year. Such DNI levels 
are comparable to regions in Europe that have hosted 
CSP projects, such as the Helios and Manchasol 
50 MW CSP plants located in Spain, where DNI levels 
are 2 200‚Äì2 500 kWh/m¬≤/year. 
Besides the DNI level, the suitability of areas for CSP 
deployment is also affected by geotechnical attributes 
of the land area (i.e. how stable the ground is for the 
construction of heavy infrastructure such as the 
power block of a thermal generation plant); the 
availability of water for cleaning panels, heliostats or 
parabolic troughs; as well as good road infrastructure 
for delivery of project components. Proximity to grid 
infrastructure is also an important factor in South 
Africa given that, under the REIPPPP, project 
developers must bear the costs for connection to the 
national grid.

The global horizontal irradiation¬† (GHI) serves as 
indication of the relative resource for solar¬† PV 
applications. Figure¬† 6.4 shows the GHI levels across 
the land areas of South Africa. The entire territory of 
South Africa has GHI levels higher than 
1 300 kWh/m¬≤/year, which indicates the theoretical 
suitability of virtually any location in South Africa for 
solar PV deployment. 
The wide distribution of GHI in South Africa is 
important to support high grid penetration of solar PV 
since project sites can be spread across the country to 
avoid grid congestion and to ease VRE integration. 
The geographical flexibility in choosing project sites is 
also important from a socio-economic standpoint, as 
plants can be located in areas where they contribute 
to a just transition in the energy sector (see chapters 7 
and 9 for further information).

South Africa hosts some of the best sites in the world in terms of DNI. The
Northern Cape Province, which has the highest such irradiation levels, hosts all
CSP plants being planned and constructed in South Africa so far.
Key insight:As part of a study by CSIR, Fraunhofer IWES, 
SANEDI and Eskom from 2016, significant solar PV 
potential was found from a few pre-selected areas 
in South Africa, including urban settlement areas 
for rooftop solar¬† PV (amounting to 1.2% of total 
land area) with total solar PV installation capacity 
potential of approximately 72 GW (generating 
136 TWh). 
Sites for which EIA applications to the DEA have 
been made as of 2016 are equal to 0.8% of total 
land area, with 197‚Äì‚Ää296 GW in potential installed 
capacity (see Table 6.1), generating around 
420 TWh.

South Africa has excellent solar GHI resources across virtually the entire area of
the country. Solar PV projects, therefore, can be expanded, located away from
areas of grid congestion and strategically placed close to major load centres.

Onshore wind 
Figure¬† 6.5 shows an image from the Wind Atlas 
of South Africa (WASA), developed jointly by the 
DoE, CSIR, SANEDI, South African Weather Service 
(SAWS), the Technical University of Denmark Wind 
Energy Group, and University of Cape Town (UCT). 
Figure¬† 6.5 shows that the South African wind 
resource is well dispersed geographically even 
outside of coastal areas, which were previously 
thought to be the only areas suitable for the 
development of wind projects. 
Vast areas of the Northern Cape are also suitable for 
wind power, and this has been reflected in the 
numerous wind projects approved in this province 
under the REIPPPP. The model time series data that 
were utilised to create the Wind Atlas show that 
average wind speeds are seldom below 5 meters/
second at 100 m above ground level in most of South 
Africa‚Äôs area.
Further evidence of South Africa‚Äôs substantial wind 
resource may be found in the average capacity 
factors that can be calculated using the underlying 
data from the Wind Atlas of South Africa. As shown 
in Figure¬† 6.6, around 75% of the land area 
(conservatively estimated) exhibits wind load 
factors27 above 0.3, while 50% of the land area even 
exhibits load factors above 0.35. This is significant 
because wind energy projects generally require 
capacity factor levels of 0.25 or above to be 
economically viable. 
27 Note that the ‚Äúwind load factor‚Äù is the same as the capacity 
factor. It is the average power generated divided by the rated 
peak power. For example, if a 10 MW wind turbine produces 
power at an average of 4 MW, then its capacity factor/load 
factor is 40%.

In addition, according to the solar PV and wind 
aggregation study conducted by CSIR, Fraunhofer 
IWES and others (2016), there is sufficient land in 
South Africa to accommodate a level of generation 
potential from onshore wind that matches the 
current size of the entire South African power 
system from the perspective of installed capacity. 
This effectively signifies an unlimited wind resource 
potential, to the degree that it can be integrated 
into the power system with sufficient flexibility.
Bioenergy
In South Africa, bioenergy has historically been used 
directly in the residential sector for heating and 
cooking, as well as industrial processes, on-site power 
generation and, more recently, utility-scale power 
generation (under the REIPPPP)
The primary energy supply from traditional biomass 
totalled approximately 127 PJ in 2015 (see Chapter 3), 
all for residential end-use. Under the Reference Case, 
the use of traditional biomass is reduced to 4 PJ by 
2030. The use of biomass in the future would likely be 
for either biofuels or power generation. South Africa 
plans for 345 MW of generation capacity from 
bioenergy to be deployed by 2030 through current 
allocations under the REIPPPP, including biomass 
(210 MW) and biogas/landfill gas¬† (135 MW)¬† (DoE, 
DNT and DBSA, 2018a). So far, 41 MW of biomass 
and 18 MW of landfill gas have been procured for 
power generation.
The Bioenergy Atlas for South Africa, published in 
2016¬† (Hugo, 2016), noted significant potential for 
further bioenergy deployment. The potential is 
constrainedprimarily due to prioritisation of food

productivity and inter-annual weather variability.
The Bioenergy Atlas found that an additional 
487 PJ/‚Ääyear of biomass (‚âà350 PJ/year if purposefully 
cultivated crops are excluded for food security 
reasons) is currently available for energy use in South 
Africa. Specifically, the Bioenergy Atlas resulted in the 
following set of options for biomass utilisation:
‚óè Utilisation of all available urban domestic 
(household) organic waste, from solid waste and 
from wastewater, is the most feasible option, with 
an acceptable end-product cost. Some local 
authorities may choose to use wastewater biogas 
for in-situ electricity generation. The estimated 
contribution from feasible project options is up to 
1 400 MW.
‚óè The development of household or communal 
digesters in rural (unserved) areas in combination 
with cattle dung in areas where this is available. 
The estimated contribution from feasible project 
options is up to 250 MW.
‚óè The combination of all available lignocellulose 
biomass (invasive alien plants, plantation residues, 
sugar mill bagasse and agricultural residue) can 
make a significant contribution to electricity 
generation in mid-size regional power stations 
(typical size of 50‚Äì300 MW). Projects may have a 
limited lifetime due to the objective of eradication 
of invasive alien plants over a 20-year period. 
Some of the project options are in areas of poor 
electricity availability (rural Mpumalanga, Eastern 
Cape, KwaZulu-Natal) and will be able to underpin 
rural electrification projects. The costs are 
comparable to new electricity from coal. The 
estimated contribution from feasible project 
options is up to 1 300 MW.
South Africa has significant (while constrained) potential for bioenergy,
of 487 PJ/yr.

Source: Hugo (2016)Table 6.3 outlines the identified biomass energy 
potential in South Africa in further detail, in terms of 
the mass potential and actual available mass and the 
energy equivalent (in PJ/year), by energy carrier. 
As shown in Table 6.3, according to the Bioenergy
Atlas for South Africa (Hugo, 2016), an additional 
90 PJ/yr in bioenergy is nationally available from a 
combination of sawmill waste (including bark), 
organic solid waste, and organic sewage sludge. 
Small-scale bio-digesters in rural communities could 
contribute a further 250 MW (0.5‚Äì1.0 TWh/yr). The 
potential for using invasive alien species, agricultural 
waste and plant residues amounts to over 200 PJ/yr 
and could allow for 11‚Äì19 TWh/yr in medium-sized 
power generation facilities distributed across the 
country. The use of purposefully cultivated crops for 
biodiesel has the potential to supply 570¬†million litres/
yr (around 5% of current diesel fuel demand in South 
Africa) (Hugo, 2016). 
Figure¬† 6.7 shows the potential project locations for 
biodiesel, biogas and electricity generation from 
bioenergy, as identified in the Bioenergy Atlas. The 
most suitable project options are associated with the 
major metropolitan areas of the country, which 
include Gauteng, Nelson¬† Mandela Bay, Cape Town 
and surrounds, eThekwini, and Buffalo City. These 
areas allow for significant economies of scale to be 
realised, with facilities that remain viable even with 
transport costs for distances of up to 150¬†km from the 
biomass feedstock to the bio-digester.

alternative markets in energy for the local sugar cane 
industry, and modern cooking fuels such as biochar 
and dried wood pellets from woody biomass.
Hydropower 
Medium-scale and small-scale hydropower presents 
an additional renewable energy option for South 
Africa. Figure¬† 6.8 provides a map of high water 
yield areas where hydropower sites may be found. 
It shows that the south-eastern coastal areas of 
South Africa are the most viable for investigating the 
feasibility of hydropower projects, from micro-scale 
to small-scale. The map is based on a collaborative 
project between CSIR, WWF, United Nations 
Environment Programme and Global Environment 
Facility (2013). In recent years, South Africa has 
experienced lower rainfall, and the issue of water 
scarcity is increasingly becoming a high priority for 
policy makers. This limits the potential for 
hydropower. At present, Eskom has approximately 
3.4¬†GW of installed hydropower¬†‚Äì¬†over half of which 
is pumped storage hydropower.

Key insight:6.2 Costs of renewable power 
currently, in 2030 and beyond
How much of the theoretical resource potential 
identified in Chapter 6, Section 1 will ultimately be 
harnessed will largely depend, besides the applicable 
technological and infrastructure limitations, on the 
costs related to different technology options. The 
South African power sector has seen ever-increasing 
prices over the last decade and this trend is expected 
to continue over the decade to come as older, fully 
amortised generation units are decommissioned and 
new plants are constructed. 
Of the new-build options, deployment costs for 
renewable energy technologies, such as wind and 
solar PV, continue to be in decline. This section 
explores the cost comparison of different power 
generation options in South Africa, currently and 
into the future, based on a range of cost parameters.
Capital/overnight and fixed costs
Table 6.4 gives an overview of the capital/overnight 
and fixed costs of all electricity generation options in 
South Africa, based on cost data from the draft IRP 
2016 update (DoE and EPRI, 2015). Capital costs are 
one-time expenses incurred on the purchase of land, 
buildings, construction and equipment used for the 
generation of electricity¬†‚Äì¬†they indicate the total cost 
for bringing a project to a commercially operable 
status. For renewable energy projects, the bulk of 
total costs is capital cost (and virtually no expenses 
for fuel inputs are incurred). 
For this reason, renewable energy projects are typically 
linked to a long-term PPA where the once-off upfront 
capital costs can be amortised over a long period using 
the proceeds from the electricity generated. A fixed 
cost is an expense for operations and maintenance that 
does not change with an increase or decrease in the 
amount of electricity generated or sold. Fixed costs 
have to be paid regardless of or independently from 
any business activity.

South Africa and global cost figures (e.g. see IRENA 
Renewable Cost Database for global cost figures). 
This difference can be due to how disparate 
jurisdictions exhibit different input costs such as 
labour, supporting services etc; these would affect 
the fixed operations and maintenance costs. Capital 
costs may vary due to conditions on the sale of the 
capital equipment in different jurisdictions.
Current levelised cost of electricity 
(LCOE)
The LCOE, essentially the tariffs achieved through 
procurement programmes, provides a comprehensive 
metric for comparing the costs of different technology 
options, going beyond capital and fixed costs. The 
LCOE is defined as the net present-day monetary cost 
per kWh unit of electricity delivered, which, when 
adjusted for inflation each year over the lifetime of the 
plant, will recover its full costs. This metric includes 
the initial investment cost, cost of finance (including 
dividends and interest), fuel costs and all other fixed 
and variable operation and maintenance costs. LCOE 
does not account for grid integration costs and the 
specific value or role that each technology plays in the 
overall performance and functioning of the power 
system. 
In light of this, LCOE may be used to assess trends on 
how the costs of certain technologies are increasing 
or decreasing ‚Äì thereby pointing out which 
technologies are likely to feature more prominently in 
a national energy plan. An all-encompassing cost 
comparison across technologies should, however, 
include a detailed power system analysis to account 
for integration costs and the operation of the power 
system as a whole.
The cost levels that have been realised since 2011 
from the competitive bidding process for utility-scale 
renewable energy deployment (i.e. REIPPPP) are 
summarised in¬† Figure¬† 6.9. A significant decrease in 
costs is notable for solar PV (reductions of over 80% 
since 2011), onshore wind (around 60% cost 
reductions) and CSP (45% cost reductions). Successful 
bid tariffs achieved in the 2015 expedited Bid 
Window 4 of the REIPPPP were below USD¬†0.05/kWh 
for electricity generation from both wind and solar 
PV. CSP and bioenergy (not shown in Figure¬† 6.9) 
applications have reached average prices of 
around USD¬† 0.15/kWh and USD 0.082‚Äì0.122/kWh, 
respectively, under the REIPPPP. The general cost 
levels for biogas are estimated at around 
USD¬† 0.1-0.15/kWh, for electricity from lignocellulose 
at around USD¬† 0.15‚Äì0.2/kWh, and for biofuels at 
around USD¬†0.2/kWh (Hugo, 2018).

tariffs for solar and wind technologies are compared 
to those for conventional technologies. For example, 
baseload coal prices under the prospective coal IPP 
programme averaged about USD¬† 0.074/kWh, thus 
almost 40% higher than solar PV and wind. All other 
costs shown in¬†Figure¬†6.9 for new-build options reflect 
cost estimates used in the IRP update. 
These are based on developments in other markets 
rather than on actual competitive bid outcomes in 
South Africa. Gas and diesel open cycle turbines are 
the most expensive options in terms of LCOE, due to 
their low capacity factors and high fuel costs ‚Äì both 
options have an LCOE above USD¬†0.2/kWh (at around 
10% capacity factor).

The trend lines show the considerable cost reductions for solar PV, wind
and CSP realised since 2011 as part of the REIPPPP and the increasing
cost-competitiveness of renewable energy options compared to conventional
technologies.
Key insight:Future LCOE, to 2030 and beyond
Forward-looking cost trends for energy technology 
deployment can vary since the trajectory depends 
on various assumptions and on having a stable 
policy environment and a consistent procurement 
programme over the long term. The naturally 
resulting divergence in projections, both for South 
Africa and globally, is illustrated in this section, with 
reference to DoE, IRENA and BNEF cost projections 
for different generation options from renewable 
resources.
The view from the South African DoE with regard to 
applicable technology learning rates and cost 
projections is found in the national IRP. The learning 
rate is the percentage cost reduction experienced for 
every doubling of cumulative installed capacity; it is 
therefore an expression of how costs decline as a 
technology is increasingly deployed. Higher learning 
rates imply faster cost reductions for a given rate of 
technology deployment. In the IRP 2010‚Äì2030 and 
the draft IRP 2016 update, very modest learning rates 
are assumed for wind and bioenergy technologies. 
Only marginal further cost reductions are therefore 
assumed to materialise going forward.
The draft IRP 2016 update considers a higher cost 
assumption for solar PV for 2015 (based on REIPPPP 
Bid Window 3 at USD¬† 0.067‚Äì0.097/kWh) than cost 
levels reached under REIPPPP Bid Window 4. A 
projection that follows the trajectory of the draft IRP 
2016 update, using Bid Window 3 as the baseline, 
reaches costs of USD¬†0.05‚Äì0.075/kWh by 2030; while 
taking Bid Window 4 as a starting point into the future 
results in solar PV costs of USD¬†0.043/kWh by 2030 
(Wright et al., 2017a; see also Figure¬†6.11 below). The 
most recent bid windows of the REIPPPP exhibited 
LCOE levels that, according to assumptions in the 
draft IRP 2016 update, had been assumed to only 
materialise in 2030 (CSIR, 2016). 
In other words, learning rates for renewable energy in 
South Africa have exceeded expectations, and the 
LCOE levels are decreasing at a higher rate than 
previously expected. The higher-than-expected 
decrease in LCOE for solar PV is a result of two main 
drivers. Firstly, manufacturing costs globally are 
decreasing rapidly as economies of scale are achieved, 
and this benefit filters down into the South African 
market. Secondly, the REIPPPP has engendered 
strong competition among bidders, particularly in the 
most recent bid windows, hence driving LCOE costs 
down even further. In South Africa, the costs for solar 
PV and CSP are expected to further decrease 
significantly to 2030, while the costs for onshore wind 
are expected to decrease more moderately. At the 
global level, costs are expected to decrease 
substantively for solar PV and onshore wind to 2020 
and further to 2030. Table 6.5 provides an overview of 
LCOE of selected renewable energy technologies in 
South Africa and at the global level, showing the 
expected costs to 2030 relative to current cost levels 
in South Africa.Figure¬†6.10 illustrates in more detail the IRENA analysis 
on the global average LCOE reduction potential of windbased and solar-based technologies up to 2020. 
According to the analysis, the largest reduction potential 
lies with solar PV and CSP, with LCOE figures of 
USD¬†0.06/kWh and around USD 0.08/kWh, respectively, 
by 2020. 
Onshore wind shows an LCOE Figure of USD¬†0.05/‚ÄäkWh 
by 2020. The cost projections for all VRE technologies 
for 2020 fall within the expected cost range from fossil 
fuels (marked in green).

Based on DoE (2016f); DoE and EPRI (2015); Wright et al. (2017a); IRENA (2018c); IRENA (2016); BNEF (2018)¬†As shown in Figure¬†6.11, the draft IRP 2016 update 
assumes no further cost reductions for any 
technology options after 2030, indicating an 
assumption that technologies will have reached 
maturity and no further cost reductions will be 
achieved with additional manufacturing economies 
of scale. The ‚Äúhigh‚Äù and ‚Äúlow‚Äù cost trajectories 
outlined in the IRP¬† 2010‚Äì2030 and draft¬† IRP¬† 2016 
update (see Figure¬† 6.11) refer to the range of 
resource potential available. For example, solar PV 
profiles are divided into 27 regions with varying 
levels of resource availability. The ‚Äúhigh‚Äù cost 
trajectory represents areas that have low resources 
(such as regions around Gauteng) while the ‚Äúlow‚Äù 
costs represent regions predominantly in the 
Northern Cape. 
Figure¬† 6.11 shows that upper-bound costs for solar 
PV expected only by 2030 have already been 
reached through competitive bidding under the 
REIPPPP.
The estimates for South Africa can generally be seen 
as rather conservative when compared to global 
trends. Costs of USD¬† 0.02/kWh have already been 
achieved for solar PV in other regions of the world 
with comparable solar irradiation.28 While a 
comparison between countries in terms of PPA prices 
cannot be perfectly aligned due to inter alia
differences in the cost of capital and plant sizes, it 
does provide an indicative understanding of what is 
achievable in terms of technology-specific costs.
28 For example, solar PV projects in Dubai have reached price 
levels as low as USD 0.02/kWh with an average GHI resource of 
2 021 kWh/m¬≤/year (with many areas in South Africa exhibiting 
similar GHI levels).

Cost levels under the REIPPPP have already
undercut cost projections under both the
IRP 2010‚Äì2030 and the draft IRP 2016
update. Solar PV has already reached
levels of USD¬†0.05/‚ÄäkWh in 2015, while the
IRP forecasted that these levels would not
Key insight:For CSP, the cost projections are also based on the 
expedited fourth bid window of the REIPPPP. Applying 
learning rates found in the IRP shows a decrease in the 
cost of CSP to USD¬† 0.092/kWh by 2030. This can 
be regarded as a conservative estimate, as CSP 
projects globally have already seen prices as low as 
USD¬†0.06/‚ÄäkWh for plants commissioning in 2020 (The 
National [UAE edition], 2017). 
For a complete picture, total system costs for power 
supply have to be considered when making 
comparisons between technologies, and the impact of 
different generation technologies on the operation of 
the power system should be accounted for when 
assessing the potential that each technology offers. 
Fluctuating supplies from weather-dependent 
renewable sources (solar, wind) can cause grid stability 
challenges as they require balancing or flexibility 
measures (see Chapter¬†3, Section¬†2 for an overview of 
flexibility options). Accounting for potential additional 
integration costs for VREs could therefore make for a 
more objective comparison against conventional power 
supply technologies. 
Since this study does not include a detailed network 
analysis, its scope does not extend to assessing and 
quantifying grid integration costs. 
Commodity prices
Figure¬† 6.12 provides an overview of expected costs 
for key energy commodities (namely, refined 
petroleum products) to 2030 and 2050, taken from 
the macroeconomic assumptions of the draft IEP 2016 
(DoE, 2016f). The figure¬†shows that, in line with crude 
oil price projections, the costs for all the energy 
carriers are expected to significantly increase between 
2015 and 2050, pointing to a need to increasingly 
deploy alternative end-use options, including 
renewables. Coal technology prices (pulverised coal 
and fluidised bed combustion coal) are also expected 
to increase significantly. The commodity price 
projections are quoted in South African rand (ZAR). 
Figure¬†6.12 does not account for future assumptions 
on how the national currency will perform against 
foreign currencies in which such commodities are 
commonly quoted. Yet, the trend of steadily 
increasing commodity prices is apparent.

SOUTH AFRICA
KEY POINTS
‚óè The REmap Case 2030 represents renewable 
energy technology options (‚ÄúREmap Options‚Äù) 
beyond the Reference Case 2030 that are 
considered feasible and realistic in terms of both 
resource potential and technology deployment 
speed. 
‚óè Total final energy consumption (TFEC) under the 
REmap Case 2030 is expected to increase from 
2 290 PJ in 2015 to 2 493 PJ by 2030 (after 
energy efficiency savings of 363 PJ). The analysis 
identifies REmap Options that could increase 
renewable energy use in South Africa to 568 PJ 
by 2030 (23% of TFEC). This is a considerable 
increase compared to the Reference Case, which 
expects 13% of TFEC to be based on renewable 
energy by 2030 (366 PJ).
‚óè REmap Options in the power sector could allow 
for the total share of renewables in electricity 
production to increase from ‚âà9% in 2015 to 49% 
by 2030 (compared to the Reference¬† Case¬† with 
37% by 2030). 
‚óè Power generation technologies identified to 
contribute to the renewable energy share as part 
of the REmap Options for 2030 are onshore wind 
(21% of electrical energy), utility-scale solar¬† PV 
(14%), distributed solar PV (on-grid/off-grid; 2%), 
CSP (1%), biomass/biogas (4%) and hydro (7%; 
mostly imported).
‚óè Under the REmap Case 2030, coal plays a lesser 
while still significant role in the energy sector by 
2030 (either by direct end-use, for liquid fuel 
production or coal-based electricity generation). 
‚óè In addition to the considerable deployment of 
renewable energy technologies in the electricity 
sector, identified REmap technology options in 
end-use sectors are dominated by solar thermal 
(10% of end-use by 2030 in buildings) and 
modern bioenergy (6% of industrial end-use by 
2030) for heating, cooling and cooking. 
‚óè Although traditional biomass (predominantly in 
the residential sector) is almost completely 
removed by 2030, modern forms of biomass 
and enabling technologies are identified for 
various end-use sectors, including foremost the 
residential sector. Increased use of biomass for 
power generation and the blending of biofuels 
for transportation are two REmap Options 
identified for 2030.
‚óè Although transportation is identified as a sector 
that could shift to alternative energy carriers, 
fossil-based liquid fuels in the form of petrol and 
diesel still dominate in the REmap Case 2030 
(93% of transport end-use by 2030). REmap 
Options in the transport sector are the use of 
electricity (2% of transport end-use by 2030), 
renewables-based hydrogen (1% of transport 
end-use by 2030), biodiesel and bio-ethanol 
blending (4% of transport end-use by 2030).
‚óè Potential for energy efficiency improvements is 
identified in the residential sector (20 PJ) with 
appliances and lighting as well as absolute 
reductions in commercial/public building energy 
consumption (17 PJ). Industrial energy efficiency 
could be achieved through improving the 
efficiency of technologies supplying end-use 
services in manufacturing and mining (estimated 
potential of 186 PJ). Significant potential 
improvements in transport sector energy 
efficiency are also identified (140 PJ), namely 
from increased vehicle efficiency supplemented 
by increased electricity-, hydrogen- and biofuelsbased transportation.
‚óè The increased deployment of renewables in 
South Africa is found to offer significant 
environmental (in terms of reduced emissions 
and air pollution, etc) and socio-economic 
benefits (in terms of health benefits, 
employment and financial savings).7.1 Renewable energy 
technologies in 2030 
Chapter 5 outlined the Reference¬† Case¬† 2030, which 
provides a projection to 2030 of the South African 
energy sector based on current government energy 
policy and plans. In the Reference¬† Case¬† 2030, the 
share of renewables in TFEC increases from 9% in 
2015 to 13% by 2030. 
The REmap Case 2030 represents additional 
renewable energy technology options, so-called 
‚ÄúREmap Options‚Äù, that are considered feasible and 
realistic in terms of both resource potential and 
technology deployment speed. REmap Options are 
not necessarily driven by economic cost minimisation 
criteria, but also consider positive externalities from 
renewables use, including emission reductions, health 
benefits, financial savings and employment creation 
potential (see Chapter 7, Section¬†3 of this study). 
Power sector technology potential 
beyond the Reference Case
The electricity sector projections of the REmap Case 
2030 are summarised in Figure¬† 7.1, in terms of 
generation capacity and production. Based on significant 
resource availability and the technology cost 
assumptions presented in Chapter 6, as well as the 
modelling undertaken for the draft IEP 2016, the 
dominant power sector technologies in the energy mix 
under the REmap Case 2030 are expected to be onshore 
wind (21%) and solar¬† PV (16%), with a supplementary 
role for hydro (7%; predominantly imported from the 
Southern African region) and bioenergy (4%). 
Although only a small deployment of CSP (1%) is 
foreseen, owing to the significant resource available 
across the country an increased role of CSP could be 
considered if technology costs decline sufficiently. A key 
benefit of CSP technology is dispatchability for the 
power system when coupled with storage. However, 
under the current design of the REIPPPP, this 
dispatchability only benefits project owners rather than 
the system operator, as the CSP projects are not system 
operator dispatched (but rather self-dispatched by the 
project owner).

Based on DoE (2016a)
Under the REmap Case 2030, the renewable energy share considerably
increases to 49% of the total electrical energy mix by 2030 (from 9% in
2015), driven mainly by the deployment of solar PV and wind technology.
Key insight:The expected share of renewable energy in the 
electricity sector under the Reference¬† Case¬† 2030 and 
REmap Case 2030 are compared in¬† Figure¬† 7.2. The 
share of renewable energy in electricity generation 
increases significantly in both the Reference¬†Case¬†2030 
(to 37% by 2030) and under the REmap Case (to 49% by 
2030). 
This increase reflects the increasing ambition of 
renewables use in the power sector, which is to a large 
degree driven by renewables deployment and the cost 
reductions realised under the REIPPPP in recent years, 
which are expected to further continue in the future 
(see Chapter 6).

Potential in end-use sectors
Under the Reference¬† Case¬† 2030, demand for energy 
in commercial buildings grows from 99 PJ in 2015 to 
149 PJ by 2030. Residential demand drops from 
344 PJ to 286 PJ by 2030, primarily due to 
electrification, which allows energy services demand 
to be met at higher efficiencies. Demand for energy in 
the industrial sector grows from 882 PJ in 2015 to 
1 143 PJ by 2030 whilst energy use in transport grows 
from 896 PJ to 1 195 PJ by 2030. Energy demand in 
the agricultural sector is expected to increase from 
69 PJ in 2015 to 83 PJ by 2030. This is the baseline for 
2030, taken from the draft IEP 2016. The largest 
potential for increasing the renewables share of TFEC 
in end-use sectors beyond the Reference Case 2030 
lies in the use of solar thermal and modern bioenergy 
for heating, cooling and cooking, whilst the transport 
sector could see increased use of electric mobility, 
hydrogen and biofuels. 
Both the Reference Case 2030 and REmap Case 2030 show consistent growth
of renewables share in the South African electricity sector, moving from 9% in
2015 to 37% and 49%, respectively, by 2030, dominated by wind and solar PV.
Key insight:The analysis also addresses the absolute reduction in 
energy end-use in each sector (beyond the Reference 
Case¬†2030) resulting from energy efficiency measures. 
Solar thermal
As illustrated in Chapter 6, South Africa has 
considerable solar resources. These resources can be 
applied to industrial process and water heating, as 
well as to water heating in the residential and 
commercial sectors. While there is an existing target 
for 1¬† million SWHs to be installed by 2030, the 
Reference¬†Case¬†2030 (as based on the draft IEP¬†2016 
Base Case) does not include any targets for solar 
thermal technology deployment. Yet, the ‚ÄúCleaner 
Pastures‚Äù scenario in the draft IEP¬† 2016 includes a 
target for 5¬† million SWHs by 2030 (not explicitly 
included in the outcomes), a figure¬† that originates 
from the National Development Plan of 2011. This 
figure¬†serves as benchmark for the REmap Case.
Currently, large-scale SWHs are used primarily to 
serve domestic water heating needs¬† (Joubert, Hess 
and Niekerk, 2016). The potential for solar thermal 
energy use via high-pressure SWHs, as an alternative 
to electric geysers,29 in the residential sector 
(i.e.¬†households) is dependent on the type of housing, 
access to water and the electrification status. Lowpressure SWHs could be deployed in low-income 
households to displace the use of other fuels including 
for electricity (e.g. coal) and petroleum products 
(e.g. liquefied petroleum gas, paraffin). The National 
Building Regulations (SANS¬† 10400) introduced in 
2011 require that 50% of water heating demand in 
new buildings be met with SWHs or heat pumps. If 
the overall share of water heating in energy end-use 
in the residential sector remains as it is today (21%), 
solar thermal heating of water could provide a 
considerable share of the estimated demand for 
household energy by 2030. In addition, as access to 
water and formal housing improves in South Africa, 
the share of water heating in energy end-use is likely 
to increase further. 
29 The term ‚Äúgeyser‚Äù is specific to a few countries. It means the 
same as tankless electric water heaters.
Assuming 60% and 40% shares of high-pressure and 
low-pressure SWHs, respectively, meeting the target 
for 5¬† million SWHs translates to an opportunity for 
SWHs to contribute ‚âà30 PJ towards household energy 
by 2030. This will require significant growth in the rate 
of SWH installations compared to current rates. SWHs 
displace electricity demand and therefore, at higher 
shares of renewable energy in electricity, the overall 
contribution of SWHs to renewables share reduces. 
In addition to individual households, large-scale SWHs 
can be installed in multi-unit residential dwellings 
(flats, residences, etc) and commercial properties. 
The South African Solar Thermal Technology
Roadmap¬† (CRSES, 2015) estimates a potential for 
around 4 million m¬≤ of commercial and industrial 
installations by 2030. Conservatively assuming an 
estimated heat output of around 
800 kWh/‚Ääm¬≤¬† (CRSES, 2015), there is potential for 
SWHs to supply 11.5 PJ of commercial and multi-unit 
residential water heating demand by 2030. Thus, the 
total deployment of solar thermal technologies in 
buildings (residential and commercial) under the 
REmap Case 2030 is ‚âà41 PJ.
In the industrial sector, large-scale SWHs can be 
installed in industries that have low-temperature heat 
requirements. The potential for SWHs to serve 
process needs in the industrial sector lies primarily in 
the food and beverage, textile, and chemical 
industries. Certain agri-processing sectors could also 
be applicable¬†(Janse van Vuuren et al., 2017). Due to 
the temporal and spatial variability of solar resources 
combined with the distribution of different industries 
throughout the country, estimates of the potential 
contribution of solar thermal heat to industry vary 
widely. The estimated potential for solar thermal use 
in industry by 2030 is around 3.4‚Äì15.5 PJ. In light of 
the baseline of negligible use of solar thermal in 2015, 
a moderate solar thermal use of around 6 PJ in 
industry is adopted under the REmap Case 2030, for 
process heating in the food and beverage, textile, and 
chemical industries. Bioenergy
Based on the Bioenergy Atlas for South Africa¬†(Hugo, 
2016), as presented in Chapter 6, there is a notable 
potential for bioenergy in the residential, commercial 
and industrial sectors. The bioenergy use identified 
in the industrial sector is predominantly for ownprocess heating purposes. The resource potential lies 
primarily in organic waste, forest and agricultural 
residues, and the eradication of invasive alien species 
(280 PJ of the total 350 PJ per year, excluding 
purposefully cultivated crops). 
Estimates of biogas potential (for electrical power 
generation or process heating) show widescale 
potential for livestock, meat processing and agroindustries, which is mostly located in the Western 
Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng. The largest 
potential for biogas lies in livestock, representing over 
50% of total biogas potential in all provinces except 
Limpopo and Gauteng. In KwaZulu-Natal and 
Mpumalanga, sugar mills dominate, whilst in the 
Western and Northern Cape wineries exhibit the 
largest potential. In these areas, biomass for process 
heat and/or electrical power generation could be 
considered. In much of the rest of South Africa, the 
potential is dominated by fruit processing and 
breweries (ARC, 2016). 
Assuming 30% of available biomass potential for 
thermal energy is utilised by 2030, biomass is 
estimated to supply up to 60 PJ of heat in the 
industrial sector as part of the REmap Case 2030 
(compared to no deployment of bioenergy in this 
sector under the Reference Case 2030). According to 
the Bioenergy Atlas, household or communal 
digesters in rural areas could contribute up to 
2 500 MW (10‚Äì16 TWh)¬† and are included in the 
REmap Case 2030 as distributed production. 
The REmap Case 2030 also includes limited use of 
traditional biomass (4 PJ) in buildings by 2030.
Biofuels (transportation)
Transport sector end-use was 896 PJ in 2015 and is 
projected to be 1 195 PJ by 2030 in the Reference 
Case¬†2030 based on the draft IEP 2016 Base Case (an 
increase of ‚âà35% between 2015 and 2030). 
Assuming they would be blended with existing liquid 
fuels (i.e. diesel and petrol), liquid biofuels are an 
important but limited option for higher renewable 
energy use in transportation in South Africa. As an 
indicator of this, the maximum resource potential for 
blends of 10% bioethanol (e10) and 100% biodiesel 
(b100) could only provide 65‚Äì70% of South African 
liquid fuel demand by 2030. However, land 
requirements for this would amount to approximately 
120 000‚Äì130 000 km¬≤, which is 9‚Äì11% of South 
Africa‚Äôs total land area and almost all existing arable 
land. Of course, importing biofuels could also be an 
option but would not assist in alleviating the liquid 
fuels import risk that South Africa currently faces.
Mandatory blending regulations have resulted in 
manufacturing licenses being issued for a total of 
‚âà400¬† million¬† litres for bioethanol per year and 
‚âà1000¬† million¬† litres of biodiesel per year. By 2020 
(i.e. the expected operational date of these 
regulations), this would meet a share of ‚âà4% of 
domestic petrol demand. Land-use requirements for 
this level of biofuel production would amount to 
‚âà6 000 km¬≤ (for soybean and grain sorghum for 
biodiesel and bioethanol, respectively), which 
equates to 0.5% of South Africa‚Äôs total land area. By 
2030, minimum blend regulations would require total 
land cultivation of around ‚âà7 000‚Äì7 500 km¬≤, 
amounting to a total of 39‚Äì42 PJ of liquid fuels from 
renewables (‚âà4% of total demand in the transport 
sector). Thus, 42 PJ of biofuels use (from a 
combination of ethanol and biodiesel blending) is 
assumed under the REmap Case 2030.Electricity, hydrogen and natural gas 
(transportation)
Aside from liquid biofuels in the transport sector, the 
opportunity exists for electricity, hydrogen and, 
potentially, biogenic natural gas (or conventional 
natural gas) to be key energy carriers that could 
enable a low-carbon transport sector in South Africa. 
Although the use of electricity, biofuels and hydrogen 
are described as potential alternative fuel sources as 
part of the draft¬† IEP¬† 2016, they are not explicitly 
included under the Base Case (and therefore in the 
Reference Case 2030 of this study).
Expected cost trajectories for EVs are currently quite 
conservative, and not very competitive relative to 
internal combustion engine¬† (ICE) vehicles in South 
Africa (see, for example, DoE, 2017b). 
This is summarised in¬† Figure¬† 7.3, which provides a 
relative comparison to recent global market outlook 
expectations from Bloomberg New Energy Finance 
(BNEF)¬†(Curry, 2017).30 Capital cost trajectories for 
EVs relative to conventional ICE vehicles (also 
shown based on data from BNEF and the draft IEP 
2016) have declined sharply in recent years and are 
expected to further decline in the future. 
Combining this with expectations for efficiency 
improvements in both ICE and EVs, the deployment 
of EVs is likely to increase significantly (including, 
relative to the minimal deployment in the 
Reference¬† Case¬† 2030). Yet, the adoption and 
acceleration of EV uptake is highly dependent on, 
and could be constrained by, the associated 
investment in and deployment of suitable and 
convenient EV charging infrastructure. 
30 The 2017 IRENA technology brief on EVs found that, in line 
with expected reductions in electric vehicle body and battery 
costs (and depending on the exact definition of costs), global 
EV total costs may reach parity with ICE vehicles in 2025 or 
even 2020. This is roughly in line with, while more optimistic 
than, the global cost trajectory presented in Figure¬†7.3.

Note: EV capital cost assumptions are normalised to BNEF in 2015.
Based on Curry (2017), DoE (2016f) and CSIR analysis
Significantly reduced costs for lithium-ion
batteries have made electric vehicles¬†(EVs)
increasingly cost-competitive with internal
combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, with
further expected capital cost reductions in
the future.
Key insight:With cost parity between EVs and ICE vehicles on the 
horizon, electric mobility for freight, private and 
public travel could potentially account for shares of 
15%, 20% and 2% (in terms of total vehicle-kilometres), 
respectively, of road transport activity in South Africa 
by 2030¬† (Caetano et al., 2017). Thus, by 2030, of a 
potential 15¬† million vehicles on the road, around 
2¬† million could be electric¬† (a 13% share). This will 
increase electrical energy demand but will also reduce 
the requirement for liquid fuels. A mix of new 
electrical generation capacity, predominantly 
renewables (wind and solar¬† PV) combined with 
flexible capacity (supply/demand side), would likely 
be required to meet this additional electricity demand 
(that amounts to an additional ‚âà7.5‚Äì10 TWh/yr). As a 
result, by 2030, liquid fuels (mostly petrol and diesel) 
would be displaced by an additional 27‚Äì36 PJ of 
electricity. Taking a conservative estimate of a total 
48 PJ electricity use in the transport sector by 2030, 
and assuming a 49% renewable energy share in 
electricity generation by 2030, 24 PJ are estimated as 
the REmap Option for renewable electricity use in 
transportation by 2030 (from about 2 PJ in 2015).31
31 In light of the quickly increasing global availability and sales of 
EVs, as well as the forecasted cost reductions, these 
projections for electricity use in the transport sector by 2030 
could yet be considered conservative, and projections may 
have to be adjusted upward in coming years, in line with market 
developments.
Furthermore, the Ricardo-AEA road vehicle cost and 
efficiency calculation framework 2010‚Äì2050 suggests 
that, globally, costs for natural gas and hydrogen 
fuelled vehicles could be comparable to EVs at least 
from 2030 onwards. The use of hydrogen and/or 
natural gas vehicles has not been included in current 
national energy planning in South Africa and could 
present a significant opportunity. Consumption of 
hydrogen could amount to 22 PJ in 2030 for fuel-cell 
vehicles for which electrolysis partially or fully 
powered by renewables could be possible. However, 
production of hydrogen via coal gasification or gas 
reformation are likely the economic preferences (if no 
binding constraints on carbon emissions are 
applicable). The estimate for renewables-based 
hydrogen use under the REmap Case 2030 is 11 PJ.
Although a potential 40 PJ of biogas substitution has 
been identified¬† (DEA, 2016), recent modelling 
indicates that these gas volumes may best serve as an 
interim transport fuel approaching 2030 with 
potentially 15 PJ of gas consumed during the period 
from 2020 to 2030¬† (Ahjum et al., 2018; DEA, 2016). 
As such, biogas is not considered a viable/contending 
fuel from 2030 onwards, as hydrogen and electricity 
emerge as primary competing fuels¬† (Ahjum et al., 
2018; DEA, 2016).
To complement the overview of technology options
(REmap Options) to 2030, Box¬†5 provides a summary
of potential future technology options that are not
accounted for in the REmap analysis. At this point,
quantifying the potential of these respective
technologies in South Africa would be merely
speculative, and is therefore avoided in this study.Box¬†5: Upcoming renewable energy (enabling) technologies
not reflected in the REmap Options
This box provides an overview of potential future technology options, based on literature research as well 
as on comments received at the two national stakeholder meetings that preceded this study.
The IEP and IRP explicitly account only for mature, commercial technologies that have a reasonably certain 
pathway for further development and use/deployment. In the same way, the REmap Options focus on 
commercial, mature technologies that have a proven track record and allow for robust, quantifiable 
assessments and recommendations. However, nascent renewables technologies that are not yet 
commercialised but could eventually reach maturity could also play a role in the future energy supply mix. 
In terms of power generation technologies, ocean/wave energy technology has reached a certain level of 
maturity. The long coastline of South Africa could provide ample opportunity for deployment, but the 
national potential and price levels have not been ascertained in detail. Key national stakeholders have 
suggested these aspects be analysed as part of a broader national strategy for research and development 
of ocean/wave energy. 
Other technologies that should be further assessed in the context of South Africa‚Äôs energy system are 
offshore wind, CSP and hydropower. In addition, the national stakeholders suggested the development of 
smart meters and smart grid infrastructure (especially for areas where embedded generation from solar 
PV will play a key role) be accelerated. In terms of enabling technologies for renewables power generation, 
storage options, including hydro pump storage (e.g. in the mining sector) and battery storage (Eskom is 
currently testing energy storage at grid level), should be further explored and their additional research 
requirements and deployment potential further ascertained. In addition, the option of flexibilisation of 
existing coal plants should be assessed (see Chapter 3, Section 2 of this study).
In addition to power sector technologies, additional research and development should be focused on 
renewables options for end-use sectors. Key technologies to be further explored include steam and heat 
production from solar thermal and use of hydrogen in industry (already considered by some industrial 
players in South Africa). Stellenbosch University in South Africa also ran a research and development 
project on solar thermal use in the mining sector, which could be an option for replacing fuel use for 
heating requirements.
In the transport sector, the increased use of hydrogen and fuel cells is being assessed (led by the 
Department of Science and Technology [DST], with some work supported by Gesellschaft f√ºr Internationale 
Zusammenarbeit [GIZ]). South Africa has more than 80% of the world‚Äôs platinum reserves (required for fuel 
cell production) and is well-placed to promote the technology. Yet, there are no comprehensive estimates 
of potential for hydrogen fuel cell use in the national transport sector by 2030. To assess the potential for 
hydrogen production from pyrolysis with renewables, South Africa is looking for lessons from Japan.¬≥¬≥ 
Additional research is focused on assessing the potential for hydrogen solar cells (by the National Resource 
Environment [NRE]) and for use of fuel cells in buildings. Overall, there is much active research on 
hydrogen and fuel cells, even though the technology needs to be developed to maturity, and its exact 
potential and actions need to be ascertained. 
32 In 2018, IRENA produced the publication Hydrogen from
renewable power: Technology outlook for the energy transition, 
which provides an overview of technology developments and 
an outlook. The work was kindly supported by the Government 
of Japan. The publication is available from the IRENA website, 
www.irena.org.Energy efficiency
The REmap Options for energy efficiency are based 
on the draft post-2015 NEES of South Africa. It 
includes targets to 2030 for energy efficiency in all 
energy-use sectors. These targets are not reflected in 
the draft IEP 2016 Base Case, and therefore not 
captured in the Reference Case 2030. 
The post-2015 NEES targets in the industrial sector 
include energy savings of 40 PJ in mining and a 16% 
improvement in energy efficiency in manufacturing by 
2030 resulting in savings of 146 PJ. In addition, a 37% 
reduction in specific energy consumption in the 
commercial sector by 2030 (compared to 2015) leading 
to savings of 17 PJ (note: partly attributed as savings in 
the industry sector under REmap Case). The post-2015 
NESS also includes targets for improving the efficiency 
of new appliances by 33% by 2030 relative to 2015 in 
the residential sector and for improving the average 
thermal performance of buildings by 20%, resulting in a 
20 PJ saving in residential sector energy end-use.
33 For a global stock-take and trends of energy technology 
innovation, see the work of the IRENA Innovation team and the 
IRENA technology briefs that are available from the IRENA 
website, www.irena.org. The report Innovation landscape for a
renewable-powered future: Solutions to integrate variable
renewables brings together key insights on emerging
innovations in the power sector.
These measures across the industrial, commercial and 
residential sectors amount to total savings of 223 PJ 
by 2030 as part of the REmap Case 2030. Finally, 
energy efficiency in the transport sector, as a result of 
improved vehicle efficiency, yields savings of 140 PJ 
as part of the REmap Case 2030 (as derived from 
Ricardo-AEA, 2012), which can be regarded as an 
optimistic evolution. Combined, these savings reduce 
the TFEC in the REmap Case 2030 by 363 PJ relative 
to the Reference Case 2030.
Figure¬† 7.4 shows the draft post-2015 NEES results 
framework, including the targets introduced above 
(note that some of the sector-specific efficiency 
targets are not adopted as part of the REmap Case 
2030). The DoE has a vision to promote energy 
efficiency as the ‚Äúfirst fuel‚Äù in driving a balanced, 
socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable 
energy sector that supports economic growth. 
South Africa should also further assess options for efficiency improvements across all sectors. As outlined 
below, the draft post-2015 NEES sets out the targets for all energy-use sectors to 2030. The post-2015 
NEES serves as central reference point for national energy efficiency ambition. 
Besides technology deployment potential, these nascent technologies may also drive the development of a 
domestic manufacturer market for full systems or parts. When exploring new renewables technologies, 
South Africa should consider opportunities for creating a domestic manufacturing basis or for contributing 
to the technology value chain, and identify support policies. 
Generally, for all these potential future technology options, further work needs to be done to understand 
their potential and the research and development required to achieve maturity and commercialisation.¬≥4
At this point in time, quantifying the potential of these respective technologies in South Africa would be 
merely speculative, and is therefore avoided in this study. Potential for small-scale renewables
Small-scale renewables in this context refers to 
renewable energy capacity that could be stand-alone 
and small individually (in the kW range) but could also 
aggregate up to large overall renewable energy 
contributions. These renewables in the form of 
distributed and embedded generation capacity have 
not yet scaled significantly in South Africa (there were 
negligible deployment levels in 2015). Compared to the 
utility-scale REIPPPP, the small-scale REIPPPP has 
reached a rather small total scale (see Chapter 3, 
Section 2 of this study for additional information about 
the small-scale REIPPPP and the awarded bidders).
The South African standard for grid interconnection of 
embedded generation, NRS¬† 097-2-3:2014¬† (SABS, 
2014b), provides simplified utility connection criteria 
for embedded generators that are smaller than 1 MW 
in low voltage (LV) distribution networks. 
Included in the criteria is an allowable connection 
limitation for total installed embedded generation 
peak power capacity of 15% of the upstream medium 
voltage (MV) feeder‚Äôs peak load before more detailed 
grid impact studies would be required. This is inclusive 
of all potential embedded generator types. 
Compliance to this standard is not yet a national legal 
requirement, and discretion can be exercised by 
owners of LV distribution networks. Yet, the standard 
does provide a useful and helpful benchmark for 
future grid interconnection at LVs. This will inherently 
limit the initial deployment of favourable small-scale 
generation technologies like solar¬† PV but should not 
be a long-term binding constraint. Deployment of 
solar PV in these sectors could also be constrained by 
the availability of accessible roof and land area, actual 
localised network capacity, and affordability (or 
access to finance).

Significantly reduced costs for lithium-ion batteries have made electric
vehicles¬†(EVs) increasingly cost-competitive with internal combustion engine
(ICE) vehicles, with further expected capital cost reductions in the future.
Key insight:As an upper estimate of the potential for rooftop 
solar PV, it was shown that in settlement areas of 
South Africa, 72¬†GW (136 TWh or 38 PJ) of solar¬†PV 
potential is available for deployment on rooftops 
(Knorr et al., 2016). This can be considered an 
absolute upper limit to potential rooftop solar PV 
deployment if all households in settlement areas 
deploy rooftop solar PV. In 2016, deployment levels 
of rooftop solar PV in South Africa was estimated to 
be 280 MW. 
Demand for electricity in the commercial and 
residential sectors is expected to grow considerably, 
with over 60% and 25% growth, respectively, 
between 2015 and 2030 in the Reference¬†Case¬†2030. 
Similar growth is assumed under the REmap Case 
2030. In the commercial sector specifically, rooftop 
solar¬† PV installations are becoming increasingly 
viable as solar¬† PV technology costs decline and 
wholesale electricity prices increase. In combination 
with the good correlation between the electricity 
demand profile of commercial end-users and the 
supply profile of solar PV, this could further drive 
significant deployment of rooftop solar¬† PV in the 
future. 
A 2014 study of perceptions of solar PV affordability 
in the commercial sector in the Western Cape 
showed that many businesses already consider 
solar¬†PV to be competitive and worth considering as 
an alternative electrical energy option (Millson, 
2014). Taking all factors into account, Conservative 
estimates suggest that rooftop solar¬† PV in the 
commercial sector in South Africa could be 
0.5‚Äì‚Ää0.9¬†GW¬†(‚âà0.9‚Äì1.7 TWh or 3.3‚Äì6.0 PJ) by 203034
under the REmap Case 2030, which is similar to the 
Reference Case 2030.
Correlations between residential electricity demand 
and solar¬† PV generation profiles are lower, since 
household demand peaks in the evening. 
34 This estimate is based on an indicative increase in commercial 
floor area from 137 km¬≤ (in 2015) to 170 km¬≤ (by 2030), an 
estimated roof area of ‚âà25‚Äì30 km¬≤ and an installation potential 
of 20‚Äì30 MW/km¬≤ by 2030.
Even so, rooftop solar PV combined with deployment 
of stationary electrical energy storage (batteries) 
could also allow for considerable deployment in 
future. Uptake of embedded solar¬†PV by households 
(including off-grid installations) is highly dependent 
on affordability. 
In 2015, approximately 14% of households in South 
Africa had an income above ZAR¬† 153 000 
(‚âàUSD¬† 10 930) per year. Household income is 
projected to grow in real terms, and by 2030 the 
percentage of households in this income band is 
estimated to increase to 25%. Of these households, 
‚âà80% live in single-family dwellings, 12% live in 
medium-density houses and the remaining 8% live in 
high-density flats. Conservatively, assuming a 15% 
embedded solar¬†PV uptake in the residential sector, 
the REmap Case 2030 estimates that 
1.4-2.0¬† GW¬† (2.5‚Äì3.7 TWh or 9.0‚Äì13 PJ) of gridconnected electricity could be provided by rooftop 
solar¬†PV by 2030. 
The New Household Electrification Strategy of 2013 
recognised that grid electrification will not reach all 
households. It identified a target to electrify 300 000 
households with high-quality non-grid solutions by 
2025 (see Chapter 5, Section 2 of this study). If these 
households are supplied with electricity at the Tier3 
SE4ALL level of 322‚Äì‚Ää1 318 kWh/yr¬† (Bhatia and 
Angelou, 2015), with SHSs and/or integrated off-grid 
systems including biogas digesters, supplying these 
households could translate to an additional 0.4‚Äì1.4 PJ 
(0.1‚Äì0.4 TWh) of renewables end-use as part of the 
REmap Case 2030. 
In sum, assuming the upper bounds for all the 
deployment options, the total expected distributed 
power generation from solar PV in the REmap Case is 
5.8 TWh, including 1.7 TWh in commercial rooftop 
deployment, 3.7 TWh in residential rooftop uses, and 
0.4 TWh for new off-grid SHSs. 7.2 REmap Case 2030 mix 
and roadmap table
This section serves to bring all the findings from 
Chapter 7, Section 1 together and present the overall 
picture under the REmap Case 2030. Based on the 
REmap Options presented in Chapter 7, Section 1, the 
expected TPES and TFEC by energy carrier for the 
REmap Case 2030 are summarised in Figures 7.5 and 
7.6, respectively. Figure¬† 7.7 compares the overall 
expected share of renewable energy in TFEC under 
the REmap Case and Reference¬†Case¬†2030. 
The specific uptake of renewables across all end-use 
sectors for the REmap Case 2030 is graphically shown 
in Figure¬† 7.8. Table 7.1 presents the technology 
deployment in all energy-use sectors for 2015, 
Reference Case 2030 and REmap Case 2030. 
As illustrated in Figure¬† 7.5, under the REmap Case 
2030, TPES is expected to decrease slightly from 
4 555 PJ in 2015 to 4 407 PJ by 2030 with a smaller 
(while still dominant) role for coal relative to the 
Reference Case 2030. The use of renewable energy is 
significantly increased and replaces some use of fossil 
fuels, especially of coal.

Based on DoE (2016a) and CSIR analysisAs seen in¬†Figure¬†7.6, TFEC is expected to grow 1.1x 
by 2030 with the largest relative growth expected in 
the commercial sector (50% growth, from 99 PJ in 
2015 to 149 PJ by 2030). The TFEC by energy carrier 
under the REmap Case 2030 (presented in Figure¬†7.7) 
reveals how the role of coal in end-use moves slightly 
from 12% in 2015 to 11% by 2030 with an increased 
role for direct use of renewables (in the form of 
bioenergy and solar thermal energy). Electricity 
continues to contribute significantly to energy enduse as an energy carrier contributing 839 PJ of TFEC 
by 2030 (34%), as compared to 780 PJ in 2015 (34%). 
The end-use of liquid fuels, predominantly in the 
transport sector, also stays relatively constant at 
around 45% of TFEC (1 035 PJ in 2015 to 1 125 PJ by 
2030). The end-use of traditional bioenergy as an 
energy carrier (mostly in the residential sector) is 
expected to shift away from traditional forms of 
bioenergy to modern forms of bioenergy and 
electricity, which results in similar absolute levels of 
bioenergy in end-use by 2030 (106 PJ by 2030, 
compared to 127 PJ in 2015).
The REmap Case 2030 shows how the share of 
modern renewables could increase from 62 PJ (3% of 
TFEC) in 2015 to 564 PJ (23% of TFEC) by 2030, 
based on technology options that have been identified 
as available (in terms of resources) and technically 
feasible (in terms of technology deployment speed). 
As outlined in Chapter 7, Section 1, implicit energy 
efficiency savings in the REmap Case 2030 total 
363 PJ of TFEC, dominated by energy efficiency in the 
industrial sector followed by transportation (there is a 
relative reduction of TFEC by 15% from energy 
efficiency savings).
As part of the REmap Case 2030, the industrial sector 
could increase its contribution of renewables from 
42 PJ in 2015 to 290 PJ by 2030 (an increase from 5% 
of sector end-use in 2015 to 30% by 2030). This would 
be driven mostly by renewables deployment in the 
electricity sector (225 PJ) combined with options for 
bioenergy in wood and pulp, paper and print 
industries (60 PJ) as well as solar thermal technologies 
for process heating in the food and beverage, textile, 
and chemical industries (6 PJ).
In the transport sector, REmap Options identified for 
further renewables share include the electrification 
of transportation (24 PJ), limited blending of 
biodiesel (24 PJ) and ethanol (18 PJ) into liquid fuels 
as well as the use of hydrogen based on renewable 
power (11 PJ). This results in the share of renewables 
in the transport sector moving from a little over 0% 
of the 896 PJ TFEC in 2015 to 7% (76 PJ) of end-use 
by 2030 (total transport sector end-use of 1 054 PJ 
by 2030). This share of renewables under the REmap 
Case 2030 is considerably higher than under the 
Reference¬†Case 2030.
For buildings (commercial and residential), TFEC is 
expected to decrease from 443 PJ in 2015 to 401 PJ 
by 2030. The absolute reduction is dominated by the 
near-complete removal of traditional biomass enduse in the residential sector to more efficient energy 
carriers (4 PJ use of traditional biomass by 2030). 
REmap Options for these sectors include solar 
thermal for process and water heating¬†(41 PJ) and an 
increased use of electricity (increasingly based on 
renewables by 2030 ‚Äì 142 PJ). Under the REmap 
Case 2030, buildings (residential and commercial) 
move from a modern renewables‚Äô share of 4% of 
sector end-use in 2015 (23 PJ) to 46% by 2030 
(183 PJ). This is considerably higher than the 
Reference Case¬†2030 (135 PJ of modern renewables; 
share of 31%). 
In the agricultural sector, REmap Options identified 
include the use of solar thermal technologies for 
process, water and space heating (specifically in agriprocessing) whilst electricity with increasing levels of 
renewables continues to be used. The energy end-use 
in agriculture moves from 69 PJ in 2015 where 
modern renewables contributed 3% (2 PJ) to an 
energy end-use of 83 PJ by 2030 with modern 
renewables contributing 18% (15 PJ). This is almost 
entirely accounted for by renewables-based 
electricity, while the use of solar thermal and biomass 
residues is rather marginal. Under the Reference Case, 
renewables are expected to contribute 13% (11 PJ) in 
the agricultural sector by 2030.Figure¬†7.6: TFEC by energy carrier (REmap Case 2030)

Options 
Under the REmap Case, annual CO‚ÇÇ emissions are 
expected to decline by 25% from ‚âà388¬†Mt in 2015 to 
‚âà295¬† Mt/yr by 2030. The combined emissions from 
liquid fuels and electricity decrease significantly as 
part of REmap Case 2030, from ‚âà310¬† Mt in 2015 to 
195¬†Mt/yr by 2030. CO‚ÇÇ emissions from other sectors, 
including transportation and final end-use, grow from 
‚âà80¬†Mt in 2015 to ‚âà100 Mt/yr by 2030.
As shown in Figure¬† 7.9, the emissions under the 
REmap Case 2030 are considerably lower than 
under the Reference Case 2030, where emissions 
grow from ‚âà390¬†Mt in 2015 to ‚âà454¬†Mt/yr by 2030; 
the difference in CO‚ÇÇ emissions is almost 160¬†Mt/yr 
by 2030. The reductions under the REmap Case 
2030 stem mainly from electricity and liquid fuels 
use, as there is a notable increase in renewables in 
the power sector combined with a notable 
electrification of the transport sector and blending 
of biofuels.

Increased energy efficiency and deployment of renewables as part of the
REmap Case result in significant reduction in energy sector CO‚ÇÇ emissions
by 2030.
Key insight:Besides the reduced CO‚ÇÇ emissions from increased 
deployment of renewable energy compared to current 
policies and strategies, different analyses have also 
observed positive impacts of increased renewables 
deployment in South Africa in terms of health 
benefits, employment and financial savings. 
For example, IASS, CSIR and other partners (2019), 
based on a national dialogue process, developed a 
series of four studies that assess different co-benefits 
of decarbonising the power sector in South Africa. 
Their study on skills and job creation finds that 
increasing the share of renewable energy in the 
electricity production mix of South Africa can lead to 
positive net employment effects in the power sector 
despite significant job losses in the coal sector. The 
analysis finds that increasing the share of renewables 
can be expected to increase employment by 40% in 
the period 2018 to 2030, translating to an additional 
580 000 job years35 along the renewable energy value 
chain. In addition to an increased number of jobs, 
there is also an expected gain in the quality of jobs; 
the share of high-skilled jobs in the economy is 
expected to grow. 
The large majority of the employment gains are 
concentrated in service sectors (trade, financial, 
business, sales) while some new employment 
opportunities also arise in renewable energy 
technology manufacturing and other industries (IASS 
and CSIR, 2019a). The majority of additional jobs in 
the national power sector are located in the solar PV 
and wind segments. 
35 ‚ÄúJob years‚Äù are defined as the total number of jobs multiplied 
by the (maximum) number of years for which those jobs are 
required. An alternative measure is ‚Äújobs‚Äù (the number of 
people employed) (IASS and CSIR, 2019a).
At the same time, in line with coal capacity reductions, 
there is an expected 35‚Äì40% decline in coal¬† sectorbased employment between 2020 and 2050, which 
corresponds to around 19 000 jobs in total (IASS and 
CSIR, 2019a). The South African Federation of Trade 
Unions even estimated that without measures to 
safeguard the livelihoods of mining and energy 
workers, some 40 000 jobs will be lost (SAFTU, 2018). 
The process needs to be managed politically, and a 
broader strategy is required for a ‚Äújust transition‚Äù in 
the coal sector and other sectors negatively impacted 
by the renewable energy transition, to mitigate 
negative impacts on affected workers and 
communities. Support will be especially crucial for 
current coal mining regions and workers, including 
through the establishment of new industries in coal 
regions, offers of re-skilling trainings for coal workers 
and other supporting measures. 
Many powerful national actors, like trade unions, 
support the move to renewable energy while 
demanding the government enact ‚Äújust transition‚Äù 
measures. For example, the German government 
established a national commission to set out an 
agreement that can align social, economic and 
environmental objectives for the coal phase-out 
schedule and for accompanying support measures for 
communities and workers (Greenpeace, 2019). A 
similar commission could be set up in South Africa to 
foster a dialogue and develop a comprehensive coal 
phase-out plan. Such actions will also be crucial to 
foster social acceptance for the renewable energy 
transition (Cock, 2019).In addition to job gains, the increased renewables 
deployment in South Africa can lead to significant 
health benefits. The health costs of coal 
power generation in 2018 were estimated at 
USD¬† 0.79-2.14¬† billion (ZAR¬† 11‚Äì30¬† billion36), which 
translates to a health cost externality of 
USD¬† 0.0038-0.0107/kWh (ZAR¬† 0.05‚Äì0.15/kWh) of 
coal-based electricity. 
The health effects are most severe in those areas 
where coal-fired power plants are located 
(e.g.¬†Highveld Priority Area [IASS and CSIR, 2019b]). 
Increasing the deployment of renewables in line with 
the draft IRP 2018 update (see Box¬† 4), compared 
with the Reference Case 2030, could cut health costs 
from the power sector by an estimated 25%. In 
absolute terms, this would mean savings of 
USD 0.27‚Äì0.91¬† billion (ZAR¬† 3.8‚Äì‚Ää12.7¬† billion) healthrelated costs by 2035 (IASS and CSIR, 2019b). 
Some ‚Äúlow-hanging fruits‚Äù that have been identified, 
including the decommissioning of Eskom‚Äôs oldest 
and dirtiest coal-fired power plants in the 2020s, 
which could significantly reduce health costs in the 
medium term, including health impacts on workforce 
productivity (around 27% of health costs are 
associated with restricted activity days) (IASS and 
CSIR, 2019b). 
36 The ZAR values in this section were converted at an exchange 
rate of ZAR 14 = USD 1.
Notably, these health savings only refer to reduced 
coal power generation, while additional significant 
health benefits are expected from the reduced 
combustion of fuels resulting from increased 
renewables use and improved energy efficiency in 
end-use sectors. 
The increased deployment of renewable energy can 
also lead to significant financial savings for producers 
and consumers. For example, due to the large 
increases in tariffs in recent years and the rapid 
decrease in the cost of solar PV systems, solar 
rooftop systems are estimated to offer residential 
prosumers savings in the range of USD¬†14.29‚Äì38.79 
(ZAR¬†200‚Äì543) per month for a representative 2kW 
system. IASS and CSIR (2019c) find that combined 
annual savings for residential prosumers in the 
metropolitan areas of South Africa could add up to 
around USD¬†0.91¬†trillion (ZAR¬†12.8¬†trillion) by 2030. 
For typical commercial customers, annual savings 
achieved in a 1 MW system could range from 
USD¬†1 429‚Äì‚Ää4 708 (ZAR¬†20 000‚Äì65 914). This serves 
as an example of the vast potential for financial 
savings from deploying renewable energy options 
across the energy sector. 8 CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES 
FOR A RENEWABLE ENERGY TRANSITION
KEY POINTS
‚óè The opportunities for additional deployment of 
renewable energy in different energy-use 
sectors are assessed in Chapter 7 from a 
technology perspective and with regard to 
environmental and socio-economic implications. 
This chapter identifies the key challenges and 
barriers for realising the options by sector. For 
each sector, it then discusses opportunities to 
set appropriate framework and enabling 
conditions to seize the technology options.
‚óè There are several challenges and barriers to 
increasing the share of renewable energy. These 
include the need to understand implications for 
national power system operations, the creation 
and employment of new business models for 
disruptive technologies, and the emergence of 
prosumers.
‚óè Small-scale embedded generation (SSEG) 
presents a unique challenge for municipalities 
that are generally interested in exploring the 
possibilities for deploying renewable energy in 
their jurisdictions. A key need in this regard is 
an evolving regulatory framework for 
municipalities to provide clarity on their role in 
the generation space. 
‚óè Key opportunities to enhance the additional 
deployment of renewable energy exist in sector 
coupling (i.e. using renewable energy-based 
electricity in transportation and heating), in using 
renewables as an input to the production of liquid 
fuels and chemicals (i.e. power-to-X), and in 
increasing the options for and the use of SSEG. 
‚óè The South African industrial sector is very 
energy-intensive and offers major opportunities 
for energy efficiency. This may be accelerated by 
introducing reporting requirements for major 
energy consumers.
‚óè As presented in Chapter 7, biofuels and electric 
mobility are key opportunities for increasing the 
use of renewables in the transport sector. To 
grow, biofuels require the implementation of 
existing national policy for blending into 
petroleum fuels, while electric mobility requires 
adequate infrastructure, as well as basic 
incentives that fairly recognise its benefits in 
terms of dispatchable load and of emission 
reductions (provided that input electricity is 
generated from renewable sources).
Based on the technology options identified in Chapter 
7, this chapter outlines the main existing barriers and 
challenges for realising the REmap Options to 2030 by 
energy-use sector.
For each sector, it then discusses opportunities to set 
appropriate framework and enabling conditions for 
seizing the technology options. Finally, Chapter 9 
offers suggestions for concrete measures and next 
steps. 8.1 Current challenges and 
opportunities in the power 
sector
South Africa has the largest power system in Africa 
with approximately 6¬† million customers (including 
individuals, municipalities, large industrial users, etc) 
served by the national utility Eskom. South Africa 
also exhibits comparatively high levels of electricity 
access compared to other countries in Sub-Saharan 
Africa. Over the last five years, the power system 
has seen increasing participation of the private 
sector through IPPs offering gas, coal and 
renewables-based power generation. Disruptive 
technologies such as SSEG, particularly solar PV, are 
challenging traditional approaches to expanding and 
operating the power system, with marked impacts 
on the current business models of the national utility 
and municipalities. Although there are several 
diverging views on the pace of electricity demand 
growth in South Africa, the future power system 
must evidently exhibit more diversity of generation 
options in order to enhance the supply security and 
reduce the high dependence on fossil fuels that 
yields high carbon and pollutant emissions. 
Renewable energy presents a path for 
diversification. The barriers and challenges 
described in this chapter highlight some of the 
potential hindrances to this path. Parallel to the 
growth in national electricity demand, several old 
coal-fired power plants are being evaluated to 
assess the merits of extending their operational 
lifetime. Indeed, the recently released draft IRP 2018 
update includes targets for decommissioning a total 
of 12.0¬†GW by 2030 and 33.8¬†GW by 2050 (see Box¬†4). 
Where coal power plants are decommissioned in the 
coming decades, there will be a magnified need for 
new generation options to avoid future shortfalls in 
electricity supply. 
The barriers and challenges also highlight areas 
where South Africa may need to adopt new 
approaches¬†‚Äì¬†hence, new opportunities also emerge. 
The optimal path for development of the power 
system is informed by policy directives, the costs of 
the various generation options, and the characteristics 
of available supply options and their environmental 
and social impacts. Along all these parameters there 
are disparate views and uncertainties about how 
different development paths for the power system will 
affect South Africa. These areas of uncertainty 
present a challenge in their own right and can 
contribute to policy uncertainty if not investigated 
thoroughly. The following points attempt to yield 
some certainty with regard to key barriers and 
challenges in the power sector that require further 
analysis or action in South Africa, but also with regard 
to related opportunities. 
Understanding the power system impacts of 
deploying renewable energy
The benefits of renewable energy are well 
understood and appreciated in South Africa, 
particularly from an environmental perspective. The 
drive for increased levels of renewable energy, 
however, needs to consider multiple aspects, 
including the impact on power system operations. 
As part of their review of the draft IRP 2016 update, 
CSIR (Wright et al., 2017a) undertook an analysis of 
the levels of VRE that the national grid system could 
handle. They found that 20‚Äì25% of variable 
renewables by 2030 is least-cost optimal but the 
system could probably handle a significantly higher 
amount as new flexible capacity is deployed to 
complement variable wind and solar PV. Increased 
flexibility of the system is expected as more inflexible 
coal is decommissioned (while options for 
flexibilisation of remaining coal capacity should be 
assessed). Storage technology could add to this. The REIPPPP deployed¬†0.5‚Äì0.75¬†GW per year of wind 
and solar¬†PV, respectively, between 2013‚Äì2017¬†(largely 
limited by the procurement of additional renewables) 
(Calitz and Wright, 2017). This is 1‚Äì2% of South Africa‚Äôs 
maximum system demand per year from a nascent 
renewables industry. In terms of international 
experiences from wind deployment, Germany, Spain 
and Ireland installed on average 2.7‚Äì4.6% of maximum 
power system demand between 2006 and 2016 whilst 
developing countries like China, India and Brazil 
installed on average 1.7‚Äì2.5% of maximum power 
system demand in the same period (Wright et al., 
2017b). Similarly, for solar PV, Germany, Spain and 
Italy installed 1.3‚Äì5.4% of maximum power system 
demand between 2007 and 2015 whilst others like 
Japan, India and China installed 0.4‚Äì1.9% of maximum 
power system demand during the same period. For 
South Africa‚Äôs power system, at least 1.4‚Äì2.5¬† GW/yr 
for wind and 0.7‚Äì3.0¬† GW/yr for solar PV should be 
possible by 2030. This is well above the level of 
deployment identified in the REmap Case 2030.
A further detailed assessment is required to determine 
the grid stability impacts of various levels of variable 
renewable energy penetration. Particularly, total solar 
PV and wind penetration levels of 30‚Äì40% by 2030 
would require some additional technical analysis in 
terms of system stability and flexibility. Further 
research is required to assess the levels at which VREbased generation starts to cause grid operation 
outside prescribed technical limits. Power system 
inertia is a key parameter when assessing the 
operation of the grid. This topic is currently receiving 
much attention from the national utility and 
researchers trying to understand which remedial 
actions are most cost-effective to accommodate 
higher levels of variable renewables deployment. A 
more detailed understanding of the grid stability 
impacts can remove or nuance the perception that an 
increased penetration of variable renewables poses a 
significant threat to the safe and efficient operation of 
the power grid. Also, the national power system must 
adhere to a grid code and operate within defined 
technical limits.
Ageing grid infrastructure
The national utility has an expansive transmission grid 
network and strategic plans that identify potential 
bottlenecks up to ten years in advance, based on the 
forecasted demand and generation mix. At the 
distribution level, however, many municipalities have 
severe backlogs in terms of distribution-grid 
maintenance. According to an approach-todistribution-asset-management report, the backlog in 
maintenance, rehabilitation and strengthening work 
for electricity infrastructure amounted to around 
ZAR¬† 27¬† billion (USD 1.93 billion37) in 2008 and had 
increased to ZAR¬†68¬†billion (USD 4.86 billion) by 2014. 
Moreover, this backlog has continued rising, according 
to NERSA (EE Publishers, 2016a). Poorly maintained 
and ageing distribution grids limit prospects for more 
renewable energy-based SSEG, particularly in the 
residential sector. 
With a significant share of variable renewables in the 
power sector identified as part of the country‚Äôs 
REmap Options, there will be an implicit need to 
ensure that sufficient network infrastructure is 
developed in a timely and appropriate manner. The 
range of integration challenges experienced globally 
in power systems with high penetrations of solar¬† PV 
and wind will need to be sufficiently addressed in 
South Africa‚Äôs context as VRE penetration levels 
increase. A stable and resilient electrical power 
system is essential, and planning in this regard should 
be adequately prioritised.
This also links to the broader need to increase 
investments in national power-sector infrastructure, 
particularly to address supply shortages, avoid the 
resulting need for load-shedding, avert grid collapse, 
and strengthen the network. These considerations are 
further outlined in Box¬†2 and Chapter 9, Section 2.
37 USD values are based on an exchange rate of ZAR 14 = USD 1.Limited experience with new business models
The South African electricity sector is characterised by 
a vertically integrated utility with a virtual monopoly in 
generation and transmission. In terms of electricity 
distribution, the national utility and municipalities are 
the primary actors. Over the last ten years, this 
operating model has experienced difficulties, with 
several episodes of national load shedding, falling 
electricity demand, competition from disruptive pricecompetitive technologies and increasing 
environmental constraints. 
This calls for an assessment of whether the current 
business models and institutional structures are still 
adequate. There is, however, limited local experience 
with alternative business models for the future 
electricity supply industry. The long-standing status 
quo may create resistance because the implications of 
various reforms are not fully understood. For example, 
potential reforms may include: 
‚óè Restructuring the national utility to separate the 
generation and transmission businesses. Through 
this, an independent market and transmission 
operator could be created. 
‚óè Evolving the distribution business structure and 
business models to move away from selling energy 
and rather securing revenue on the basis of using 
grid infrastructure as an enabler, where energy is 
traded across the grid infrastructure.
Financial challenges at the national utility (Eskom)
Despite the fact that electricity tariffs have increased 
by over 300% since 2000, the financial standing of the 
national power utility (Eskom) has deteriorated. 
Furthermore, the tariff increases impact the 
competitiveness of South African industries and have 
indirectly led to a decline in grid-based electricity 
demand as businesses have closed or have resorted to 
alternative electricity supply options. Its high levels of 
debt and the falling electricity demand suggest 
further future price increases by Eskom (e.g. in 2017 
Eskom requested a 19.9% tariff increase from the 
regulator). The severe financial challenges may also 
affect Eskom‚Äôs ability to act as an offtake buyer for 
PPAs with renewable energy IPPs. 
An alternative approach to a single-buyer model could 
be to create a power pool structure and allow Eskom 
to operate as a market participant, including investing 
into renewable energy. Such an approach could 
increase the value of the company and benefit 
consumers (by means of cheaper prices).
Updating the Integrated Resource Plan (IRP)
All national power sector stakeholders take a keen 
interest in the IRP for the insight it provides into 
government plans for future electricity supply. Over the 
last seven years since the completion of the IRP¬†2010‚Äì
2030, the costs of renewable energy technologies have 
decreased at a pace that has exceeded expectations. 
Although these cost reductions benefit the renewable 
energy sector, they have also posed a challenge in 
terms of ensuring that the IRP and its ambition remain 
aligned with market realities. There is a need to ensure 
the timeliness of completing and approving IRP updates 
while maintaining the rigour, review, transparency and 
due process of IRP updates, including comments from 
multiple stakeholders and approval from several 
government actors. 
Institutional barriers 
Securing unhindered, transparent and consistent access 
to the transmission network requires a neutral and 
independent party that matches electricity supply from 
generators to demand from customers in real time. Such 
a market co-ordination entity may require reforms to the 
current institutional structure of the sector. South Africa‚Äôs 
draft plans to implement an independent system and 
market operator could be revisited for implementation in 
a manner suited to the national context and conditions.
Regulatory barriers
The regulatory framework for utility-scale renewable 
energy projects is clear and proved to be most 
effective for utility-scale renewable energy projects. 
SSEG, typically installed within municipal distribution 
networks, has emerged as a new frontier for 
deployment of renewables, particularly solar PV. 
Regulations to enable the procurement and 
deployment of small-scale and distributed power 
generation capacity at the local government level 
(municipalities) are currently still evolving.Furthermore, in 2017 the DoE published the Licensing 
Exemption and Registration Notice under the 
Electricity Regulation Act. Despite the clarity provided 
by this notice, the Municipal Finance Management Act 
does not allow municipalities to enter into 
procurement agreements for longer than three years. 
This presents a barrier for renewable energy projects 
given that long-term PPAs (i.e. generally, 15 to 25 
years) with favourable tariffs are required to enable 
financing of such projects. There are means to 
overcome this barrier, such as following the steps set 
out in Section 33 of the Municipal Finance 
Management Act. This provision calls for wider and 
more extensive consultation with stakeholders 
regarding any contract that exceeds a period of three 
years (SEA and USAID, 2016).
Several opportunities exist in the South African power 
sector. Their realisation can enhance several policyrelated objectives, including increasing the diversity 
and security of electricity supply, reducing the carbon 
footprint of the power sector and supporting 
domestic industrial development.
Small-scale embedded generation (SSEG)
The growing trend of electricity consumers generating 
electricity for self-consumption presents the 
opportunity for municipalities (and other electricity 
distributors) to diversify their service offering. 
Municipalities may step into the role of being a 
provider of such embedded systems and thereby 
preserve their share of the distribution market, albeit 
under a different business model. In addition, buying 
excess electricity from local renewable energy 
generators can mitigate against rising electricity 
prices from the wholesale market and limit the 
exposure of distributors to high peak-time electricity 
pricing. Purchases of excess power (i.e. effectively 
using the distribution grid as a ‚Äústorage‚Äù medium) 
would maintain the use of the grid while avoiding 
unnecessary investment in energy storage by 
end-consumers. 
Promoting embedded generation in distribution 
networks can also potentially delay investments in 
transmission infrastructure that are needed to deliver 
electricity from large centralised power plants to endconsumers. Placing more generation assets closer to 
points of consumption can also reduce energy losses 
associated with long-distance transmission. The solar 
industry in South Africa has the capability to install 
small-scale embedded solar PV at a rate of over 
500 MW per year. This pace would provide a 
meaningful offtake for solar PV modules and other 
components manufactured locally.
The advent of SSEG also presents distributors with 
the opportunity to revisit the manner in which wire 
costs are recovered, leading to changes in tariff 
structure and more transparent charges for wires and 
energy-related costs. 
Bioenergy and cogeneration
Significant potential exists in South Africa for power 
generation from sugar mills, particularly in KwaZuluNatal Province (see Chapter 6, Section 1 for further 
information). At present, the sugar industry is 
experiencing slow growth, and establishing a 
framework for sugar industry participation in electricity 
supply may be a way to stimulate the growth of this 
sector. The sugar sector is particularly well-suited to 
support local economic development and job creation 
because a large portion of the jobs would be in 
agriculture. Although the sugar industry provides one 
of the most prominent examples of the contribution 
from biomass and waste products, other industries are 
also poised to benefit from an energy procurement 
framework that covers waste energy recovery (see 
Chapter 3, Section 2 for information on cogeneration 
options under the national IPP programme). Given that 
waste-to-energy projects typically have secondary 
benefits that may not necessarily be reflected in 
electricity costs, a national framework is required for 
the pricing thereof. Secondary benefits include, 
amongst others, avoided use of landfill sites for waste 
disposal (see Chapter 3, Section 5 for a detailed list of 
environmental externalities).Mini-grids for rural locations
Over the last 20 years, South Africa‚Äôs DoE has 
conducted a successful Integrated National 
Electrification Programme (INEP) under which access 
to electrification has increased from 36% in 1994 to 
over 86% in 2017, with more than 5.9¬† million 
households being connected to the grid. Remote rural 
households for which grid-based electricity supply is 
not immediately feasible may provide an opportunity 
for mini-grids that could serve communities with a 
modest number of households. The service offering 
to households may be scaled depending on needs 
that vary from providing basic lighting and charging 
small mobile devices to operating large appliances 
such as televisions and other productive end-uses 
that cater to the specific needs of each community. 
Mini-grid systems are already deployed in South 
Africa where appliances, and the electricity to run 
them, are available to the client at a cost of less than 
ZAR¬†1 (about USD¬†0.07, or seven USD cents) per hour. 
The need lies largely in understanding the best 
business models to allow deployment of mini-grids, 
even in communities that have limited purchasing 
power. Furthermore, the planning for grid expansion, 
off-grid interventions and mini-grids needs to be 
better co-ordinated and integrated.38
38 IRENA has published a range of reports on mini-grids that 
provide further technical information and international 
experiences on these aspects (e.g. see IRENA, 2018e). 
All IRENA reports are available for download from the IRENA 
website, www.irena.org. 
Opportunities for sector coupling
Sector coupling is defined as the process of 
interconnecting the power sector with the broader 
energy sector (e.g. heat, gas, mobility) (IRENA, 
2018d). Several possibilities are emerging to use 
electricity as a primary energy source for the entire 
energy system, including in South Africa. As 
penetration of EVs continues to grow and freight or 
public passenger transport shifts from road to rail, the 
national energy system becomes increasingly 
dependent on electricity, thereby opening a way to 
use renewables for an increasing number of energyrelated services, including transportation and heating.
The use of renewable energy instead of fossil fuels 
increases the overall efficiency of the national energy 
system as ICEs and thermal-based power are 
increasingly eliminated from the transportation and 
generation sectors, respectively. Using electricity for 
heating and cooling load, and combining this with 
energy storage, may also provide flexible demand to 
assist in managing the variable power output from 
solar and wind resources. As end-use sectors are 
increasingly using electricity, the prospects for further 
decarbonisation of the economy also grow. Coupling 
energy sectors in this way will require a significant 
investment in new infrastructure¬† ‚Äì¬† such as charging 
stations for electric mobility¬†‚Äì¬†as well as strengthened 
grids, especially at the distribution level. 8.2 Current challenges 
and opportunities in 
the buildings sector
Challenges in the buildings sector
Electricity supply (solar PV deployment)
The residential sector is already starting to show signs 
of a ramp-up in installations for small-scale embedded 
solar PV where installations are typically sized up to 
5¬† kilowatt peak. Particular attention is given to solar 
PV, considering its suitability for use in this sector 
compared with other renewable energy technologies 
such as wind. In terms of the potential for further 
deployment (as identified in Chapter 7), several 
challenges still exist despite the favourable economics 
for embedded solar PV and other embedded 
technologies. These are presented and discussed in 
the following sections.
Lack of standards for quality certification
of solar PV modules
Technical standards play a vital role in promoting 
safety and the quality of power. Using a common 
standard also allows a meaningful comparison of the 
performance of different PV modules. Most of the 
technical requirements for grid connection of 
embedded generation are covered in the NRS097 
series of standards, and Part 2 of this series 
(NRS097-‚Ää2) deals specifically with SSEG. The 
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 
stipulates 19 tests to establish the quality of PV 
modules, with reference to the Standard IEC 61215-2 
(IEC, 2016). South Africa has yet to develop and 
enforce such a comprehensive set of tests to ensure 
that all panels sold or used in South Africa adhere to a 
set minimum quality standard. This may hamper 
national deployment of solar PV. 
Lack of universal standard for gridtied
small-scale embedded solar PV
Eskom and many of South Africa‚Äôs municipalities are 
licensed to own and operate distribution networks. 
So, an embedded generator can connect either to an 
Eskom or municipal distribution network. Eskom does 
not allow connection of an embedded generator to 
any part of its low-voltage grid infrastructure. There 
is, however, a provision to allow connection of 
embedded generators on medium-voltage sections of 
the grid. Some municipalities allow embedded 
generators to connect to their distribution grids while 
others prohibit such connections. For the 
municipalities that allow connections, the rules, bylaws and procedures for connection are not uniform. 
For instance, some municipalities do not permit 
excess generation to be fed into their network. 
Lack of a clear regulatory framework for
the country
According to the Electricity Regulation Act of 2006, 
all generation of electricity requires a licence from 
NERSA. However, in 2011, NERSA prepared and 
issued regulations governing standard conditions for 
small-scale (less than 100kW) embedded generators 
in municipal boundaries (NERSA, 2011). Under these 
regulations, an embedded generator does not require 
a license to operate. Procurement of small-scale 
(1‚Äì5 MW) and large-scale (greater than 5 MW) 
projects is provided through the REIPPPP. However, 
the REIPPPP regulatory framework does not provide 
for projects of less than 1 MW in capacity. Hence, 
until recently, there was a gap in regulation of smallscale projects falling in the range between 100¬† kW 
and 1 MW in municipalities. In November 2017, this 
gap was addressed by an amendment to Schedule 2 
of the Electricity Regulation Act. However, the 
suitability of this amendment is yet to be determined 
through observing developments in the SSEG sector.Lack of asset financing products for
embedded solar PV
Electricity supply from municipalities and Eskom has 
become more expensive after the tariff increases of 
over 300% during the last 10‚Äì15 years, thereby 
contributing to an increase in the demand for rooftop 
PV systems. This increase in demand for rooftop PV 
systems is a great opportunity for Energy Service 
Companies (ESCOs). The volume of the national ESCO 
PV market has been estimated at ZAR 75 billion 
(about USD¬† 5.4¬† billion) by 2035 (GreenCape, 2018). 
Given the ESCO market growth, commercial finance 
institutions potentially have a viable market that will 
require specific solutions for financing residential, 
commercial and industrial small-scale embedded solar 
PV. Banks such as Nedbank and Amalgamated Banks 
of South Africa have already started offering such 
solutions for their industrial business customers. 
However, many potential customers (especially 
residential) so far cannot afford to meet the cost of 
acquisition and installation of a solar PV system.
Opportunities in the buildings sector
Opportunities that have been highlighted for further 
deployment of renewables in the residential sector in 
South Africa include solar water heating, passive solar 
designs for space heating, stand-alone solar kits for 
dwellings and the use of biogas digesters for energy 
supply in rural residential areas. 
Solar water heating and its value as a demand-side 
management tool 
Peak demand for electricity in South Africa is 
generally observed in the morning and evening, with 
electric cooking and water heating being the major 
contributors to these peaks. Eskom has to run gas 
turbines (for peak periods) to meet the demand. 
These turbines are driven by diesel fuel and have a 
high operational cost and carbon footprint. 
A solar water heater harnesses solar radiation to heat 
water that is stored in a tank for later use, at night or 
during periods of low or no sunshine. The tank is 
properly insulated to curtail heat loss to the ambient 
environment. Consequently, this technology provides 
dispatchable thermal energy. Therefore, solar water 
heating provides an excellent opportunity to absorb 
part of the demand for electricity (which is 
predominantly produced from thermal power plants 
driven by fossil fuels) and for reducing carbon 
emissions. In view of this, there are initiatives to 
promote solar water heating. The DoE has set targets 
for SWH installations (see Chapter 4, Section 3 of this 
study), and SWHs provide a technology option for 
increased renewables use in buildings by 2030 (see 
Chapter 7 of this study). 
Passive solar designs for space heating
As reported in Chapter 4, Section 1, South Africa has 
comprehensive national standards on green buildings. 
The regulations came into effect in 2011 and are meant 
for new buildings. Furthermore, the hope is that, where 
feasible, the regulations can be taken into consideration 
during the maintenance of old buildings. The regulations 
take into account passive building design. 
Passive solar design aims to exploit solar energy to 
assist in establishing thermal comfort in buildings 
without the use of electrical or mechanical equipment 
(Stevanoviƒá, 2013). For example, suitable orientation 
and fenestration allow transmission of adequate solar 
radiation into the building, where it is converted to 
heat when incident on surfaces in the building (such 
as the floor, walls and furniture). The heat gain from 
solar radiation helps reduce the heating load. 
Opportunities do exist for the integration of passive 
solar design strategies at the conceptual design level. 
This can be done by determining values of variables 
that have significant influence on the performance of 
the building. Some of the variables include the building shape, 
opaque components of the building (such as walls), 
glazing and shading. The SANS 10400-XA stipulates, 
amongst others, requirements for orientation, floors, 
external walls, fenestration and roof assemblies. 
Consequently, these regulations (which promote and 
incorporate passive solar design elements) provide an 
opportunity for the development of more energyefficient buildings.
Stand-alone solar kits for dwellings
The main barrier to achieving ‚Äúuniversal access‚Äù to 
electricity in South Africa is the cost of providing 
electricity to remote rural households and the 
challenge of providing electricity to predominantly 
informal or unplanned settlements. For rural areas 
where the population is sparse, an alternative is the 
development of mini-grids which, unlike solar home 
systems, help to stimulate economic growth and 
productivity (Comello et al., 2017). With mini-grids, 
capital equipment can be deployed for value addition 
to products and services such as agro-processing and 
other small-scale industries. (See, for example, IRENA 
[2018e] for further information on mini-grids.) 
Recently, tariffs of grid electricity supplied by Eskom 
and municipalities have been rising, and load 
shedding has occasionally been implemented to meet 
the demand for electricity in suburbs. At the same 
time, the cost of producing electricity from solar PV 
technology has been declining. Consequently, this 
provides an opportunity for consumers in these areas 
to adopt stand-alone solar PV kits if municipalities can 
develop a suitable policy for this kind of business. 
Use of biogas digesters for energy supply in rural 
residential areas
One way of converting waste to energy is via the 
production of biogas by using biogas digesters. The 
biogas can be used directly (such as for cooking/
heating) or indirectly (through generation of 
electricity). About 700 biogas digesters have been 
installed in South Africa (Mutungwazi, Mukumba, and 
Makaka, 2018). The most common are small-scale 
installations for direct usage of the biogas in 
households or small facilities. This category of biogas 
digesters can be used in cookingheating and lighting 
Coincidentally, most of the biogas operations are in 
rural areas of South Africa, which indicates the 
opportunity for exploitation of biogas in rural 
residential areas. 
8.3 Current challenges 
and opportunities in 
the transport sector
South Africa‚Äôs transport sector is still dominated by 
liquid fuels from an energy supply perspective. The 
following sections mainly discuss challenges to the 
introduction of higher shares of biofuels from the 
perspectives of liquid biofuels (which may be blended 
with petroleum) and biogas (which may be used in 
hybrid buses that are already in use in certain 
municipalities), as well as hybrid or fully electric 
modes of public transport (buses, public vehicles), 
fuel-cell vehicles (hydrogen), and increased market 
penetration of electric cars. This section complements 
the technology options identified in Chapter 7.
Hybrid or fully electric modes of public transport
The rate of adoption of EVs in South Africa is relatively 
low. Two possible reasons for this are: i)¬† a lack of 
incentives such as tax rebates and subsidies to 
encourage use of EVs; and ii)¬† the absence of political 
will to extensively promote the exploitation of EVs. 
Another major challenge is the limited number of 
stations where EV operators or owners can charge their 
vehicles. The consequence of this is that conventional 
vehicles continue to dominate the national market.
There is a need to address the lack of infrastructure for 
EVs and to provide other support for market uptake. 
While some EV models are available on the national 
market, hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) buses are 
currently more expensive to purchase than conventional 
diesel buses or buses that run on natural gas. A more 
detailed analysis is required to establish the economics 
of hybridising buses in South Africa. Furthermore, there 
should be a comparative analysis between ICE vehicles 
and EVs as well as between ‚Äúfull‚Äù EVs and hybrid EVs in 
terms of costs (including at purchase and over the 
lifetime of these vehicles). (See, for example, IRENA 
[2017] for a further overview on EVs.)Use of biofuels for blending into the mainstream 
supply of petroleum fuels
South Africa has a regulatory framework for the 
development of the local biofuels industry (see 
Chapter 4). Besides water availability and competing 
land uses, one particular challenge is that, under the 
current fuel market structure and incentive levels, 
biofuels are more expensive than petroleum fuels. 
Hence, at present, biofuels cannot compete on the 
market without policy or financial support 
mechanisms. As a result, projects for the production 
of biofuels are not yet economically feasible on their 
own without some form of support (DoE, 2017c).
The government of South Africa has put in place 
some incentives, including a Biofuels Pricing 
Mechanism (biodiesel manufacturers receive a 50% 
rebate on the general fuel levy), and an Accelerated 
Depreciation Allowance (all renewable energy projects 
qualify for this allowance of 50:30:20 over a period of 
three years) (DoE, 2017c). There is a need to further 
strengthen the regulatory and policy landscape for 
support of the biofuels industry. The lack of economic 
feasibility for biofuel projects adversely affects the 
exploitation of biofuels in transportation and other 
potential use sectors.
Hybrid or fully electric modes of public transport
At present, at the level of individual consumers, 
particularly in the residential sector, there is no 
proper match between daily profiles of demand and 
supply of electricity from renewable sources in South 
Africa, resulting in excess electricity supply during 
certain times of the day. In view of this, the national 
utility Eskom has to store excess electricity during off 
peak times (mostly through pumped storage). Use of 
EVs can reduce (or even eliminate) the need for 
storage by adding to system flexibility. Particularly, 
in the case of power supply shortages during certain 
day times, EVs can assist in meeting peak demands 
by feeding the electricity stored in the EVs‚Äô batteries 
into the central grid. 
8.4 Current challenges 
and opportunities in 
the industrial sector
Challenges in the industrial sector
The industrial sector hosts many industries that are 
major employers in the South African economy. For the 
transition to an energy system based on renewables, 
many stakeholders point out the need to ensure that 
large-scale job losses do not occur as coal mining 
becomes less of a central pillar in the energy landscape 
of the country. Given the scale and role of the coal 
mining sector in the country and the very high 
unemployment in South Africa, this is not only a matter 
of jobs but a wider social issue, since many communities 
and families stand to be affected if the energy transition 
is not managed carefully. This will require well-defined 
social plans and processes to ensure any transition into 
new industries in the future is well managed. Also, 
mining is a highly specialised trade and essential to the 
South African economy. How well such skills can be 
adapted to other sectors remains to be seen. The 
requirements for a just transition of the energy system 
are further outlined in Chapter 7, Section 3.
Energy consumption profile in the industrial sector
Industrial operations typically need a constant energy 
supply and hence do not exhibit peak daily 
consumption periods as is seen in the residential or 
commercial sectors. As a result, the industrial sector 
needs more careful consideration when integrating 
renewable energy into its operations. Supply 
interruptions are particularly harmful for industrial 
production processes that run on a continuous basis. 
Hence, each industrial company needs to assess how 
renewable energies are able to make a contribution to 
their specific industrial process given the temporal load 
profile as well as the form of energy required for the 
industrial process (i.e. electricity, heat or cooling).Co-location with renewable energy primary 
resource
The falling costs of renewable energy in South Africa 
are well documented, particularly in terms of the prices 
seen under the REIPPPP. An important ingredient for 
achieving low costs is the location of renewable energy 
projects; they must be located in areas with very good 
primary resource (e.g. solar irradiation, wind speeds, 
biomass, etc). However, the major industrial areas in 
South Africa (i.e. in Gauteng and the South East Coast 
Durban area) are generally outside the locations with 
the best solar and wind resources (i.e. Northern Cape 
and Eastern Cape provinces). Over the short term, this 
may delay the deployment of renewables because the 
LCOE levels that may be reached in these locations are 
not as favourable as those offered by the best 
renewable energy sites in the country. This barrier is, 
however, expected to be temporary as costs for 
renewables keep decreasing while tariffs for 
conventional electricity supplies continue to rise. If 
these overall cost trends continue, renewable energy 
will certainly offer more favourable energy supply costs 
in time, even outside locations that have the best 
primary energy resources in the country.
Financial assessment of renewables as an 
investment 
Energy supply through renewable energy carriers 
requires substantial investment, and this is particularly 
true in terms of electricity generation. The long-term 
PPAs that allow for investments to be recouped over 
many years are a key component of successful 
renewable energy projects. Within an industrial 
operation or company, potential investments in 
renewable energy supply are assessed in comparison 
to other capital projects. Such ‚Äúprojects‚Äù may include 
upgrades or refurbishments. These competing 
investment options are often assessed with a view to 
achieving the shortest possible payback period. As a 
result, renewable energy supply often does not 
emerge as the most attractive investment option. This 
is steadily changing, however, as energy costs 
continue to increase and become a larger share of the 
overall costs in industrial sector companies. 
Therefore, renewable energy supply needs to be seen 
as a long-term investment in the framework of the 
overall financial sustainability of the company, rather 
than a short-to-medium term investment.
Opportunities in the industrial sector
One of South Africa‚Äôs unique competencies is in the 
chemicals and liquid fuels industries. With very 
competitive renewable energy tariffs and a strong 
chemicals sector, South Africa is in an opportune 
position to develop a domestic Power-to-X sector. 
Power-to-X turns surplus electricity into hydrogen, 
chemicals, heat and other useful products. This 
would be particularly useful as penetration of 
renewable energy increases, and there is a higher 
chance of surplus generation from renewables. With 
cheap surplus renewables-based electricity, South 
Africa can use electrolysis to split water into 
hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen can then be 
used in fuel cells, gas turbines or engines, as well as 
being a feedstock in synthetic gas. Such products 
can be exported to other markets and contribute to 
the targets for climate change mitigation, especially 
in terms of liquid fuels.
Energy efficiency for energy-intensive processes
The national industry is very energy-intensive. The 
Energy Intensive User Group of South Africa 
comprises only 28 companies, but these account for 
about 40% of all electricity consumption in the country 
(and 20% of national GDP) (EUIG, 2019). Energy 
efficiency is a major opportunity for making quick 
inroads for a more sustainable energy sector in the 
country. Although there is a national strategy for 
energy efficiency and initiatives already underway in 
South Africa to address industrial energy efficiency 
(e.g. through the National Cleaner Production Centre), 
there is still a lot of scope for expanding the 
programmes and thereby to realise significant savings 
from energy efficiency measures. Renewables for low-temperature heat supply
Much of the energy demand in South Africa‚Äôs 
industrial sector is in the form of process heat. Solar 
irradiation can be harnessed through relatively simple 
technologies such as evacuated tube collector and flat 
plate collector solar water heaters. A comprehensive 
approach for deploying renewables for lowtemperature heat would require a mapping of heat 
demand for the entire country. Once this is completed, 
electricity for heating purposes may be replaced by 
water heating where low-temperature heat is 
required.
New manufacturing opportunities
Several manufacturing plants have been established 
in South Africa since the launch of the REIPPPP. These 
facilities built upon the strong manufacturing 
capabilities found in South Africa and created new 
competencies. Examples of this include manufacturing 
of wind towers, inverters, solar panels, tracking 
systems for solar PV and mounting structures. Delays 
in the most recent rounds of the REIPPPP have 
harmed some of these operations, but the skills and 
competence in the country remain. 
With the increasing deployment of renewables in 
South Africa and in the overall SADC region, these 
national manufacturing industries could also be 
strengthened and expanded. As outlined in Chapter 7, 
Section 3, locating new industries in current coal 
mining regions can facilitate a just transition to 
renewables. 
Technology development
Renewable energy technologies are still showing 
decreasing costs due to technology improvements 
and economies of scale in manufacturing (see 
Chapter¬† 6 for further information). These decreasing 
costs indicate that there is still room for improvement 
in terms of technology development. 
The most pertinent examples for South Africa may 
include battery storage, high-temperature heat 
storage media and systems, new generation biofuels, 
as well as Power-to-X (i.e. using low-cost renewables 
as an energy input to production process for 
chemicals, synthetic fuels, etc). (See Box¬† 5 for an 
overview of some renewable energy technologies 
possibly upcoming in South Africa.) 
The contribution to these developments gives South 
African companies the opportunity to have intellectual 
property and export South African-based innovation 
to other markets. The opportunity to take part in 
innovation and development of these technologies 
may have a limited associated time window because 
once technologies reach full maturity and cost 
reductions become incremental, there is only limited 
scope for further technological improvements that 
South Africa may achieve and commercialise.9 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AN 
ACCELERATED ENERGY TRANSITION 
IN SOUTH AFRICA 
South Africa has vast potential for renewable energy 
deployment and energy efficiency, including in enduse sectors. Chapter 7 identifies the concrete 
technology options that exist in different sectors. To 
realise the available technology options and the 
associated benefits, South Africa needs to address the 
central barriers and challenges faced by the national 
energy sector. The opportunities identified by sector 
in Chapter 8 point to suggested ways to enhance the 
enabling framework and conditions for increased 
renewable energy and energy efficiency. This chapter 
translates the analysis into a set of concrete 
recommendations for the national energy transition, 
along the following seven central themes: 
‚óè Realign the national energy sector structure. 
‚óè Enhance investments in national power sector 
infrastructure.
‚óè Clarify and simplify the regulatory environment 
(particularly for SSEG) and ensure consistent 
implementation of polices.
‚óè Support targeted research and development on 
innovative renewable energy (enabling) 
technologies, undertake research on a just 
transition for the energy sector and devise 
corresponding measures.
‚óè Increase sector coupling to exploit opportunities 
for renewables-based power to underpin other 
end-use demand sectors such as transportation 
and industry.
‚óè Widen the use of private-public partnerships in the 
deployment of renewable energy.
‚óè Fully realise the potential of embedded generation.
The specific recommendations under these seven 
central themes are further explained in the following 
sections.
9.1 Realignment of the national 
energy sector structure
The energy sector structure in South Africa has 
served the country well for several decades. Over 
recent years, renewable energy has become 
increasingly cost-competitive, particularly as a 
distributed small-scale solution. This development has 
challenged the suitability of the current energy sector 
structure. In light of this, certain restructuring options 
for the national energy sector should be investigated 
and selected for implementation.39
They may include an institutional realignment to adapt 
to a power sector with higher shares of variable 
renewables. The realignment needs to enable the 
application of new business models and maintain the 
financial sustainability of the institutions facing 
emerging trends such as: 
‚óè generation for self-consumption (i.e. prosumers)
‚óè increase embedded generation, with a targeted 
focus on improving energy access (especially, at a 
small scale)
‚óè energy trading 
‚óè digitisation
‚óè increased flexibility of power systems, including 
increased ramping of large fossil plants, improved 
renewable resource forecasts, demand response 
and storage technologies (e.g. battery storage)
‚óè demand for a range of new and more diverse 
energy-related municipal services (rather than just 
on-selling of power from the wholesale market).
39 As outlined in Chapter 3, Box¬†2 of this study, President 
Ramaphosa in February 2019 announced the unbundling of 
Eskom into three separate entities ‚Äì Generation, Transmission 
and Distribution ‚Äì under Eskom Holdings. Since the news 
emerged after the writing of this study, it was not reflected in 
the present findings.9.2 Enhanced investments 
in national power sector 
infrastructure
Over recent years, South Africa repeatedly faced 
periods of load-shedding. The power cuts are 
imposed to prevent a collapse of the national 
electricity grid. Especially national industries that rely 
on stable supplies for maintaining smooth operations 
are negatively affected by rolling outages, which lead 
to reduced output and contribute to suppressed 
economic growth in South Africa. 
The load-shedding is the result of a severe backlog for 
electricity infrastructure maintenance, rehabilitation 
and strengthening. In addition, the new mega coal 
plants are years behind schedule, significantly over 
budget and not properly functioning due to technical 
problems. Eskom is therefore unable to generate 
enough electricity for reliably meeting national 
demand. South Africa needs to considerably increase 
investment in the national power infrastructure to 
address the current backlog and strengthen national 
generation capacity and grids. The effect of such 
investments can be further enhanced through 
realignment of the national energy sector structure 
(see Chapter 9, Section 1).
9.3 Enhanced regulatory process and 
consistent policy implementation 
The energy sector regulatory environment is still 
evolving in South Africa as new technologies and 
generation options influence actors in the market. 
Creating a supportive environment for renewable 
energy needs to include a regulatory regime that is 
simple, clear and easy to understand. This also implies 
that, once policy decisions are taken, there should be 
an effort to minimise retrospective changes to those 
policies in order to create policy stability and 
certainty. 
Key elements to consider within the regulatory 
environment include:
‚óè treatment of embedded generation in jurisdictions 
where grid infrastructure is owned by Eskom, by 
metro municipalities, and by smaller municipalities, 
respectively.
‚óè clarity on how different associated regulatory rules 
relate and link to one another (e.g. rules and 
regulations on embedded generation, wheeling, 
trading, procurement, etc).
‚óè improved communication with energy sector 
actors regarding the progress of regulatory 
processes. 
Certain issues that are inherently complex will require 
lengthy deliberation between multiple government 
departments. In such instances, it is especially 
important to increase transparency and 
communication to maintain the confidence of all 
interested and affected parties.
In addition, South Africa already has a range of 
policies and programmes that are well designed for 
supporting its national objectives. Examples in the 
energy sector include the REIPPPP and the INEP. A 
key element of success, besides formulating good 
policies, lies in ensuring their effective and consistent 
implementation. There are several instances where 
inconsistent implementation has harmed the 
perception around the national energy sector. 
Examples of inconsistency may include:
‚óè delays in procurement programmes where prior 
commitments and timelines are not observed.
‚óè retraction of promulgated policy, regulatory rules 
or instruments.
‚óè the promulgation of policies from different 
government departments where there is poor 
alignment.
‚óè differentiated treatment of sector stakeholders 
under the same policy or regulatory environment.
For a successful national energy transition, such 
instances should be avoided.9.4 Targeted research on innovative 
technologies and key aspects of 
the ‚Äújust transition‚Äù
South Africa should support research and 
development for innovative technologies to be able to 
leapfrog certain technologies and participate in major 
growth markets. This includes renewable energy 
technologies (ocean energy, etc) and renewablesenabling technologies (storage, smart grids, etc). For 
these potential future technology options, further 
work needs to focus on understanding their potential 
and the research and development required to 
achieve maturity and commercialisation. See Box¬†5 of 
this study for a more detailed overview.
However, the gradual transition to an energy sector 
with higher shares of renewable energy does not only 
involve new technologies, market players, and power 
system operations¬†‚Äì¬†it also involves people, jobs and 
communities. The South African energy sector has 
relied on coal and other fossil fuels for decades, and 
this sector provides many jobs. At least part of the 
resistance against renewables seen from some 
stakeholders originates from a concern about the 
impact on jobs in the coal and broader fossil fuels 
sectors ‚Äì concerns that are reasonable in a country 
with very high unemployment. To ensure an inclusive 
and just energy transition and fair prospects for 
renewables, there should be a clear understanding 
and roadmap to outline the implications of such a 
transition as well as how exactly it will be executed. 
Such clarity will require further targeted research on 
the following aspects:
‚óè the impact on jobs in the coal mining sector and 
related sectors (i.e. coal processing, coal 
transportation).
‚óè prospects for re-skilling workers from fossil fuelbased industries and repositioning these people for 
a future in renewables, as well as for establishing 
new clean industries in coal mining regions.
‚óè clarity of the national job creation potential of 
renewable energy projects and along the entire 
renewable energy value chain (see IRENA [2018b] 
for further information).
‚óè understanding how the transition to higher shares of 
renewable energy impacts the developmental path 
of the country, looking not only at renewables as an 
enabler for supply of low-cost energy but also for 
lower pollution, overall environmental protection, and 
improved public health (especially in communities 
around heavy coal mining and power generation; 
see, for example, the Co-Benefits project in South 
Africa described in Chapter 7, Section 3).
‚óè the extent to which renewables can provide 
opportunities for micro and small-scale enterprise 
development.
As outlined in Chapter 7, Section 3, it will be crucial to 
manage an inclusive, gradual process and foster social 
acceptance for the renewable energy transition. For 
this purpose, and to address the above-listed aspects 
in an integrated manner, South Africa could set up a 
national commission to foster a dialogue between key 
role-players and to jointly develop a comprehensive 
coal phase-out plan and associated measures for 
cushioning impacts on workers and communities.
9.5 Sector coupling and end-use 
sector debarbonisation 
Productive end-uses in other sectors are often reliant 
on fossil fuels. The most prominent example is the 
dominance of petroleum-based fuels in transportation. 
Also, in many instances, biomass and fossil fuels are 
used for heating purposes in South Africa. To achieve 
deep carbon emission reductions, the use of 
renewables-based power as a substitute for fossil fuels 
may prove to be a very useful option. 
Technology options for supplying a range of end-uses 
with electricity exist, as outlined in Chapters 7 and 8. 
Besides the transport sector, sector coupling could also 
be done between the power sector and the heating/
cooling sector. For example, instead of curtailing excess 
renewable energy, it may be used for water heating in the 
residential sector and hence substitute some of the fossil 
fuel-based electricity that is used for water heating in 
South Africa¬† ‚Äì¬† particularly in the residential sector. 
Coupling of the power and heating sectors can thereby 
increase the flexibility of the power system (essentially 
creating variable and dispatchable demand) and enhance the ability of the power system to accommodate higher 
shares of variable renewables. Proper analysis of the 
South African power system should be conducted to see 
whether the more valuable option is using renewables 
for water heating (i.e. solar water heating) or coupling 
water heating to power generation such that there is 
flexible demand to accommodate increased deployment 
of variable renewable energy.
9.6 Development of public-private 
partnerships in the energy 
sector
In recent years, South Africa has rolled out major 
infrastructure projects using the public-private 
partnership model. Two of the most prominent 
existing examples of such an approach in South Africa 
are the Gautrain project (the largest public-private 
partnership project in South Africa‚Äôs history) and the 
REIPPPP in which the South Africa Government 
created a procurement programme that attracted 
investment from the private sector. The partnership 
between the public and private sector took place not 
only at the programme level (with government setting 
up the REIPPPP and industry responding to this) but 
also at the project level, where public sector 
investment firms (i.e. IDC, DBSA, PIC, and others) 
took equity shares in projects alongside private sector 
investors. This model proved effective and led to the 
unlocking of over USD¬†15¬†billion in direct investment 
into the renewable energy sector alone. The 
applicability of this model should be explored in other 
areas as well, particularly:
‚óè In a potential programme centred on municipalities 
procuring energy for demand within their 
jurisdiction. Such a programme is currently being 
explored by Ekurhuleni Municipality and, with 
national government backing, other municipalities 
may be able to also explore this possibility.
‚óè Setting up manufacturing facilities where risk is 
shared between both public and private sector 
investment firms. This has been attempted for the 
manufacture of wind turbine towers in the Coega 
Industrial Development Zone where the IDC 
together with DCD Wind Tower entered into a joint 
venture
‚óè Although the results of this joint venture were 
somewhat mixed. This was primarily due to delays 
in the REIPPPP procurement rounds, which led to 
unsteady demand for the production of wind 
towers and affected the profitability of the 
manufacturing facility. 
In principle, however, the use of public-private 
partnerships can allow for optimal risk sharing and for 
the unlocking of investment for further deployment of 
renewables, thereby creating employment at the same 
time.
9.7 Realising the full potential 
of SSEG
In recent years, embedded generation has accelerated 
in South Africa. This development has been more the 
result of market forces and the performance of the 
national utility rather than of active policy support. 
These developments outside of a comprehensive 
government programme are having negative effects on 
all incumbent electricity suppliers (i.e. both the national 
utility and municipalities). These effects include revenue 
losses from decreased electricity sales, grid defections 
and under-recovery of costs for electricity distribution.
To mitigate against these effects and guide the further 
growth of this sector for the benefit of the country, a 
more proactive approach should be adopted. In 
encouraging the further development of embedded 
generation, attention should be given to:
‚óè Potential financial savings due to decreased 
maximum notifiable demand as a result of localised 
generation from solar PV.
‚óè Possibilities for municipalities to diversify their 
offering into energy services supporting small-scale 
installations (and thereby safeguarding their 
financial sustainability). At the same time, 
municipalities and Eskom need to adopt new 
business models to engage in new service offerings.
‚óè Job creation potential and small, medium and 
micro-sized enterprise development with regard to 
installation and maintenance of small-scale 
generation units.REFERENCES
