Solomon Islands Solomon Islands National Energy Policy Framework 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The National Energy Policy Framework sets out the Government's policies for the planning and 
management of the energy sector over the next 10 years. The framework defines the strategies 
that government is taking to ensure that the objectives of the policies are fully realised. In 
developing the energy policy framework government is mindful of the critical role of the energy 
sector in the attainment of its overall socio-economic development goals of improving the 
livelihood of all its peoples. 
Important Policy Considerations for the Solomon Islands 
There are three principal energy policy considerations detailed in the Solomon Islands National 
Energy Policy Framework, namely: 
(i) Supply issues: For the Solomon Islands the provision of adequate, secure, and costeffective energy supplies through the promotion of indigenous energy resources specifically 
renewable energy resources using the least cost options and to diversify the energy 
dependence among several types of sources and suppliers are critical. Diversifying the supply 
sources will also mean the Solomon Islands developing strategic partnerships locally and 
abroad. 
(ii) Utilisation issues: The efficient utilization of energy and to discourage wasteful and nonproductive patterns of energy consumption is vital for a country that is so dependent on 
imported energy sources. 
(iii) Environmental issues: Like most Pacific Island countries the Solomon Islands have a 
fragile environment and government always places environmental issues high on its agenda. 
Therefore it is important that the energy policies are targeted at minimising the negative impacts 
of energy production, transportation, conversion, utilisation and consumption on the 
environment. 
This policy framework provides details of how the government of the Solomon Islands can 
effectively address the three critical considerations highlighted above. Along this line the policy 
framework has identified twelve strategic areas on which appropriate policies are formulated.

B. Petroleum Sector 
C. Transport Sector 
D. Electricity Sector - Urban 
E. Electricity Sector - Rural

J. Legislation and Regulations K. Financing 
L. Gender 
2. BACKGROUND 
A. Energy Sector Planning, Coordination and Management 
This strategic area covers the institutional aspects of energy sector planning and management. 
It is important that a well defined institutional structure is in place to coordinate energy sector 
planning and management. The role of the coordinating unit/organisation cannot be over 
emphasized given that energy cuts across all other sector development programmes. It is 
important appropriate level of well-trained staff are in posts to ensure that institutional capacity 
commensurate with expected function of the planning unit. In addition, resources such as 
funding, office space and equipment, tools and equipment for implementing projects, vehicles, 
computers, etc are vital to the execution and accomplishment of the institutional functions. 
B. Petroleum Sector 
The SI is heavily dependent on petroleum fuels to sustain its economy. It is only prudent for the 
Government to put in place appropriate policy statements that are able to cushion the negative 
impacts of escalating fuel prices. With an unlikely falling in fuel price to the 1990’s price 
foreseen to happen immediately, practical and stringent measures by way of policies must be 
put in place to prevent further damage to the economy. 
The provision of a secure, reliable and affordable fuel supply to both urban and rural areas is of 
paramount importance. Storage facilities and fuel supply infrastructure in the SI require 
stringent adherence to international and national safety standards. Fuel quality is also of 
importance and the development of national fuel standard is fundamental to an efficient and 
sustainable petroleum sector. 
C. Transport Sector 
The transport sector in the context of this policy framework constitutes land and sea modes of 
transportation. In the SI the transport sector is the biggest consumer for imported petroleum 
fuels. Measures will have to be devised to ensure that the transport sector functions efficiently. 
To reduce imported fuel consumption in the transport sector, research in alternative sources of 
fuel will have to be promoted. The importation of efficient vehicles into the country will need to 
be regulated and this will call for the revision of existing regulations and enactment of new ones. 
 
D. Electricity Sector - Urban 
The supply of electricity in the urban areas is the sole responsibility of the Solomon Islands 
Electricity Authority (SIEA). SIEA is a government statutory authority established under an Act 
of parliament and as such it is influenced by decisions directed by Government with regards its 
operation. It also has some commercial influence by virtue of its status (statutory authority). SIEA has a mix of generating plants – thermal and hydro. SIEA’s operation was badly affected 
by the ethnic tensions of the early 2000. State of the power infrastructure has deteriorated over 
the years that needed rehabilitation. SIEA had also run into financial difficulties due to nonpayment of electricity bills from its large power consumers and management limitation. This in a 
lot of ways affected SIEA’s ability to supply power to Honiara on a continuous and reliable basis. 
With assistance from strategic partners such as AUSAid and the Japanese Government, SIEA 
has been able to come out of its predicament to improve the power situation in Honiara through 
increased generation capacity, improved operational efficiency through a regular scheduled 
maintenance programme, upgraded distribution system and improved billing system. Training 
has been provided through the Japanese Government to enhance the skill levels of SIEA 
Engineers in both technical and management areas. 
This improvement in operational efficiency and capacity building will enhance SIEA’s capability 
to perform its functions effectively. 
 
SIEA also has the responsibility of operating and managing some outer islands power supply 
systems. These are mainly provincial centres whose power demand is usually negligible forcing 
most of the systems to operate intermittently. 
The restructuring of the urban power sector to allow Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and 
encouraging competition in the delivery of power services is a prudent policy measure. 
 E. Electricity Sector - Rural 
The provision of electricity into the rural areas is seen as a high priority in the SI. Majority of the 
population live in the rural areas and access to electricity is below 20%. Generally, rural areas 
have always been neglected in terms of development. Infrastructure development to provide 
improved health, education, communication and transportation facilities and services are 
lacking. In certain remote areas, the facilities and services are non-existent. 
It is envisaged that the policy statements highlighted here will compliment the Rural 
Electrification Framework currently being developed in conjunction with the review of the 
existing Electricity Act. 
Policy measures encouraging the involvement of private investors and development of strategic 
partnerships with NGOs and donors will accelerate the provision of electricity into the rural 
areas. 
F. Renewable Energy 
Renewable energy is a fast growing industry worldwide. There are several characteristics that 
favour renewable energy over the traditional energy sources. The fact that it is renewable offers 
a guarantee that it will always be present and will never run out. It is a clean source of energy 
and does not emit any global warming gas. The technology used in harnessing the renewable 
energy source is easy to operate and maintain. The cost associated with operating a 
renewable energy project is only a fraction of the cost of operating a conventional energy 
technology such as a diesel generator used in a similar situation and application. Solar PV is 
used widely in the Pacific and there is capacity to handle design, installation, repairs and maintenance work in the Solomon Islands. Solomon Islands has great hydro-power potential 
resource (roughly 200-300MW in total) and needs careful planning to harness this source of 
energy to ensure its sustainability as a renewable energy source that the country can rely on. 
There is potential for harnessing of biomass (bio-fuel) also but the country needs to quantify the 
available energy we can tap from this resource. There are geothermal energy sources in some 
parts of the country. Investigations into how much wind energy potential the country has 
especially on parts of the country that are located further away from the equator need to be 
assessed to ascertain how wind energy could be utilized. 
G. Environment 
With more and more emphasis on the preservation of the environment, it is important that 
energy programmes are designed in such a way that they do not contribute further to the 
degradation of the environment. Energy sources especially fossil fuel based sources have 
been linked closely with the greenhouse gas emissions that are supposedly causing global 
warming and extreme changing weather patterns. It is therefore imperative for the Government 
to put in place energy policies that avoid any adverse impact on the fragile environment. 
H. Energy Conservation and Efficiency 
The efficient use of energy is the most important step to improve the environment and contribute 
to sustainable economic health. Energy efficiency links closely with environmental quality and 
economic vitality. Greater energy efficiency can reduce energy costs to consumers, enhance 
environmental quality, maintain and enhance the standard of living, increase energy security 
and promote a strong economy. It is therefore imperative that energy policies are put in place 
to assist in the efficiency with which we use energy in the generation and use of electricity, in 
our residences and offices, in the manufacturing sector and also in the transportation sector. 
I Capacity Building and Information 
Energy issues are always taken for granted in the SI. This is evident from the lack of emphasis 
and allocation of resources towards energy sector development in the development plans of 
past governments. In certain respects, this lack of commitment from governments contributes 
to the lethargy of the general population on energy issues. 
The critical role energy plays in enhancing socio-economic growths highlights the importance of 
ensuring that the general population has a fair understanding of the energy issues affecting their 
livelihoods. This will require the collection and dissemination of information at levels of society. 
The introduction of energy programmes in the schools’ curriculum (from primary to tertiary and 
technical institutions) will go a long way in facilitating understanding of energy issues in the SI. 
The links between energy use and production to issues such as global warming and sea level 
rise makes it more urgent to put in place mechanisms that help build the capacity in the SI to put 
in place mitigating measures that do not comprise the quality of services needed. 
Developing the skills and knowledge in energy planning and energy management in the SI is 
critical. This is an area where the public and private sectors both play key roles. While the 
public sector provides the enabling environment and regulatory framework, the private sector 
provides the much needed investment capital to promote energy sector development. J. Legislation and Regulations 
There are existing legislations that drive energy sector development in the SI and some are 
seen to be inhibitive and require updating and or overhauling. Energy legislations appear to be 
focused on the two major areas of power sector and petroleum sector. These two traditional 
energy sub-sectors have been dominating the energy sector with the latter being the primary 
source of energy that fuels economic growth in the SI. The transport sector is considered an 
important energy sub-sector because it is a major user of imported petroleum fuels. 
Legislations for the transport sector are deficient in energy use considerations. For example, 
the absence of energy efficiency and conservation measures from existing legislations might 
have contributed to the proliferation of inefficient and unnecessarily large privately owned 
vehicles. There is a need to review the existing legislations and their mechanisms to be 
consistent with the energy policy framework. 
K. Financing 
The lack of funding resources allocated to energy sector development over the past years has 
been a major barrier to realising the potential for this dynamic tool of development in the SI. 
Relying solely on public expenditure will put a strain on domestic public finances. Moreover, the 
public sector alone tends not to have the capacity to deliver large-scale infrastructure projects 
and meet quality standards in terms of service provision. It is therefore crucial that other sources 
of finance are mobilised. Private funding is an effective way of meeting this objective. It is 
therefore crucial that the policy framework ensures that the right financial and legal framework is 
in place to facilitate private investments in the energy sector. 
L. Gender 
Energy and gender issues are frequently being discussed and highlighted at international fora. 
Gender issues are linked closely to poverty and it has been recognised that addressing gender 
issues is a prerequisite to achieving sustainable development. Promoting gender issues is in 
keeping with international conventions and agreements. It has the noble goal of improving the 
livelihood of the disadvantaged groups with special reference to women issues. In the Solomon 
Islands energy and gender issues are not really well understood at all level of decision-making. 
In many instances this is due to cultural bias against women and outdated laws that restrict the 
active participation of women in decision-making or having independent access to control of 
income and ownership of property. The policy framework will ensure that the provision of 
energy services in the SI takes into consideration energy issues that affect the livelihood of 
women and other disadvantaged groups. 3. STRATEGIC PLAN
