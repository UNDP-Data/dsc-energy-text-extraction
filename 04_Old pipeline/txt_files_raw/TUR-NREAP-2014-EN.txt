NATIONAL RENEWABLE
ENERGY STRATEGY1.1 Rationale
Turkey is a candidate country to join the European Union, 
working diligently on the actions towards building a 
strong, clear and direct path toward complying with the 
EU acquis and its requirements. Energy is one of the most 
critical chapters in the EU acquis. ‘The Renewable Energy 
Directive’, Directive 2009/28/EC (1) on the Promotion 
of the Use of Energy from Renewable Sources calls on 
every Member State to draw up and promote a National 
Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) for the period 
of 2011-20201
 to present to the European Commission 
(EC) by June 30, 2010 with a view to complying with the 
binding targets stated within the Directive.
As the Directive indicates, NREAP is expected to conform 
to the national action plan template adopted by the 
European Commission via the June 30, 2009 Commission 
Decision establishing a template for the National Renewable Energy Action Plans under Directive 2009/28/EC of 
the European Parliament and of the Council. Turkey, as a 
candidate country, has prepared this action plan as a manifestation of its commitment to those renewable energy 
targets and EU accession.
Turkey is the 17th largest economy in the world and the 6th
largest in Europe. With a growing economy and population, energy demand in Turkey has steeply risen, which has 
ranked security of supply at the top of the government’s 
agenda, both for electricity and for other primary energy 
sources. The Turkish economy is heavily dependent on 
imported energy supplies, and its primary energy consumption is mainly based on fossil fuels, which was approximately 90% in 2012 where majority of this supply was 
imported from other countries. In the upcoming years, it is 
forecasted that Turkey will continue with the major economic development, which will require an increase in the 
demand of energy supply. 
According to current estimates, an increase of around 
90% in primary energy demand will take place during the 
period of 2011-2023. Aside from investments for the creation of new capacity within the field, the source of energy 
(for instance, the need for local and renewable sources) 
and maximizing energy efficiency are also critical points 
for Turkey. In order to both avoid the risks linked to a high 
level of energy dependency and to develop a sustainable 
energy model, the Government is committed to promoting alternative solutions based mainly in renewable 
energy. Therefore, Turkey has initiated a forward-looking 
and innovative energy policy in which renewable energy 
plays a significant role.
1. For Turkey, rather than the year 2020, the year 2023 is taken as the 
On one hand, by 2023 Turkey plans to have an electricity 
generation mix in which the share of renewable energy 
accounts for 30% of overall need, as well as, having 10% 
of the requirements of the transportation sector met by 
renewable energy. On the other hand, there is also a commitment to reduce by at least 20% (with reference to 2011 
figures) the amount of energy consumed per unit GDP in 
the year 2023 (in terms of energy intensity).
The Government has established very ambitious objectives for 2023 regarding electricity generation based on 
the high availability of renewable energy resources: hydro, 
wind, solar irradiation, geothermal, etc., which would 
increase the share of renewable energy in electricity generation to at least 30% and 127.3 TWh in 2023.
For many years, hydroelectric power plants, the use of 
biomass for heating purposes and use of geothermal 
were the major contributors in terms of renewable 
energy resources to the Turkish energy mix. During 
recent years, other technologies such as geothermal 
and wind energy have begun to make an impact on the 
Turkish energy sector. 
As demonstrated in Figure 3, in 2013, the renewable 
energy share in electricity production was 29% of the total 
production and 40% of the installed capacity

0Figure 4 depicts the share of different renewable energy 
sources in Turkey. In 2012, the total energy produced based 
on renewable sources reached 12.1 million toe, or approximately 10% of Turkey’s total primary energy consumption.
Today, the development of renewable energy sources and 
the promotion of energy efficiency measures are two of the 
priorities of Turkish energy policy, supporting a sustainable 
industrial development under environmental considerations. The best proof of this is the present REAP and the future National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP). The latter 
document will be developed by the Turkish Government in 
collaboration with EBRD in the coming months. The main 
objectives of this policy are and will be the security of supply 
d iibiliiid il 
It is also important to note that primary energy consumption in Turkey reached 121 Mtoe in 2012, where 82% of the 
total figure was from imports. In addition, the energy intensity (unit of energy consumed to generated unit GDP) 
in the country was 0.27 toe per USD 1,000 of GDP and is 
higher than in the rest of major EU countries. 
However, international economic institutions forecast 
high economic growth rates for the next several years, and 
energy consumption is expected to increase to 218 Mtoe 
by 2023 (or a 91.2% increase from 2011 to 2023). These 
figures give an idea of the important role of energy in Turkey over the next decade. It is critical that the demand will 
not be a bottleneck for economic development.
Therefore, the Turkish energy policy2
 has being articulated 
ensuring the following basic values and principles: 
• Transparency: operations conducted in a manner 
that is open and accessible to all parties concerned, 
along with informing and soliciting the opinion of the 
public about the framework of the laws.
• Reliability: operations conducted so that the policy 
and policymakers are both reliable and reputable on a 
national and international scale.
• Innovation and Pioneering: the encouragement of 
R&D activities and pioneering the use of new technologies. 
• Cooperation: operations are conducted by recruiting 
the participation of relevant parties and with the aim of 
providing services in line with needs and expectations. 
• Efficiency: overseeing the utilization of public resources allocated to the Ministry of Energy and Resources for 
the purpose of ensuring efficiency and effectiveness.
• Coherency: operations are conducted with a view 
toward medium and long term goals and according to the 
global developments in line with Turkey’s overall interests.
The National Renewable Energy Action Plan (REAP) for 
Turkey has been created in alignment with Directive 
2009/28/EC and the template predetermined by the European Commission Decision of 30.06.2009 (2009/548/EC).

1.2 Summary of the national policy on energy from 
renewable energy sources
Several factors such as population growth, increasing 
energy demand, concerns over energy security supply 
and climate change have evoked a new era for renewable 
energy technologies worldwide.
Considering the fact that Turkey is rich in renewable 
energy resources together with the aim of diversifying 
energy supply, the maximum level for domestic, renewable resources in the production of electricity has been 
targeted within the framework of the national energy 
policy. Turkey, being the 17th largest economy in the 
world and 6th largest in Europe, is experiencing a steep 
increase in its demand for energy. Therefore, Turkey has 
initiated a forward-looking and innovative energy policy 
in which renewable energy plays a significant role. On 
one hand, by 2023 Turkey plans to have an electricity 
generation mix in which the share of renewable energy 
accounts for 30% of overall need as well as having 10% 
of the requirements of the transportation sector met 
by renewable energy. On the other hand, there is also a 
commitment to reduce by at least 20% (with reference to 
2008 figures) the amount of energy consumed per unit 
GDP in the year 2023 (in terms of energy intensity).
Investments in sustainable energy will continue to move 
forward in Turkey as long as emerging technologies 
appear on the horizon and are supported by sufficient 
incentives. In accordance with the Turkish Energy Efficiency Strategy Paper (4), there are two specific targets 
directly related to the renewable energy sector. One of 
them, Strategic Purpose 2, states the percentage of the 
targeted share for renewable energy resources within 
the energy supply. In the other, Strategic Purpose 7, the 
necessity of minimizing the negative environmental 
impact of the activities within the energy and natural 
resources sectors is highlighted.
Since 2010, the strategies followed by the Turkish Government3
 for increasing the share of renewable energy within 
the energy mix have been:
1. Precautions will be taken for the completion of licensed projects within the projected terms for renewable 
energy resources of economic value.
2. Production planning will be prepared considering 
developments within the renewable energy field, in 
line with advances in technology and the arrangements within current legislation.
3. Precautions will be taken for the maximum utilization of Turkey’s hydroelectric potential, as is economically feasible and for the integration of this potential 
into the national economy through the private sector.
4. Cooperation will increase, in an accelerated rate, 
with studies conducted for the development of water 
resources as economically feasible for electricity generation on the basis of integrated approaches in view of 
meeting changing consumption demands.
5. The criteria for the economic analysis of hydroelectricity plants will be evaluated according to the present 
day standards.
6. Acceleration in the number of studies required for 
the growth of the electricity transmission system that 
would allow for the connection of a higher number 
of intermittent energy technologies such as solar and 
wind energy power plants.
7. The protection of geothermal resources during utilization, including their sustainability in terms of their 
renewal and regeneration.
8. Plans to open up areas for geothermal development, 
where suitable for electricity production, in order to 
accelerate private sector participation.
9. Emphasis will be given to technology development 
studies in the field of renewable energy resources.Regarding the minimization of the negative environmental 
impact of industrial activities, Turkey has joined the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and ratified The Kyoto Protocol on the May 28, 2009. Additionally, the 
Turkish Government has carried out a roster of actions against 
any negative environmental impact since 2010, including: 
• The promotion of the usage of renewable energy 
resources and the effective use of energy and clean coal 
technologies, 
• The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, 
• The utilization of biomass/biogas potential (in infrastructure facilities for water, waste water and solid waste), 
• Increase in the effectiveness of control and supervision 
for compliance with sustainable mining and sustainable 
environmental principles in mining operations, and
• Training and public awareness of climate change and 
environmentally friendly energy technologies.
1.2.1 Current national policy on renewable energy
Progress has been made in the field of renewable energy 
starting from 2005, after the publication of the Law on 
Utilization of Renewable Energy Resources for the Purpose of Generating Electrical Energy (Renewable Energy 
Law, REL, Law No. 5346). Investments in renewable energy 
technologies remained limited between 2005 and 2010 
due to the lack of secondary legislation and relatively low 
feed-in tariff levels. Nevertheless, the Renewable Energy 
Law amendment in December 2010 introduced higher 
feed-in tariff rates for some technologies, and other 
various monetary and non-monetary incentives. Therefore, the penetration of renewable energy technologies 
was accelerated as compared to the period 2005 - 2010. 
After feed-in tariff rates were revised, renewable energy 
investments attracted the attention of both local and 
international investors.

Figure 5a: Evolution of renewable energy regulations and policies in Turkey including the most important energy efficiency regulations
Figure 5 b: Evolution of energy efficiency regulations and policies in TurkeyTurkey’s current national energy regulation is articulated 
in the following laws:
• New Electricity Market Law (Law No. 6446)
This law (6) introduces some important changes in the current 
electricity market system, including amendments to license 
types, framing its provisions around each type of market activity, specific provisions for certain license types (generation, 
transmission, distribution, wholesale, retail, auto-producer and 
auto-producer group), the introduction of a preliminary licensing mechanism and investment incentives, such as extended 
deadlines and grace periods for environmental compliance. In 
reference to the renewable energy sector, it establishes:
- The maximum installed capacity for a renewable energy plant to operate without a license has been raised 
from 500 kW to 1 MW, with the ease of increasing up to 
5 times (5 MW) by a decree of the Council of Ministers 
without a change in the Law. Furthermore, with the new 
Law, there is no limit for renewable energy facilities that 
serve for self-consumption without feeding into the grid.
- Renewable generation facilities that extend over 
more than one premise can be considered one single 
generation entity provided that they are connected to 
the system from the same point.
- The Law reasserts the exemptions and discounts in land 
use rights as described in the Renewable Energy Law.
- The pre-licensing step is defined in the licensing process and all M&A activities at this stage are restricted.
- For wind and solar power plants that would compete for 
the grid access rights, the tendering process has been modified to reduce the 20 year payment period of contribution 
fees to the Transmission System Operator to 3 years. The 
contribution fee that was paid according to generated kWh 
was modified to be paid for unit installed capacity (per MW).
• The Law on the Utilization of Renewable Energy 
Resources for the Purpose of Generating Electrical 
Energy (Law No: 5346)
This is the initial legal framework that regulates Renewable 
Energy Sources for the Purpose of Generating Electrical 
Energy (7). Renewable energy resources were defined as 
non-fossil energy resources such as hydro (less than 15 km2
of reservoir area and run-of-the-river hydroelectric), wind, 
solar, geothermal, biomass, biogas (including landfill gas), 
and wave, current and tidal energy.
• Law Amending the Law on the Utilization of Renewable Energy Resources in Electricity Generation 
(Law No: 6094)
This law introduces significant amendments to improve 
the incentive mechanism under the Renewable Energy 
Law and encourage renewable energy investment opportunities in Turkey (8). The following are its main points:
- Each supplier who sells electrical energy to consumers has an obligation to pay a renewable energy 
fee proportional to the amount of electricity that the 
supplier has sold to its consumers divided by the total 
electric energy that all suppliers have sold to all consumers in the country. In other words, they are indirectly 
obliged to purchase electricity that is generated from 
renewable resources.
- A new feed-in tariff plan, categorizing the different 
levels of feed-in tariff for different technologies is introduced. In addition, the local equipment bonus is to be 
added to the feed-in tariff plan.
- The scope of time for the support mechanism is extended 
for facilities that are commissioned before the December 31, 
2015. (According to a Board Decision in December 2013, this 
date was extended to December 31, 2020).
- Feed-in tariffs are based on the USD (United States 
Dollar) and not subject to any escalation.
- Land Usage Fee Incentives: Until 2020, a discount 
of 85% for permission, lease, easement rights and 
servitude right fees for generation facilities based on 
renewable energy resources will be applicable for the 
first 10 years, including the period of investment and 
operation.
• Energy Efficiency Law (Law No: 5627)
The purpose of this Law (9) is to increase efficiency in using 
energy sources by avoiding waste, easing the burden of 
energy costs on the economy and protecting the environment. This law covers principles and procedures applicable to increasing and promoting energy efficiency in the 
energy generation, transmission, distribution and consumption phases at industrial establishments, buildings, 
power generation plants, transmission and distribution 
networks and transport. It also raises energy awareness in 
the general public.
• Environmental Law (Law No: 2872), amended in 2006
Industrial plants receive a reduction of up to 50% of their 
electricity bills if they set up their own waste treatment 
facilities (10).• Geothermal Law (Law No: 5686)
This law (11) establishes the rules and principles for effective search, exploration, development, production and protection of geothermal and natural mineral water resources. 
It also additionally defines the rights of the beneficiaries 
for their economic use of resources in compliance with 
regulations and reclamation of after use. 
• Energy Efficiency Strategy Paper 2012-2023
The Turkish Government has a strong commitment to energy 
efficiency. This document (4) presents strategic guidelines and 
actions for creating energy efficiency in the building, transportation and industrial sectors in Turkey. It plans to enhance energy efficiency, preventing unconscious use and dissipation, and 
decreasing energy density either within the sectorial base or 
at the macro level. These guidelines form important components of the Turkish national energy policy, in all its stages from 
energy production and transmission to final consumption.
• The Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources
Strategic Plan (2010-2014)
The plan (5) encompasses energy policy guidelines focused 
on energy security and mitigation of fossil fuel imports, taking 
advantage of the available renewable sources in the country.
1.2.2 Commission Staff Working Document. European 
Commission Guidance for the Design of renewables 
support schemes. November 5, 2013
Due to market regulatory failures (e.g. low competition 
level), support schemes are necessary to promote the penetration of renewable energy. The European Commission 
has recently issued a document4
 exploring best practices 
in reforming/designing these mechanisms.
In order for the support schemes to adapt to the falling 
cost of renewables, a reform is mandatory. It is important 
to take into account that this kind of changes normally has an 
impact on capital financing costs. Therefore, the reform process should be managed considering the following aspects:
• Long term legal commitments on the timing and 
phasing out of support
• Devising a support scheme that is flexible enough to 
account for changes in the development of costs and 
technologies
• Announcement of automatic reductions in support depending on specified caps and/or lower technology costs
• Planned review periods and no unannounced interim 
changes
• Clear commitments to avoid changes that alter the 
return on investments already made and undermine 
investors’ legitimate expectations
• Wide and public consultation on scheme design
• Stable scheme financing in line with the EU-acquis 
linked to consumption and off-budget financing to 
avoid fiscal impacts and uncertainty
• Keep costs transparent and separate from other 
system costs
The main objective of the above mentioned communication is to encourage the integration of support schemes in 
the market. Firstly, competitive allocation mechanisms (e.g. 
auctions) lead to price reductions. In addition, price decrease is also achieved through competition. The more players 
entering the auction process the lower the resulting price.
Feed in premiums are support schemes with greater 
interaction with the market than feed-in tariff systems, so 
that feed in premiums should be given priority over feed in 
tariffs. Best practice for feed in premium schemes includes:
• Preference for feed in premiums over feed-in tariffs for 
technologies that are approaching maturity
• Determine the form of premium - floating (with or 
without cap) or fixed – as function of desirable exposure of producers to price risk
• No payment of premiums for production in hours 
where the system price is negative or above the level of 
remuneration deemed necessary
• Use of competitive allocation mechanisms for granting premiums
• Planned volume based premium reductions for new 
installations, dependent on when they are approved, 
connected or commissioned
• Regular, planned and inclusive reviews of premiums 
for new installations
Another form of promoting market integration is through 
quota obligations. This instrument exposes the energy 
producer to market prices, since the energy has to be sold 
in the relevant market.Moreover, favoring investment over operating support will 
decouple production from the sales price and might be 
appropriate to promote market integration. Tax exemptions and Feed in tariffs are two additional support mechanisms used in the renewable energy sector. It has already 
been said that feed in premiums have a better interaction 
with the market. Nevertheless, given that feed in tariff is 
one of the most widely adopted support mechanism, best 
practice for it are presented below:
• Phase out of feed in tariffs (may be appropriate if 
combined with a pre-set capacity cap (per technology 
or market segment) for small scale activities and/or in 
non-developed markets)
• Tariffs need built-in cost-based or expected costbased reductions in tariff levels for new installations 
(in line with learning curves and expected future cost 
reductions in various technologies)
• Planned volume based tariff reductions for new 
installations, dependent on when they are approved, 
connected or commissioned
Apart from market integration, the European Commission 
highlights in its communication the importance of minimizing system impacts on power markets. Electricity grid 
balancing, dispatching rules and grid cost management 
are the main points addressed.
To finalize, when it comes to design/reform support 
schemes, the cost of the different renewable technologies plays an important role. To start with, the process for 
determining costs has to be carried out in an exhaustive 
way. Once actual costs are known, the support level can 
be set transparently including all estimated costs. The 
recommendation is that support schemes should be 
dynamic, independently of the way in which they were 
set initially. Periodic review and adjustment of the support 
level should be performed together with the setting of 
time frames for the mechanism.
1.2.3 Objective of the Renewable Energy National 
Action Plan (REAP)
The objective of Turkey’s national Renewable Energy 
Action Plan (REAP) presented under Directive 2009/28/
EC is the establishment of strategies to promote the 
development of renewable energy in Turkey. These 
strategies are set to: 
• Ensure that the share of renewable energy in electricity production has increased to 30% of the total 
demand by 2023, based on the high accessibility of 
bliTk
• Fulfill the level of usage of renewable energies in transportation established in the Directive 2009/28/EC: a 10% 
share of renewable energy in the transportation sector. 
• Ensure technological and industrial development 
based on the installation of a higher renewable energy 
capacity by 2023.
• Plan use of renewable energy resources taking into 
consideration the impact of climate change and sustainability to the ecosystem, orienting plans toward the 
mitigation of climate change (3).
• Avoid obstacles in developing renewable energy in 
the country, by enabling the following: 
- financial support for projects, 
- removal of barriers linked to the administrative
process, 
- develop legal framework for the implementation
of new solutions, 
- provide secure access to renewable energy for
electricity generation 
- optimize the usage of any relevant infrastructure 
- develop support mechanisms
• Develop an appropriate framework to promote the 
penetration of distributed generation based on renewable energies and the usage of renewable energy 
in buildings.2
EXPECTED ENERGY 
CONSUMPTION 2013 – 2023In order to bring Turkey’s strategy in line with the European 
Union’s 2009 Renewables Directive, Turkey’s National Renewable Energy Action Plan evaluates the expected final 
gross energy consumption for the period of 2013-2023. The 
gross energy consumption forecast is broken down into 
the sectors of electricity, heating and cooling, and transportation (encompassing petrol, diesel and biofuels consumed in road and rail transportation as well as electricity). 
This evaluation takes into consideration the expected 
effects of energy efficiency policy measures. In this regard, 
the ‘reference scenario’ only considers the energy efficiency and the energy savings measures taken into account 
prior to 2013. While the ‘additional energy efficiency scenario’ would take into account all the additional policy measures in energy efficiency that could be considered from 
2013 to 2023, including the growth of renewable energy.
Moreover, in the short term the Turkish Government in 
collaboration with the EBRD plans to launch a NEEAP to establish a common framework of measures for the promotion of energy efficiency within Turkey in order to ensure 
the achievement of the future Turkish’s targets on energy 
efficiency and to pave the way for further energy efficiency 
improvements.
Economic, international, and geopolitical uncertainties 
could cause inevitable deviation from the expected objectives. Accordingly, the development of the expected gross 
energy consumption in the sectors of electricity, heating 
and cooling, and transportation should be considered a 
guideline and not an exact prediction of development in 
these areas in Turkey. In order to better understand both 
scenarios, a brief overview of Turkey’s energy requirements 
is detailed below.
Economic Growth
During the last seven years, Turkey has undergone a profound economic transformation and its economy experienced remarkable development. Turkey is the 17th largest 
economy in the world and the 6th largest economy in 
Europe with GDP of 1.6 trillion TL in 2013 in current prices.
The average annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth 
rate from 2003 to 2013 was 4.96%, with the GDP reaching 
TL 122.5 billion in 2013. Figure 6 demonstrates the GDP 
development of Turkey
The real GDP growth decelerated sharply in 2012 due to 
weaker economic conditions in the EU (Turkey’s main 
export market), however in 2013 GDP experienced a 4.12% 
increase compared to the previous year. In the short term, 
international economic institutions forecast high growth 
rates, estimating: 5.1% for the period of 2012-2017 and 4.3% 
for the period of 2018-2030. Turkey’s potential GDP increase 
is depicted in Figure 7.
Energy consumption
Turkey’s continuous economic growth during recent decades has made Turkey increasingly dependent on imported 
energy supplies. Turkey’s total primary energy consumption in 2012 was 121 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe), 
6% higher than in 2011, which was 114 Mtoe; again, most of 
the supply was imported.

2.13Figure 9 shows the primary energy production and consumption. Accordingly, in 2012 Turkish energy production 
from national resources accounted for approximately 26% 
of primary energy consumption.
Moreover, Turkey is one of the highest countries in terms 
of energy consumption per GDP (energy intensity5
) 
compared to the rest of the largest European countries 
excluding Poland; its energy intensity was 0.27 toe per 
$1,000 of GDP in 2013. 
Turkey’s primary energy supply is expected to rise in the next 
decade, the forecast is estimated to be 158 Mtoe for 2023. 
Turkey has a high correlation between energy consumption 
and GDP evolution, more than 95% of R2, with an increase of 
1 billion TL in GDP resulting in a fuel consumption increase of 
0.116 Mtoe. In relative terms, an increase of 1% in GDP would 
result in an increase of 3.4% in the national energy consumption. Figure 10 depicts the strong correlation between the 
evolution of energy consumption and GDP.
With reference to final consumption, electricity consumption is expected to experience an increase of 72% compared to 2013 figures (it would increase from 246 TWh in 
2012 to 424 TWh in 2023). The Government is committed 
to promoting alternative energy solutions to mitigate this 
energy dependency.
Additionally as shown in Figure 12, the energy consumption 
in the transportation sector is expected to reach 29.4 million 
toe in 2020 and 34.5 million toe in 2023 according to the International Energy Agency and Deloitte forecasts respectively6

0The breakdown of energy supply for the transportation 
sector shows that biomass has just begun being used in 
the sector. As it can be seen in Figure 13, the share of biomass was 0.11% in 2012: its contribution is still negligible 
and the major energy source for this sector is oil.
Energy efficiency
The Energy Efficiency Strategy Paper for 2012 - 2023 targets 
a decrease of at least 20% of the amount of energy consumed per unit Turkish GDP in the year 2023, by taking 2008 
as reference year. The objectives established under this 
strategy paper can be summarized as follows:
• To reduce energy intensity and energy losses in industry and services sectors.
• To decrease the energy demand and carbon emissions of buildings: to promote sustainable environmentally friendly buildings using renewable energy sources.
• To promote a market transformation toward energy 
efficient products.
• To increase efficiency in production, transmission and 
• To reduce fossil fuel consumption of motorized 
vehicles, by increasing the share of public transportation on highways, maritime transit and railroads and 
by preventing unnecessary fuel consumption in urban 
transportation.
• To use energy effectively and efficiently in the public 
sector.
• To strengthen institutional capacities and collaborations.
• To increase the use of state of the art technology and 
building awareness through diverse activities.
• To develop financial mechanisms other than public 
financial institutions.
Based on the strategic objectives established in the Energy 
Efficiency Strategy Paper, Table 1 includes estimates of final 
energy consumption in the areas of heating and cooling, 
electricity and transport. The ‘reference scenario’ and ‘additional energy efficiency scenario’ are presented separately. 
The reference scenario includes all the measures on energy 
efficiency and energy saving taken before 2013, while the 
additional energy efficiency scenario forecast includes all 
the additional measures in energy efficiency and energy 
savings that would be undertaken from 2013 onwards.
New energy efficiency guidelines will be given in the future NEEAP, which will be developed in the near future by the 
Turkish Government in collaboration with the EBRD. 
Electricity
The following targets depicted in Figure 14 have been 
established for renewable energy penetration in the electricity sector for 2023 according to :
By 2023, 61,000 MW of renewable energy will be installed 
to generate approximately 159 TWh. Figure 15 shows the 
electricity generation and installed capacity for 2013 and 
forecasts for 2023. 7

RENEWABLE ENERGY TARGETS
AND TRAJECTORIES3.1 Overall national target 
According to the guidelines of the Ministry of Energy 
and Resources the main strategic issues regarding energy 
policy in the next decade are: 
• Reduction of energy dependency in order to mitigate 
the risks linked to high energy dependency on fossil fuel 
supplies from other countries and the volatility of their 
prices, and their impact on economic development.
• Additional capacity to reach 125,000 MW and supply 
the estimated demand growth of 75.4% between 
2012 and 2023: the Government strategy includes 
an increase in natural gas10 and nuclear generation 
capacity, and establishes an increase of the share of 
renewable energy in electricity generation of at least 
30% of the total.
• The objectives for the different technologies are 
34,000 MW of hydropower, 20,000 MW of wind energy, 
1,000 MW of geothermal energy, 5,000 MW of solar 
energy (photovoltaic and concentrated solar power) 
and 1,000 MW of biomass (the biomass target is not yet 
included in the official documents).
• Improvement of the transmission grid infrastructure is 
targeted, 60,717 km of lines and 158,460 MVA of power 
distribution unit capacity is expected.
• Improvement of energy efficiency in the electricity 
transmission grids, reducing electricity loss/theft up to 
an average of 5% and extending the use of smart grids 
is targeted.
• Taking full advantage of the agricultural sector enhancing the biofuel industry (biodiesel and bioethanol).
The intention of Turkey’s REAP is to have at least 20% of 
renewable energy sources for its general energy consumption in 2023. Considering an expected total energy 
consumption of 107 Mtoe, which would imply an energy 
consumption of 21.7 Mtoe from renewable energy sources.
The overall national target for the share of energy from 
renewable sources in final gross consumption of energy in 
2010 and 2023 is presented in Table 2.

Expected result134.1B Incentives to promote new investments
in Turkey 
The New Investment Incentives Program in Turkey has 
been effective since the January 1, 2012 and offers four 
different kinds of plans (12):
1. General Investment Incentive Plan: The plan is 
available for all investment types considering that the 
investment category is not excluded from the program 
list, and that the minimum defined fixed investment 
amount is fulfilled. Within this framework, electricity generation facilities with renewable energy generation are 
entitled to VAT and customs duty exemption, but other 
facilities are entitled to the incentives listed below.
2. Regional Investment Incentive Plan: These incentives are 
allocated depending on the region to eliminate inter-regional imbalances within the country. Minimum investment 
amounts have been determined for different kinds of 
investments. If not stated for the specific type of project, the 
minimum investment amount is TL 1 Million for Regions 1 
and 2, and TL 500,000 for regions 3, 4, 5, and 6. An additional 
labor cost deduction of 38% is available only for region 6.
Figure 17: Regions of Turkey according to incentive plan
Region 1 Region 4
Region 2 Region 5
Region 3 Region 6
3. Large Scale Investment Incentive Plan: The goal 
of this program is to improve Turkey’s technological 
abilities and R&D capacity.
4. Strategic Investment Incentive Plan: This plan is offered 
for production of intermediate and final goods with high 
import dependence (more than 50%). Investments of TL 
50 million or above are eligible to benefit from this plan.
These incentive plans, depending on the activities undertaken, can be applied to renewable energy facilities, R&D 
initiatives, development of equipment and the manufacturing of component parts for the renewable energy 
power plant.
Early stage exploration, including exploratory drilling, is arguably the most risky stage for a geothermal project developer from a financial and technical perspective. Currently, 
there have been some exceptional cases, where private 
sector investors have developed geothermal fields from 
surface exploration stage, financed by the company’s equity. In collaboration with International Financial Institutions, 
the Government will develop programs to support private 
sector investors to participate in early stages of development of geothermal resources, in parallel with the MTA activities. This support will come in the forms of risk-sharing 
mechanisms, drilling insurance programs, concessional 
funds with limited recourse to the parent company and/or 
equity or quasi-equity (mezzanine) products. Additionally, 
the Government could support private sector investment 
for early stage geothermal development by offering an 
additional FiT premium for projects. New formulation of FIT 
will be elaborated regarding the scale and technology (for 
instance the use of waste heated water in greenhouses).
The potential of energy technologies, such as Hot Dry 
Rock and Tidal/Wave, needs to be considered. Hot Dry 
Rock describes the process of extracting heat from deep 
crystalline rock while Tidal/Current energy technologies 
are designed to capture the kinetic motion of the ebbing 
and surging of ocean tides in order to produce electricity. 
Both technologies (Hot Dry Rock and Tidal/Current) have a 
promising future in Turkey, as the country has an extensive 
surface and a large coastline, suitable to develop them. 
Therefore, financial support for R&D and the promotion of 
these technologies will be established. 
4.1C Feed-in Tariff 
The legal framework, the Law on the Utilization of 
Renewable Energy Resources for the Purpose of Generating Electrical Energy (Law No: 5346) (7), established an 
incentive plan for the promotion of renewable energy in 
Turkey, this plan has been modified by the Law Amending the Utilization of Renewable Energy Resources in 
Electricity Generation (Law No: 6094) (8). The incentive

General 
Investment Regional Investment Large Scale Investment Strategic Investmentfrom these tariffs during the first 10 years, beginning on 
the date of operation and for facilities that are commissioned before the December 31, 2015. The plan has been 
extended until 2020.
Each year, the investor can choose between this feed-in tariff plan and direct sales in the power market. The plan takes 
into consideration the following issues: 
• Wind and hydro energy have very challenging targets15, which would be difficult to meet without taking 
necessary precautionary actions. There are many obstacles and the most critical ones include the following: 
Investors have difficulty in accessing financial support, 
as most financial providers take the feed-in tariff as the 
reference price for electricity (however, the forecasted 
market price is higher than this feed-in tariff ) and the 
forecasted project cash flow (based on feed-in tariffs) 
are not attractive enough for financial providers and 
guarantees are required creating a barrier for new 
generation facilities.
• Solar energy also has a significant target for 2023, 
5,000 MW should be installed by the end of 2023 
(currently, the penetration of solar technologies is only 
marginal). However, due to the evolution of solar PV 
technology, the investment cost has dropped during 
recent years. Thanks to this fact, together with the high 
availability of solar irradiation in Turkey, it would not 
be necessary to incentivize in the medium term to 
promote solar PV technology. 
• Biomass energy has a low penetration rate in 
the country and its development depends on the 
current feed-in tariff in the short term as well as the 
availability of raw materials, which depend on the 
type of technology.
• The current feed-in tariff plan established for hydropower and geothermal energy are appropriate for the 
feasibility of these investments.
Additionally, an incentive to promote the use of local 
equipment has been established to promote the development of a national industry. 
15. For wind energy, it would be necessary to develop approximately 
17,800 MW between December 2012 and the end of 2023. In the hydro 
The Government is evaluating the possibility to link 
the feed-in tariff to the necessary time (and the level of 
difficulty) to fulfill the targets. The framework could be 
developed according to the following scheme:
1. A level of renewable energy technology penetration 
is established for a yearly period. During this time, there would be a fixed feed-in tariff scheme (USD/MWh).
2. If the penetration target were fulfilled before the end 
of the period, a lower feed-in tariff scheme would be 
applied for the rest of the period and the next.
3. If the penetration target were not fulfilled before 
the end of the period, an equal or higher feed-in tariff 
scheme would be applied for the rest of the period 
and the next.
The incentive would be adapted dynamically to the level 
of renewable energy penetration: For instance; incentives given according to scale and region (regions that are 
difficult to invest in such as altitude or construction). These 
mechanisms would allow identifying the technologies 
that require less (or do not need) incentives. 
To obtain the guaranteed FIT, geothermal projects will be 
required to integrate in a design mechanism that either 
abate or re-inject non-condensable fluids, extracted from 
the geothermal resources.
4.1D Management of licensing and authorizing 
procedures 
Given the impact that renewable energy projects have 
on the economy and society, it is necessary to establish 
control mechanisms to assure the adequate development 
of these technologies. A number of authorizations and 
permits from different bodies are required.
Today, the licensing and permits procedures are costly and 
time consuming. This fact might discourage investors and 
delay the deployment of new activities in the renewable 
energy business. Therefore, there is a need to improve the 
administrative procedures to enable a large penetration of 
renewable energy in Turkey. The Directive establishes the simplicity in the administrative procedures, avoiding duplication and reducing 
unnecessary delays. The following three aspects could be 
considered in order to speed up the process:
• A one-stop-shop: it would avoid duplications and the 
need to manage the necessary tasks with different bodies.
• Time limit to manage administrative tasks: it would 
reduce delays in the different processes.
• Positive administrative silence: in case of no response, 
the application would be automatically authorized, 
helping to reduce the time.
These three measures are explained in detail throughout 
this document.
4.1E National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) 
The Turkish Government in collaboration with the EBRD 
is expected to launch the National Energy Efficiency 
Action Plan (NEEAP) to establish a common framework of 
measures for the promotion of energy efficiency within 
Turkey in order to ensure the achievement of the future 
Turkish’s targets on energy efficiency and to pave the way 
for further energy efficiency improvements.
In line with the Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on energy 
efficiency (13), the NEEAP is expected to be completed 
by taking into consideration the guidance (14) and the 
template (15) published by the European Commission. It 
is important to note that, the objectives to be included in 
the future NEEAP could modify the different targets included throughout this report, the Turkish REAP:

The objectives to be included in the future NEEAP could 
modify the different targets included throughout this 
report, the Turkish REAP.4.2 Specific measures to fulfill the requirements 
under Articles 13, 14, 16 and Articles 17 to 21 of 
Directive 2009/28/EC 
4.2.1 Administrative procedures and spatial planning 
(Article 13(1) of Directive 2009/28/EC)
a) List of existing national and, if applicable, regional 
procedures concerning authorization, certification, 
licensing and spatial planning applied to plants and 
associated transmission and distribution network 
infrastructure for the production of electricity and 
heating or cooling from renewable sources.
Authorization, certification and licensing procedures 
linked to the renewable energy projects.
The licensing procedures for renewable energy investments have similar requirements to those of other 
technologies defined in the Electricity Market Law 
and License Regulation; however, the specific requirements for the different renewable sources differ from 
one to another. 
For solar and wind power plants, grid connection is 
the most critical step before being entitled to a license. 
The New Electricity Market Law regulates the tender 
process for grid connection rights. In light of this, all 
solar and wind projects that apply at the same transformation center for grid connection, will require a 
mandatory tender based on a contribution fee payable 
to the Transmission System Operator for the first 3 years 
following commissioning. Land restrictions do apply 
especially in the case of solar and wind energy that 
require the vast use of land.
For small hydro generation units, water usage rights are 
granted by the General Directorate of State Hydraulic 
Works (DSI) and a water usage fee is payable to the DSI. 
This General Directorate can also organize tenders for the 
water usage rights.
In the case of biomass power plants, a tender is applicable to those companies who want to build a power 
plant that uses landfill gas as a fuel. In those cases, usage 
rights to the city landfill are granted through a tender by 
the municipality.
Additionally, any natural or legal entity generating less 
than 1 MW in its facility can benefit from the feed-in 
tariff defined by the Renewable Energy Support Mechanism without a generation license. However, although 
shorter, easier and cheaper, it should be noted that 
there are some permits and legal procedures for these 
facilities as well: municipality licenses, connection to 
the distribution company and certification to withstand 
earthquakes, etc.
Other authorizations and licensing procedures include documentation for regional and local authorities as well as those 
regarding the specific characteristics of the project.

Figure 19: List of administrative procedures to install new renewable power capacityBelow are the requirements for the administrative licenses 
and procedures that should be managed at the regional level:
In order to avoid delays in the licensing and authorizing 
processes, these procedures will be reviewed by the 
Government adopting them under Directive 2006/123/EC 
on services in the internal market: mandatory deadlines 
should be established for the different administrative tasks 
in order to reduce process delays. 
Additionally, in the case of unlicensed generation, some 
of the administrative requirements are similar to those of 
large facilities.
The Directive establishes the simplicity in the administrative procedures, avoiding duplication. It also establishes 
a time limit to manage administrative tasks (e.g. three 
months) and the positive administrative silence. Moreover, 
a one-stop-shop for licensing procedures would enable 
the management of the abovementioned processes.
Due to the large number of administrative tasks that are 
necessary to install new power capacity, a one-stop-shop 
approach would simplify the licensing process and reduce 
cost and time.
The license for exploration activities in geothermal energy 
is a special case that should be reviewed: in order to increase the penetration of this technology, the cost of the license should be reduced and the information about possible 
locations for geothermal capacity should be improved.
b) Responsible Ministry(ies)/authority(ies) and their 
responsibility in the field
Power plants that have an installed capacity greater 
than 1 MW are required to obtain a generation license 
from the Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EPDK). 
EPDK hliliih bl
of wind energy investments, EPDK has gained substantial 
experience since 2007, however for solar, the mechanisms are quite new and EPDK will be gaining necessary 
experience throughout the process.
Depending on the renewable energy technology, other 
entities have to authorize the new facility: 
• The Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources - the 
General Directorate of Renewable Energy: responsible for all renewable energy sources. The technical 
assessment of the energy license applications are 
performed under this organization.
• The General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works: 
hydropower units.
• Turkish State Meteorological Service: measurement 
station installation permits for wind farms and solar 
power facilities.
• The Secretary General of Special Provincial Administration and the General Directorate of Mining Affairs 
(under the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources): 
geothermal energy.
• The Ministry of Environment and Urbanization: environmental impact assessment reports and distributed 
generation based on renewable energy in buildings.
• System Operator: tendering process for wind and 
solar energy and evaluating the connection of licensed 
renewable energy units to the grid.
Responsibilities at regional and local levels are described 
in point 4.2.1.e.
The revision of the procedures would enable the review 
process of the requirements established in the permits 
and authorizing processes, and allow the investor and 
operator to have easier and shorter processes.
A one-stop-shop approach would avoid duplications and 
the need to manage the necessary tasks with different 
bodies. Additionally, a reasonable time scope for each 
procedure would reduce delays.
• Environmental Impact Assessment Report from the Ministry of Environment 
and Urbanization.
• Cadastral records from the General Directorate of Land Registry and Cadaster.
• Spatial approval and expropriation require local authorization for land use. 
It is compulsory to get the necessary clearances from the following organizations for the land that will be used for the project: The municipality where the 
investment will be made, the municipality of the greater region (if applicable), 
the Special Provincial Administration, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, the 
Regional Board of Preservation of Cultural Assets, the Regional Board of the Preservation of Natural Assets and the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization.
On the other hand, depending on the characteristics of the project, investors 
should get the approval of the following institutions: the General Directorate of 
Nature Preservation and National Parks, the State Highways Commission, the 
State Hydraulic Works, the Regional Board of Preservation of Cultural Assets, the 
provincial organization of the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock, the 
Regional Directorate of Forestry, the provincial organization of the Ministry of 
Environment and Urbanization, the Transmission System Operator, the provincial 
organization of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, BOTAŞ (the National Natural 
Gas Transmission Company), Türk Telekom (the telecom company), the regional 
electricity distribution company and the regional gas distribution company.c) Revision with a view toward taking appropriate 
measures to comply with the meaning of Article 13, 
paragraph 1 of Directive 2009/28/EC planned before 
the end of 2015.
Article 14 of the New Electricity Market Law (Law No. 
6446) (6) defines the activities entitled under law to be conducted without license: the maximum installed capacity 
for a renewable energy plant to operate without a license 
has been established at 1 MW. In addition, The Board of 
Ministers is authorized to increase the maximum installed 
capacity for a renewable energy plant to operate without 
a license to 5 MW. It is also important to mention that renewable energy power plants that do not connect the load 
to the system (generation and consumption take place at 
the same location) do not need any kind of license.
The detailed procedures have been explained in point 
4.2.1.a of this document.
On the other hand, in order to make administrative requirements quicker and avoid duplication, in the medium term 
there will be a revision of licensing and permits procedures 
to install renewable energy facilities as well as unlicensed 
generation. For instance, a one-stop-shop would be a 
good way to speed up and resolve licenses and permits 
without delays or duplications, avoiding bureaucracy.
d) Have obstacles or disproportionate requirements 
been detected in relation to the approval, certification or licensing rules applicable to plants and 
associated transmission and distribution network infrastructure for the generation of electricity, heating 
or cooling from renewable sources and to the transformation of biomass into biofuels or other energy 
products? If so, which?
Sometimes, the process to apply for new generation 
licenses can be time consuming. It would be necessary 
to review the administrative processes in order to reduce 
unnecessary delays and make the process quicker.
The licensing process should be made faster and delays 
in the management of these tasks should be avoided. 
Concentrated effort from the investors is required in time 
consuming tasks. In order to shorten the period for permits and view processes:
• Reasonable time scopes could be implemented for 
the different administrative tasks.
• Positive administrative silence could be set for these 
procedures, as a part of the one-stop-shop approach.
• A one-stop-shop could be implemented to centralize 
ll hliid hiid
In the case of unlicensed generation, some of the administrative requirements are similar to those of large facilities, 
and the following should also be considered for the 
unlicensed generation: municipal licenses, connection to 
the distribution company and certification of earthquake 
readiness. Furthermore, there is no difference in application and documentation for very small scale unlicensed 
projects and 1 MW projects. Topics regarding different 
administrative procedures which will enable cost effective 
measures for very small scale projects are expected to be 
considered in the coming months. 
Additionally, the legal framework to develop the distributed generation on a large scale; the establishment of 
an economic incentive for the distribution company to 
enable the installation of new capacity based on its positive externalities should be considered.
e) What level of administration (local, regional and 
national) is responsible for authorizing, certifying 
and licensing renewable energy installations and 
for spatial planning? (If it depends on the type 
of installation, please specify.) If more than one 
level is involved, how is coordination between the 
different levels managed? How will coordination 
between different responsible authorities be improved in the future?
Several different authorities have roles in the authorization and approval processes in licensing procedures: 
• Environmental Impact Assessment Report from the 
Ministry of Environment and Urbanization.
• Cadastral records from the General Directorate of 
Land Registry and Cadaster.
• Spatial approval and expropriation rights require local 
authorization for land use.
It is essential to get the necessary clearance from the 
following organizations for the land that will be used for 
the project: The municipality where the investment will be 
made, the municipality of the greater region (if applicable), 
the Special Provincial Administration, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, the Regional Board of Preservation of Culture Assets, the Regional Board of Preservation of Natural 
Assets and the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization.
Depending on the specific characteristics of the project, 
the investor should get the approval of the institutions 
listed below: the General Directorate of Nature Preservation and National Parks, the State Highways Commission, 
the State Hydraulic Works, the Regional Board of Preserva
if Cll Ahiil iif hDirectorate of Forestry, the provincial organization of the 
Ministry of Environment and Urbanization, the Transmission System Operator, the provincial organization of the 
Ministry of Culture and Tourism, BOTAŞ (the National Natural Gas Transmission Company), Türk Telekom (the telecom 
company), the regional electricity distribution company 
and the regional gas distribution company.
The ultimate license application portfolio should include: 
the Letter of Application (from EPDK), the Authorization Certificate (from EPDK), the Principal Agreement or 
Commercial Registry Gazette (also for partners of legal 
entities), the Production Plant Information Form (from the 
Applicant), the Single-Line Diagram (from the Applicant), 
the Map and Settlement Plan 1/25,000 scale (from the 
Ministry of Environment and Urbanization, the document 
about the right of resource utilization (referring to hydro, 
biomass, and geothermal power plants), No-Lien Affidavit 
with the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, the Statement of Partnership Structure (from Commercial Registry Gazette), the Declaration of Financial Status (from the 
Applicant) and the Letter of Guarantee (from the Bank).
In medium term, a one-stop-shop should be implemented in order to coordinate the different bodies and tasks to 
avoid unnecessary efforts and delays.
It would be beneficial that the activities of monitoring and 
controlling the licensing and authorizing procedures are 
performed by the General Directorate of Renewable Energy.
• Identify inefficient procedures and duplications in the 
abovementioned processes. 
• Identify non-justified delays in the performance of 
licensing and authorizing procedures.
• Identify non-justified delays in the grid access application.
• Identify non-appropriate practices in the licensing and 
authorizing application: discrimination in the application processes, abusive practices in the reserve of 
capacity, abusive conditions, speculative practices, etc.
Based on its controlling activity, the Agency will give recommendations to improve the licensing and authorizing 
procedures. A report will be issued every year.
f) How is it ensured that comprehensive information 
on the processing of authorization, certification and 
licensing applications and on assistance to applicants 
is made available? What information and assistance 
is available to potential applicants for new renewable 
energy installations on their applications?
Today, comprehensive information and assistance to 
applicants are the responsibility of different organizations 
depending on the technology. Nevertheless, a one-stop-shop 
approach would make the process more efficient by facilitating administrative procedures. The design of the one-stopshop for the renewable energy in Turkey should follow the 
guidelines defined by Directive 2006/123/EC on services in 
the internal market, simplifying procedures and requirements, 
and avoiding duplications.
For solar and wind, the General Directorate of Meteorological Works provides information regarding the procedures for starting measurements and the application for land 
use permits. In addition, EPDK publishes the procedures to 
take part in the tenders on its website.
In the case of geothermal energy, the investors can ask for 
instruction about the procedure to access the geothermal 
source from the Secretary General of Special Provincial 
Administration.
Investors can consult with the General Directorate of State 
Hydraulic Works for information on water usage rights 
agreements and the development of new hydropower 
facilities. The information about the process to apply for 
the generation license is published by EPDK both on its 
website and in the Official Gazette.
Finally, the System Operator TEİAŞ publishes documents 
on procedures with the information on the conditions to 
access and operate power generation units in Turkey.
g) How is horizontal coordination facilitated between 
different administrative bodies, responsible for the 
different parts of the permit? How many procedural 
steps are needed to receive the final authorization/
license/permit? Is there a one-stop shop for coordinating all steps? Are timetables for processing applications communicated in advance? What is the average 
time for obtaining a decision for the application?
Referring to the abovementioned procedures, the 
license application process for energy generation from 
renewable energy requires completion of different steps 
through interaction with several authorities. The pre-license period is defined as taking 6 months - 2 years. Currently, 
there is no one-stop-shop for the coordination of all the 
effort needed in the process.In order to facilitate the administrative task, reducing the 
task time scope and avoiding duplication, the licensing and 
permit procedures will be reviewed by the Government 
adopting the procedure under Directive 2006/123/EC on 
services in the internal market. Among other considerations, the following rules should be taken into account: 
• Necessary requirements to install new renewable 
energy capacity must be reexamined and redefined 
with a focus on optimizing the necessary control and 
ease of doing business.
• Stakeholders who grant the permissions should be 
redefined with an optimization focus and should be 
enabled to share a common database relevant for the 
renewable permits. The database should be accessed 
and used by the licensing authority and the transmission 
system operator at the very least. A one-stop-shop to manage all the permits, licenses and authorizations necessary to install new power capacity should be established. 
• A reengineering study for the administrative activities 
should be conducted with a focus on both enhancing 
the IT infrastructure for the smooth and fast operation of the permitting procedures. Information and 
document requirements from different administrative 
bodies should be optimized.
• A timeframe must be set to manage the different administrative tasks (no more than a three month period 
for each step) and the total licensing procedure (no 
more than one year). 
• A positive administrative silence should be established: in case of no response the application would be 
automatically authorized.
h) Do authorization procedures take into account the 
specifics of the different renewable energy technologies? If so, please describe how. If they do not, do you 
envisage taking them into account in the future?
The common procedures to be taken into account for 
each different renewable energy technology are:
Additionally, renewable energy investors for any renewable energy technology have to complete the licensing 
application process described in question 4.2.1.h.
Solar energy
• When selecting a field for their solar power plants, investors should consider the 
announced regions/transformer centers set out by the Ministry, including the 
radiance values and field characteristics.
• Investors must acquire installation report from the General Directorate of 
Meteorology (GDM) in order to install measurement stations.
• Companies that apply to the GDM should complete their application process 
within 15 days.
• After the GDM grants approval, 6 months of measurement in the field should be 
completed. The remaining 6 months should be completed with existing or GDM 
values (for a total of 1 year of measured data).
• Collected/recorded data covering a 1 year period are sent to the GDM for a final 
control at least 30 days before an application is sent to EPDK.
• Applications are then evaluated by YEGM in a technical perspective. After this 
stage, EPDK evaluates the applications an administrative perspective.
• If same region/transformer center has received more than one application, then 
applications are sent to TEİAŞ in order to organize a competition – a competitive 
analysis or competition between existing applicants. 
• If an application does not share any regions/transformer centers with other 
applicants, then the licensing process starts.
• The field to be utilized for solar energy power plants needs to be owned either 
by the applicant or the government.
Hydro energy
• Before applying for a license for hydro power plants, a Water Usage Rights 
Agreement should be signed with the State Hydraulic Works.
Biomass energy
• A fuel provision agreement or energy type provision agreement should be 
committed to by both legal entities (producer of the fuel/energy resource and 
the applicant).
Wind energy
• Investors would benefit from the Wind Energy Atlas of Turkey before selecting a site for a 
wind power plant so they would be able to choose sites that are suitable for investment.
• The land restrictions for building wind energy power plants are as follows: according 
to National Parks Law No: 2873 there are certain defined fields that cannot be utilized 
for wind energy power plants. These include national parks, natural parks, natural monuments and natural monument protection areas. According to the Land Hunting Law 
No: 3167 wind energy power plants can be established in wildlife protection areas after 
obtaining necessary permits. Housing settlement areas and military fields also cannot 
be used for wind energy power plant establishment. The field to be utilized for wind 
energy power plants needs to be owned either by the applicant or the government.
• In the application process, UTM coordinates of the wind power plant to be built 
must be given. The distances between the planned turbine and existing operating turbines also should be submitted within the application. 
• Application should include the turbine model, brand, blade diameter and rotor height.
• Applications for pre-license can be submitted to EPDK in the first five business 
days of October in the scope of the announced wind capacity the year before.
· After the GDM grants approval, 6 months of measurement in the field should be 
completed. The remaining 6 months should be completed with existing or GDM 
values (for a total of 1 year of measured data).
• As an additional document, (required since the publication of the Electricity 
Market License Regulation on November 2, 2013) the applicant should provide 
total of 1 year of measured wind data obtained at least within 3 years.Electricity Market Law (Law No. 6446) (6) defines the 
activities that can be conducted without a license: the 
maximum installed capacity for a renewable energy plant 
to operate without a license has been established in 1 
MW. In addition, the Council of Ministers is authorized to 
increase the maximum installed capacity for a renewable 
energy plant to operate without a license to 5 MW. Also, 
renewable power plants, which are not connected to the 
grid, are exempted from obtaining a license (generation 
and consumption take place at the same location).
i) Are there specific procedures, for example simple 
notification, for small-scale, decentralized installations (such as solar panels on buildings or biomass 
boilers in buildings)? If so, what are the procedural 
steps? Are the rules publicly available to citizens? 
Where are they published? Is the introduction of 
simplified notification procedures planned in the 
future? If so, for which types of installation/system? 
(Is net metering possible?)
Any natural or legal entity generating less than 1 MW 
in its facility can benefit from the feed-in tariff defined by 
the Renewable Energy Support Mechanism. 
As described in the Electricity Market Law (EML), distribution 
companies holding retail licenses are obligated to purchase 
the excess electricity generated by the unlicensed renewable energy generators via relevant feed-in tariff prices.
Solar thermal energy that is used for water heating does 
not require any particular license and/or permit.
j) Where are the fees associated with applications for 
authorization/licenses/permits for new installations 
published? Are they related to the administrative 
costs of granting such permits? Is there any plan to 
revise these fees?
The license application fee is payable by the applicant 
to EPDK and announced by EPDK periodically. Only the 
ten percent of the price of having a pre license is collected 
from legal entities who apply to have pre license in order 
to establish generation power plants based on domestic 
natural resources and renewable energy. Licensing fees 
also have a recurring component; a certain amount per 
MW is applicable to EPDK on a yearly basis. The current 
license application fees are structured as follows:
Additionally, for the recurring component of the license 
fee: 0.003 kuruş per kWh generated of electricity is payable 
on a yearly basis throughout the license period.
Furthermore, all solar and wind projects connected to the 
electricity grid, that apply for the same transformer center 
to connect to the grid, have to follow a tendering process 
based on a contribution fee payable to the Transmission 
System Operator for the first 3 years following commissioning. This contribution fee depends on the tender results. 
For biomass power plants, a tender is applicable for those 
companies that want to build a power plant which uses 
landfill gas as a fuel. In that case, usage rights of the city 
landfill are granted through a tender by the municipality.
There are other fees associated with the municipal license 
and with connection to the grid. 
For unlicensed generation some fees are applicable such 
as payments to the municipality and distribution company to access the system.
k) Is official guidance available to local and regional 
administrative bodies on planning, designing, building and refurbishing industrial and residential areas 
to install equipment and systems using renewable 
energy sources in electricity and heating and cooling, 
including in district heating and cooling? If such official guidance is not available or insufficient, how and 
when will this need be addressed?
Even though there is no official guidance available 
to local and regional administrative bodies on planning, 
designing, building and refurbishing industrial and 
residential areas to install equipment and systems using 
renewable energy sources in electricity and heating and 
cooling, including in district heating and cooling, informal 
guidance is provided if there is a demand.
Nevertheless, secondary legislation clearly indicates the 
steps to be executed in detail for local and central administrative bodies for electricity generation. 
l) Are there any specific trainings for case handlers of 
authorization, certification and licensing procedures 
of renewable energy installations?
EPDK publishes guidelines about licensed and unlicensed procedures for renewable energy installations 
and also the General Directorate of Renewable Energy 
provides advice and support to the local administrative 
bodies in this field.
Turkey has renewable energy associations that provide 
support to the investors so that they can fulfill their admi

a) To benefit from support schemes do renewable 
energy technologies need to meet certain quality 
standards? If so, which installations and what quality 
standards? Are there national, regional standards 
that go beyond European standards?
The large penetration of renewable energies requires 
the fulfillment of technical and environmental necessities 
by facilities and equipment, and additionally appropriate 
procedures to guarantee the reliability and security in the 
exploitation of the electricity system.
Technical and quality measures based on international standards focused on renewable energy components, equipment and procedures must be taken into 
consideration, for example: TR-ISO 12975 for thermal solar energy (system and components), TR-ISO 
50548/60904/61829/62093 for solar PV energy, TR-ISO 
61400 for wind energy, TR-ISO 62270 for hydropower and 
TR-ISO 162014/303001 for biofuels.
Moreover, some of the renewable energy technologies 
have a high volatility. Therefore, the grid codes should be 
adapted to this characteristic in the medium term. TEİAŞ 
will update the following grid operation procedures to 
enable large renewable energy penetration:
• The requirements, criteria and procedures to manage 
secondary and tertiary reserves. 
• The participation of renewable energy facilities in the 
voltage control management.
• The criteria to develop curtailment procedures in 
order to avoid problems related to energy exports to 
the system, and to the maintenance of the security and 
reliability of the electricity system.
• The requirements that the renewable energy promoters 
have to fulfill to enable the monitoring of the facilities.
4.2.3 Buildings (Article 13(3) of Directive 2009/28/EC)
This section is built on existing documents and plans 
regarding energy in buildings. There exists a strong 
commitment from the Turkish Government to energy 
efficiency, in 2012 the Energy Efficiency Strategy Paper 
2012–2023 was published. 
a) Reference to existing national and regional legislation (if any) and summary of local legislation concerning the increase of the share of energy from renewable sources in the building sector.
The Government of Turkey is evaluating the measures 
that should be implemented to develop the Directive 
2010/31/EU of 19 May 2010 on the energy performance 
of buildings (in particular regarding self-consumption and 
zero emission buildings).
So far, there is no specific legislation concerning the 
increase of the share of energy from renewable sources 
in the building sector, but the Law on the structuring of 
areas under risk of natural disasters (Law No. 6306) (13) 
provides the legal framework for the principles and procedures of restructuring and reconstruction of urban areas at 
risk of natural disasters. Among other principles, the Law 
also sets out provisions concerning the implementation of 
restructuring of these areas.
One of the Strategical Purposes (SP) presented in the paper, SP-02, is directly related to buildings. The goal of this 
SP is “to decrease energy demand and carbon emissions 
of buildings; to promote sustainable environmentally 
friendly buildings using renewable energy sources”. 
Lastly, it is important to consider that the Turkish Government is committed to develop a National Energy Efficiency 
Action Plan (NEEAP) in the near future. Among others, the 
plan will include measures and actions to increase the share of energy from renewable sources in the building sector. 
Therefore, the points highlighted in this section are subject 
to modification in accordance with the new NEEAP.
b) Responsible Ministry(/ies)/authority(/ies)
Regarding the Law on structuring of areas under risk 
of natural disasters (Law No. 6306) (13), the responsibilities 
would fall under the duties of the Ministry of Environment 
and Urbanization (ÇŞB). For the measures proposed in 
the Energy Efficiency Strategy Paper, the responsibilities 
mentioned in the document concern the Ministry of 
Environment and Urbanization for ST-01 and the Ministry 
of Energy and Natural Resources (ETKB) for ST-02.
c) Revision of rules, if any, are planned by:
At the moment, the majority of possible measures are 
not currently in place. Nevertheless, a period between 12 
and 36 months has been established for revisions, consultation and preparation for the bill to pass in Parliament. 
Although the measures themselves do not include any 
revision, it is likely that during this development period 
that measures will be completed, reviewed and finalized, 
including any possible future revision of the rules.d) Summary of the existing and planned measures at 
regional/local levels:
The abovementioned measures do not include any 
specific modification at regional/local level. Nonetheless, 
some of them (e.g. SP-02/ST-01/A-01) account for differences according to regions (such as climate conditions). 
Therefore, this could be seen as encompassing planned 
measures at a regional/local level. 
e) Are there any minimum levels for the use of renewable energy in building regulations and codes? 
In which geographical areas and what are these 
requirements? (Please summarize.) In particular, what 
measures have been built into these codes to ensure 
the share of renewable energy used in the building 
sector will increase? What are the future plans related 
to these requirements/measures?
The existence of the regulation regarding unlicensed 
generation for electricity, including the availability of feedin tariff mechanisms for the excess generation, is regarded 
as the sole most important incentive for buildings; therefore a further incentive mechanism is not on the agenda 
at the time of writing this report, although it could change 
with the development of the new NEEAP.
The table with the increase of renewable energy use in 
buildings is not included here because of the coming 
NEEAP. The development of the future NEEAP will place 
Turkey in a better position to forecast the penetration of 
renewable energy in buildings.
f) Have obligations for minimum levels of renewable 
energy in new and newly refurbished buildings been 
considered in national policy? If so, what are these levels? If not, how will the appropriateness of this policy 
option be explored by 2015?
SP-02/ST-01/A-01 of the Energy Efficiency Strategy 
Paper establishes the minimum annual energy demand 
covering the areas of heating, cooling, lighting, etc., will 
be determined according to the different characteristics 
of the buildings and based on energy requirements and 
emission limitations.
 The Building Energy Performance Specification shall be revised with all of its sub-arrangements within 36 months of the 
date of publication of the Energy Efficiency Strategy Paper 
(July 2, 2012) and the necessary standards shall be defined.
g) Please describe plans for ensuring the exemplary 
role of public buildings at national, regional and local 
level by using renewable energy installations or becoming zero energy buildings from 2012 onwards? (Please take into account the requirements under the EPBD).
Apart from the plans already commented on in previous 
points, and the measures to be pointed out in the future NEEAP, there is a specific Strategical Purpose, SP-06, on the Energy Efficiency Strategy Paper that deals with public buildings: 
“To use energy effectively and efficiently in the public sector”. 
The plans proposed under that SP ensure the exemplary role 
of public buildings by using renewable energy installations.
h) How are energy efficient renewable energy technologies in buildings promoted?
The proposed package of measures presented in this 
chapter promotes energy efficient renewable energy technologies in buildings. Given that the measures/actions are due 
to come into force in the short/medium term (1 or 2 years) 
the promotion would be guaranteed.
Moreover, SP-07 aims at strengthening institutional 
structures, capacities and collaboration to increase use 
of state of the art technology, awareness activities and to 
develop financial mechanisms. The lines of action include 
the following topics: strengthen corporate structures and 
collaborations, training programs, R&D, agreements with 
consultancy companies, and communication and consciousness in the community. All these action lines would 
promote energy efficiency.4.2.4 Information provisions (Articles 14(1), 14(2) and 
14(4) of Directive 2009/28/EC) 
In a similar way to previous chapter, this section is built on 
existing plans. 
a) Reference to existing national and or regional legislation (if any) concerning information requirements 
according to Article 14 of Directive 2009/28/EC.
Information and public awareness are two key points 
when it comes to the promotion of renewable energy. 
One of the Strategic Purposes proposed in the Energy Efficiency Strategy Paper, SP-07, covers this kind of campaign.
So far, the existing legislation concerning information provision has been mentioned. In addition, new mechanisms will 
be studied during the development of the Turkish NEEAP.
b) Responsible body/(ies) for dissemination of information at national/regional/local levels.
According to the Energy Efficiency Strategy Paper, the 
responsible bodies/entities for the dissemination of information are ETKB, the public sector and General Directorate 
of Renewable Energy. In addition, collaboration with the 
private sector and NGOs will be required in order to come 
up with an effective information campaign.
c) Summary of existing and planned activities at a 
regional/local level (where applicable).
There are no concrete activities scheduled so far. Plans 
detailing communication and ways to develop awareness 
shall be conducted under the recommendations set by the 
two actions (SP-07/ST-04/A-01 and SP-07/ST-04/A-02) previously presented. The framework for this communication 
campaign shall be prepared within 12 months of the date 
of the publication of the paper and shall be applied within 
three years of that date, at most.
General Directorate of Renewable Energy should design a 
campaign with local and regional authorities to provide information on support measures to encourage the penetration of renewable energy (in particular, distributed generation based on renewable energy and renewable energy in 
buildings) to all relevant players, such as consumers, builders, 
installers, architects, and suppliers of heating, cooling and 
electricity equipment and systems and of vehicles compatible with the use of energy from renewable sources.
This information program should ensure that information on the net benefits, cost and energy efficiency of 
equipment and systems for the use of heating, cooling 
and electricity from renewable energy sources is made 
available either by the supplier of the equipment or sys
bhGl Dif RblE
Regarding certification schemes or equivalent qualification schemes, information will be provided on the 
installation of small-scale biomass boilers and stoves, solar 
photovoltaic and solar thermal systems, shallow geothermal systems and heat pumps. Those schemes may take 
into account existing schemes and structures as appropriate, and shall be based on the criteria laid down.
d) Please indicate how information is made available 
on supporting measures for using renewable energy sources in electricity, heating and cooling and in 
transport to all relevant actors (consumers, builders, 
installers, architects, suppliers of relevant equipment 
and vehicles). Who is responsible for the adequacy 
and the publishing of this information? Are there 
specific information resources for the different target 
groups, such as end consumers, builders, property 
managers, property agents, installers, architects, 
farmers, suppliers of equipment using renewable 
energy sources, public administration? Are there 
information campaigns or permanent information 
centres in the present, or planned in the future?
The General Directorate of Renewable Energy is the 
main authority for collecting, analyzing and disseminating 
the information in the domain of energy efficiency and 
renewable energy. General Directorate of Renewable 
Energy’s website is the ultimate source of information, 
open to the public, on the different groups of energy 
users. All relevant campaigns, regulations (including both 
incentives and obligations) and recommendations with 
case studies are available on the General Directorate of 
Renewable Energy’s website.
Furthermore, all the primary and secondary regulations are 
available to the public through the Official Gazette, which 
is published both in print and on the web on a daily basis.
From 2008, which was the “Year of the Energy Efficiency”, 
General Directorate of Renewable Energy initiated numerous public campaigns raising awareness in different sectors (Mrs. Energy; ENVER, and the like) and details about 
these campaigns are available on the web and on separate websites linked to General Directorate of Renewable 
Energy’s main site. 
The previous points of this chapter have detailed the 
specific measures proposed to carry out the information 
process within its specified dates.e) Who is responsible for publishing information on 
the net benefits, costs and energy efficiency of equipment and systems using renewable energy sources 
for heating, cooling and electricity? (Supplier of the 
equipment or system, public body or someone else?)
In Turkey, the Ministry of Energy and Resources is the 
ultimate owner and entity responsible for disseminating 
all energy related information and manages this responsibility through one of its divisions specializing in Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency, which is the General 
Directorate of Renewable Energy. Thus General Directorate 
of Renewable Energy, as mentioned in the above item, disseminates information on the internet which includes, but 
is not limited to, the benefits, costs and energy efficiency 
of equipment and systems using renewable energy sources for heating, cooling and electricity in a broad sense. 
Some academic institutions which have departments 
specializing in energy efficiency (e.g. Istanbul Technical 
University, Laboratory for Energy Efficiency and Lighting), 
some NGOs such as the Chamber of Mechanical Engineers, the Association of Energy Efficiency (ENVER) are 
also important entities that publish well researched and 
thoroughly analyzed information specifically on the net 
benefits, costs and energy efficiency of equipment and 
systems using renewable energy sources for heating, 
cooling and electricity. It is expected with the growing 
emphasis on efficiency from the General Directorate of 
Renewable Energy, that collaboration from the private 
sector and NGOs will be further increased.
f) How is guidance for planners and architects provided 
to help them to properly consider the optimal combination of renewable energy sources, high efficiency 
technologies and district heating and cooling when 
planning, designing, building and renovating industrial 
or residential areas? Who is responsible for that?
There is no one distinct entity responsible for this purpose: however, the Chamber of Mechanical Engineers has been 
taking various steps including organizing training events, raising awareness through diverse activities and has developed 
such things as reports, studies, information packets, surveys 
and the like. The Chamber of Architects and the Chamber of 
Civil Engineers are greatly interested in energy efficiency in 
buildings and have been involved in several training campaigns focusing on energy efficient design and implementation. Some architecture companies have certifications for 
energy efficient design (both for LEED and BREEAM).
Furthermore, the Government suggests that in the 
medium term the Turkish Renewable Energy Training and 
Education Plan should focus on improving professional 
technical skills in this field. One of the most important 
lif iill bhdlfi
integration in buildings. The design of the program by the 
Ministry of National Education with the collaboration of 
the Ministry of the Environment and Urbanization and the 
Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources will be beneficial.
In addition, with contribution of some NGOs there are 
currently studies to adapt an environmental certificate 
system for buildings specific to the geographical, climatic, 
political, social and technological context of Turkey. The 
association is also working on the evaluation of the environmental impacts of buildings and their surroundings 
aiming for a green transformation of construction industry.
g) Please describe the existing and planned information, awareness raising and training programs for 
citizens on the benefits and practicalities of developing and using energy from renewable sources. What 
is the role of regional and local actors in the designing 
and managing these programs?
Currently, “Mrs. Energy” and “ENVER” are the largest 
public campaigns intended to create public awareness in 
Turkey. Mrs. Energy was launched in 2013 and is designed 
to promote awareness of energy efficiency in the home 
along with training regarding the implementation of basic 
efficiency principles. ENVER, which was created in 2008, 
is intended to reach a wide range of different people and 
sectors within Turkey, including the industrial sector as 
well as public buildings. The leader in these campaigns is 
the Energy Efficiency Association, which was officially established through the involvement of General Directorate 
of Renewable Energy and is now led by the CEOs of some 
of the largest companies in Turkey.
4.2.5 Certification of installers (Article 14(3)
of Directive 2009/28/EC)
a) Reference to existing national and/or regional 
legislation (if any) concerning certification or equivalent qualification plans for installers according to 
Article 14(3) of the Directive 2009/28/EC.
Certification and qualification plans with regards to 
training are considered under Strategic Purpose 7 (SP07) of the Energy Efficiency Strategy Paper. The overall 
objective of this ST is “to strengthen institutional capacities and collaborations, to increase the use of state of 
the art technology and awareness, to develop financial 
mechanisms with the exception of public financial 
institutions”.
Training and certification programs would fall within 
the strengthening of institutional capacities category. 
SP-07/ST-01/A-02 is focused on strengthening collaborations among the main players: the Ministry of Energy 
d Nl R(ETKB)hGl Dif Commodity Exchanges (TOBB) and the General Directorate of Efficiency (VGM). In this collaborative framework, 
energy audits, trainings and incentive contests within 
the industry shall be addressed.
Under the same target, SP-07/ST-01/A-03 points out the 
need for training programs for the staff of construction 
supervisory companies and local authorities. 
b) Responsible body/(ies) for setting up and authorizing certification/qualification schemes by 2012 for 
installers of small-scale biomass boilers and stoves, 
solar photovoltaic and solar thermal systems, shallow 
geothermal systems and heat pumps.
There is no specific authorization however, generally 
the following parties relevant for the topic are Energy and 
Natural Resources (ETKB), the Ministry of Environment and 
Urbanization (ÇŞB), the General Directorate of Renewable 
Energy and the local authorities (YY).
Today, there is no distinction among the different systems 
(small-scale biomass boilers and stoves, solar photovoltaic 
and solar thermal systems, shallow geothermal systems 
and heat pumps) although this may change in the forthcoming period.
c) Are such certification schemes/qualifications already in place? If so, please describe.
The General Directorate of Renewable Energy has 
authorized (and will authorize in the future) a number of 
Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) to engage in energy 
efficiency implementations, specialized in either or both 
industrial and residential energy efficiency (14). However, 
certification plans for small-scale biomass boilers and 
stoves, solar photovoltaic and solar thermal systems, 
shallow geothermal systems and heat pumps are not 
yet in place. The measures contained in the Energy 
Efficiency Strategy Paper are due to be enacted in the 
short/medium term. For the specific measures presented 
above: SP-07/ST-01/A-02, SP-07/ST-01/A-03 and SP-07/
ST-02/A-01, the period shall be 12, 24 and 6 months 
respectively starting from the July 2, 2012.
d) Is information on these schemes publicly available? 
Are lists of certified or qualified installers published? 
If so, where? Are other schemes accepted as equivalent to the national/regional scheme?
A list of residential and industrial ESCOs, authorized by 
General Directorate of Renewable Energy, regarding the 
relevant regulations are published on the General Directorate of Renewable Energy’s website.
e) Summary of the existing and planned measures at 
regional/local levels (where relevant).
There are various effprts going on with the participation of chamber of industry, academia, local municipalities, 
development agencies and NGOs in several cities.
4.2.6 Electricity infrastructure development
a) Reference to existing national legislation concerning 
requirements related to the energy grids (Article 16).
In the medium term, it is advisable for TEİAŞ to update the grid codes to enable large renewable energy 
penetration according to security and energy reliability 
criteria. The following procedures, among others may 
be engaged: secondary and tertiary reserves, voltage 
control, curtailment, and control and monitoring of 
renewable energy facilities. TEİAŞ will update its technology to be able to control, monitor and manage a large 
grid penetration of wind and solar energy.
Additionally, the legal framework to develop distributed 
generation based on renewables, among others;
• Connection to the grid, 
• Balancing in distributed systems (ancillary services, 
operation criteria, reverse power flows and active 
demand management, storage, curtailing and smart 
metering processes linked to the balancing (15)) 
• And signaling (data exchange with distribution generation and/or consumption, signals among sensors 
and metering). 
It may be composed of the mentioned procedures. In 
addition, a revenue model for auto-consumption may be 
defined.
Finally, the Turkish Government may evaluate in the 
medium term and establish a coordination scheme for the 
DNOs which will enable connection of distributed generation considering reduction of losses and the economic 
benefits due to renewable energy (with regards to the 
mitigation of energy dependency).
b) How is it ensured that transmission and distribution 
grids will be developed with a view to integrating the 
targeted amount of renewable electricity while maintaining the secure operation of the electricity system? How 
is this requirement included in the transmission and 
distribution operators’ periodical network planning?
The development of transmission and distribution 
grids is ensured thanks to the update of the abovemen
id dAdditionally, TEİAŞ has a commitment to update the transmission infrastructure for future needs. Figure 20 depicts the 
adaptation scheme. In medium term, TEİAŞ will elaborate 
the grid expansion plan for the period 2015-2020 taking into 
consideration the forecast penetration of renewable energy.
For the System Operator, an incentive scheme (revenue model) based on renewable energy penetration and the positive 
externalities derived from renewable energy will be designed.
c) What will be the role of intelligent networks, information technology tools and storage facilities? How 
will their development be ensured?
The penetration of renewable energy at the distribution level requires the implementation of new solutions 
based on intensive usage of information and telecommunication technologies. In order to encourage electricity 
distribution operators to facilitate renewable energy 
penetration, the Turkish Government will evaluate in the 
medium term the possibility of establishing incentives for 
the DNOs, which will enable connections to sources of distributed generation while also taking into consideration 
the reduction of losses and economic benefits (including 
mitigation of energy dependency).
Pumped-storage hydroelectricity research in Turkey was 
initially started by EIE in the year 2009. Japanese expertise was 
received for PSH systems in combination with wind energy 
generation. A projection of Turkey’s peak energy demand was 
also included in the scope of the project. 
Conceptual designs were created for the Gökçekaya 
and the Altınkaya HEPPs, rating 278 MW and 700 MW 
respectively, for possible PSH system implementation. 
Currently, there is a project in progress regarding the mitigation of the negative effects of wind energy generation on the grid with the utilization of PSH systems. It is 
located in the Yahyalı district of Kayseri. The project will 
consist of 4 MW PSH and 4x2.5 MW wind turbines.
Turkey indeed realizes the importance of large scale energy 
storage for a reliable grid. Even though studies are conducted 
by governmental organizations, Turkey offers tremendous benefits to investors to utilize the ample sources of hydropower.
d) Is the reinforcement of the interconnection capacity with neighboring countries planned? If so, which 
interconnectors, for which capacity and by when?
Turkish authorities are aware of the need for interconnection reinforcement not only to increase renewable 
energy penetration, but also to guarantee security of 
supply, increasing at the same time the quality and the 
reliability of the supply.
In the Resources Strategic Plan (2010-2014), published by 
the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (5), the Strategic Theme-2 emphasized the need to establish Turkey’s 
regional and global influence in the energy sector. The 
plan also stated that the Government has applied policies 
for contributing to the supply security of electricity and for 
supplying adequate energy without any interruption and 
at a high level of quality. Importance is also being given to 
interconnections with neighboring countries bilaterally 
and as multi-parties (i.e. regional).
Currently, the following international interconnections are in 
place and detailed in Figure 21.

development in the medium term.
e) How is the acceleration of grid infrastructure authorization procedures addressed? What is the current state and 
average time for getting approval? How will it be improved? (Please refer to current status and legislation, bottlenecks detected and plans to streamline procedure with 
timeframe of implementation and expected results.)
All power plants above 1 MW apply to EPDK for licensing and EPDK sends the project details to TEİAŞ for its 
approval to gain grid access for those plants that want to 
connect to 154 kV or 380 kV. For connections on a middle 
voltage level, the regional distribution authority provides 
consent or denial. TEİAŞ checks the possible transformation center to which the plant would connect and checks 
the availability of capacity and sends its consent or denial 
back to EPDK. If the power plants get its license, the investor applies to TEİAŞ to sign a “System Use Agreement”. This 
procedure could take time and changes from project to 
project can be necessary.
Additionally, in order to avoid the main problem regarding 
the management of these procedures, the delays in the 
process, a maximum time scope should be established to 
the grid infrastructure authorization procedure, e.g. three 
months. On the other hand, to improve the quality of the service provided by the system operator to the promoters, a call 
center should be established to manage all the information 
regarding grid access of these facilities in a centralized way: 
this mechanism would facilitate the communication to the 
applicants and will reduce the interruptions in the technical 
assessments (avoid/reduce the need to contact the technician to acquire information about the applications state). 
f) How is horizontal coordination facilitated between 
different administrative bodies, responsible for the 
different parts of the permit?
The Research, Planning and Coordination Department of TEİAŞ plans the location, length and necessary investments for new transmission lines or a capacity 
in the relevant year’s investment plan and approved by 
the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources and the 
Ministry of Development.
After the necessary approvals are complete, TEİAŞ conducts land use studies for the properties that are within 
the territories of the planned facilities. Permits are filed 
with the relevant departments of TEİAŞ including – allocation for non-agriculture use of land, permits for forested 
areas, removal of meadow feature, permits for protected 
areas, permits from the State Hydraulic Works, the City 
Health Directorates and the City Environmental Directorates, etc. – and after completion of the permits, expropriation procedures can begin. TEİAŞ lists the properties 
concerned and determines the value of the properties. If 
necessary, TEİAŞ may ask for the opinion of the related tax 
and deed offices and the local chamber of industry and 
trade. Generally, the judicial and the transfer process ends 
in two or three months, if the parties agree on the expropriation; however, the whole process of getting the approval from all relevant parties takes a considerable amount 
of time depending on the parties involved. All information 
flow is done through official letters, and this extends until 
the start of construction. Once the approvals are complete 
and the construction has started, construction work is 
conducted according to the plan.
The different parties involved in the process of granting 
permission are: TEİAŞ, the Ministry of Energy and Natural 
Resources, the Ministry of Development, the Ministry of 
Forestry and Hydraulic Works, the Ministry of the Environment and Urbanization, the Ministry of Finance, the State 
Hydraulic Works, the City Health Directorates, the City 
Environmental Directorates, the Chamber of Industry and 
Trade, the Judiciary, etc.
In order to improve horizontal coordination between 
the different bodies in charge of granting the permit, a 
one-stop-shop approach would be ideal. It would have a 
two-fold objective: one is to facilitate the communication 
between the different administrative bodies involved, 
the other to simplify the administrative burden on the 
applicant side. A call center should be established to 
manage all the information in a centralized way: this mechanism would facilitate the communication between the 
applicants and the different organizations; with only one 
contact point (in just one call/visit to a site) the applicant 
could consult the state of all the requirements linked to 
the application (or manage them).
Interconnection Lines
Turkey - Iraq
Turkey – Syria
Turkey – Iran
Construction for a 400 kV interconnection line from Cizre 
(Turkey) and Musul (Iraq) is on-going.
Investments in this project are expected to be completed 
by 2013.
According to feasibility studies, a 500 MW back-to-back DC 
link has been planned to be built.
In order to increase the current transmission capacity of 
400 kV between Birecik (Turkey) and Halep (Syria) a 600 MW 
back-to-back DC facility is planned.
600 MW back-to-back DC with a 400 kV is planned. 
Figure 22: Planned international grid interconnections to be
developed in the short/medium termg) Are priority connection rights or reserved connection capacities provided for new installations producing electricity from renewable energy sources?
According to the Law on the Utilization of Renewable 
Energy Resources for the Purpose of Generating Electrical Energy, when EPDK evaluates license applications, 
renewable resource based generation facilities shall be 
prioritized in connection to the grid.
However, the same Law states that until December 31, 
2013, 600 MW at most of solar power plants can be connected to the system. After this date, the capacity at which solar 
generation facilities can be connected shall be announced 
by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources every year. 
Similar to solar based generation facilities, wind power 
plants cannot be connected to the system randomly. The 
Ministry determines the maximum capacity that can be connected to the grid and announces that capacity periodically. 
In regards to the capacity announced – for both solar and 
wind – if there are more applications requesting connection, 
a competition (tender) shall be conducted in order to determine the generators that will be connected to the grid.
In practice, there are connection capacities reserved for 
new installations producing electricity from wind and solar.
In 2007, there were a total of 751 wind power plant applications to EPDK rated at 78,000 MW and TEİAŞ was asked 
for connection rights, as well as restrictions of these wind 
turbines. TEİAŞ projected a peak demand of 48,000 MW for 
2013 and has allocated 12,000 MW for the connection of 
wind power plants.
Additional Transformer Substations (TS) with 380 kV were 
planned to be built in areas where wind potential was high, 
and the number of applications received was also high. The 
following TS are included in the Investment Program and 
capacities have been announced for these regions:
• Izmir Havza TS in Izmir.
• Can Havza TS and Gelibolu Havza in Canakkale.
• Vize Havza TS in Kırklareli.
• Catalca Havza in Istanbul.
For wind power plant applications that were not in the 
areas of TS, applications were evaluated as single applications and were provided 2,000 MW of capacity. For 
wind power plant applications that applied for the same 
TS region, they were evaluated as multiple-applications, 
which resulted in a competition for connection of the 
wind power plants. There were a total of 13 competitions 
diid liiliil lli
tion for 87 connection points. 147 companies that had 
proposed the highest price per kWh were awarded system 
connection rights. 
After the completion of the competitions, a contribution 
fee was signed between TEİAŞ and the winners. Connection agreements were made for companies that acquired 
their licenses from EPDK.
A 5% restriction of Short Circuit for connecting wind turbines into the connection point was removed in January, 
2013 with the amendment of the Regulation Regarding 
Supply Security and Quality for Electricity Transmission. 
TEİAŞ announced a total of 600 MW capacity that can 
be connected to the grid by December 31, 2013. Applications for solar power plants were received by EPDK 
between the June 10 and 14, 2013. In case of land/regional crossings between the applicants for solar power 
plants, TEİAŞ will organize competitions compatible with 
the Electricity Market Law for solar power and capacities 
will be allocated.
h) Are any renewable installations ready to come online but not connected due to capacity limitations of 
the grid? If so, what steps are taken to resolve this and 
by when is it expected to be solved?
Currently, there does not exist any installation ready 
to come online, which has not been connected due to 
capacity limitations of the grid.
The procedure to access to the grid depends on the 
renewable energy technology:
• Regarding the procedures in wind and solar, the licensing is based on tender procedures. 
• The rest of technologies can apply directly to the 
system operator for access to the grid.
The criteria to allocate capacity depend on the limits of 
connectable capacity to the available transformers, and the 
application of the grid codes with reference to the following 
topics: overload of the circuits, voltage control (over/under 
voltage), frequency control and application of N-1 criteria.i) Are the rules on cost sharing and bearing of grid technical adaptations set up and published by transmission and distribution system operators? If so, where? 
How is it ensured that these rules are based on objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria? Are 
there special rules for producers located in peripheral 
regions and regions with low population density?16
The legal and regulatory rules that have been defined for 
the transmission network have established, in general terms, 
that the internal development of the network is supported 
by tariffs paid by consumers. TEİAŞ is responsible for building 
the transmission infrastructure and for those cases where 
TEİAŞ is unable to build the transmission line from the power 
plant to the transformer in a timely manner, the power plant 
investor may build the line and deduct it from the system 
usage and system operation fees which are payable to TEİAŞ 
for the first 10 years after commissioning. Payback is on a 
monthly basis. The payback amount is calculated by TEİAŞ 
based on a fixed methodology. The rules are those published by TEİAŞ in the form of announcements and secondary 
regulations and are available on the TEİAŞ website in detail.
In case the investor did not have the total cost of the transmission line covered in the first 10 years through these 
deductions, TEİAŞ pays the remaining portion of the investment in one cash payment at the end of the 10 years.
The level of system use is actually announced by TEİAŞ, 
but escalation within the Consumer Price Index is used 
for forecasting future values. The Electricity Market Law 
Provisional Article 14: For plants commissioned until 
December 31, 2015, a 50% discount on the system usage 
fee is applicable. Although the date is announced as 2015, 
this can be further postponed by policymakers. The date is 
now extended until 2020.
j) Please describe how the costs of connection and 
technical adaptation are attributed to producers and/or 
transmission and/or distribution system operators? How 
are transmission and distribution system operators able 
to recover these investment costs? Is any modification 
of these costs bearing rules planned in the future? What 
changes do you envisage and what results are expected?
The transmission and distribution system operators 
are responsible for reinforcing and expanding the electricity network, and supporting the resulting costs. These 
costs are integrated into the network tariffs and are paid 
for by the customers.
16. Cost bearing rules define which part of the costs is covered by the 
generator wishing to be connected and which part by the transmission or 
distribution system operatorCost sharing rules define how the necessary 
In turn, electricity producers are responsible for connecting 
their production plant to the electricity network and are only 
responsible for the costs associated with building this link.
The operator of the transmission network recovers its 
investments by means of the network tariff, in the same 
way as in the case of any other investment that it makes in 
the network it operates.
However, if it is necessary to reinforce the grid infrastructure, this can be done by the grid operator or the renewable 
energy investor. In the first case, the grid operator recovers 
the investment with the tariff, while in the second case 
the investor develops the infrastructure; the investment is 
recovered in 10 years through system use and the operation fee as described in the above section.
k) How will it be ensured that transmission and distribution system operators provide new producers wishing 
to be connected with the necessary information on 
costs, a precise timetable for processing their requests 
and an indicative timetable for their grid connection?
Regulations regarding license applications for solar 
and wind energy and their connection to the grid have 
been prepared and published in the Official Gazette.
On one hand, before connecting the facilities to grids 
meetings are held between the grid operator and the 
investor: they discuss the grid capacity, the costs and the 
timeframe for connection to the grid.
On the other hand, to encourage the penetration of a 
distributed generation based on renewables in distribution grids, the Turkish Government will evaluate, in 
the medium term, the establishment of an economic 
incentive for the DNOs based on the level of renewable 
energy within its grid. The economic incentive should be 
established according to the benefits of this integration: 
reduction of losses, economic benefits due to renewable 
energy and mitigation energy dependency, etc.
4.2.7 Electricity network operation (Article 16(2) and 
Article 16(7) and (8) of Directive 2009/28/EC)
a) How is the transmission and distribution of electricity from renewable energy sources guaranteed by 
transmission and distribution system operators? Is 
priority or guaranteed access ensured?
The Law on the Utilization of Renewable Energy Resources for the Purpose of Generating Electrical Energy (Law No: 
5346) (7) establishes that the distribution companies holding 
retail licenses are obligated to purchase the excess electricity 
generated by the unlicensed renewable energy generators 
ilfdiiff iRfii426() b)How is it ensured that transmission system operators, when dispatching electricity generating 
installations give priority to those using renewable 
energy sources?
The Law on the Utilization of Renewable Energy 
Resources for the Purpose of Generating Electrical Energy 
(Law No: 5346) clearly establishes this priority.
Further, TEİAŞ has been appointed to update its technology to be able to control, monitor and manage a large grid 
penetration of wind and solar energy.
Due to the large scale penetration of renewable energies 
with high levels of volatility that can produce problems of 
reliability and security in the electricity system, in the medium term a curtailment procedure for renewable energy 
will be established to avoid legal uncertainty.
c) How are grid- and market-related operational 
measures taken in order to minimize the curtailment 
of electricity from renewable energy sources? What 
kinds of measures are planned and when is implementation expected?
Grid operation procedures will be updated to enable 
large renewable energy penetration, including: secondary and tertiary reserves, voltage control, curtailment, 
and control and monitoring of renewable energy facilities. Additionally, curtailment procedures will be defined 
for the distribution grid to enable the penetration of 
distributed generation, and guarantee the security and 
reliability of the system.
TEİAŞ will implement technology solutions to monitor and 
manage large renewable energy penetration in the grid.
Finally, an increase of international interconnections to 
export excess production and to improve the reliability of 
the system will take place in the short/medium term.
d) Is the energy regulatory authority informed about 
these measures? Does it have the competence to monitor and enforce implementation of these measures?
In Turkey, EPDK, as the regulatory authority, is fully informed on the plans, actions, measures and possible implications of the measures both planned and in progress in the 
domain of energy. EPDK has the authority to monitor and to 
execute the applications for the aforementioned measures.
e) Are plants generating electricity from renewable 
energy sources integrated in the electricity market? 
Could you please describe how? What are their obligations regarding participation in the electricity market?
Plants generating electricity from renewable energy

different corporate entity, EPİAŞ, that is in the preparation 
phase while this report is being submitted. Generating 
plants are able to be involved in the bilateral agreements 
with eligible consumers or wholesalers and also benefit 
from the feed-in tariff mechanism. 
f) What are the rules for charging transmission and 
distribution tariffs to generators of electricity from 
renewable energy sources?
The end user pays the distribution tariff and the generator bears the transmission cost, payable to TEİAŞ.
4.2.8 Biogas integration into the natural gas network 
(Article 16(7) and Article 16(9) and (10) of Directive 
2009/28/EC)
g) How is it ensured that the charging of transmission 
and distribution tariffs does not discriminate against 
gas from renewable energy sources?
At the moment there is no such mechanism.
h) Has any assessment been carried out on the need 
to extend the gas grid infrastructure to facilitate the 
integration of gas from renewable sources? What is 
the result? If not, will there be such an assessment?
At the moment there is no such assessment.
i) Are technical rules on grid connection and connection tariffs for biogas published? Where are these 
rules published?
At the moment there are no such rules.
4.2.9 District heating and cooling infrastructure development (Article 16(11) of Directive 2009/28/EC)
a) Please provide an assessment of the need for new district heating and cooling infrastructure using renewable energy sources and contributing to the 2023 target. 
Based on this assessment, are there plans to promote 
such infrastructure in the future? What are the expected 
contributions of large biomass, solar and geothermal 
facilities in the district heating and cooling systems?
At the moment, there are no planned short term 
efforts for new district heating and cooling infrastructure 
using renewable energy sources. 
However, geothermal and biomass resources have the 
potential of being used in district heating and cooling (the 
proven geothermal capacity is 31,500 MWt).4.2.10 Biofuels and other bioliquids – sustainability 
criteria and verification of compliance 21 of Directive 
2009/28/EC.
a) How will the sustainability criteria for biofuels and 
bioliquids be implemented at the national level? 
In terms of the sustainability of biofuels, the first concern 
is the availability of sufficient crops for food before generation of biofuels, and thus, these criteria will be implemented 
through a gradual introduction of biofuels into the fuel mix 
without compromising the food requirements of the country. This sustainability concern has just led the government to 
revise the biodiesel obligation as the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock warning and the Ministry of Energy and 
Resources on the problem of insufficient and unsustainable 
local crops that are to be used for biodiesel generation rather 
than for use as food for the respective year.
A set of obligations for biofuel and bioethanol has already 
been established in order to guarantee this progressive 
integration. The plan is detailed in the next point (4.2.10.b) 
of this chapter.
b) How will it be ensured that biofuels and bioliquids 
that are counted towards the national renewable target, towards the national renewable energy obligations and/or are eligible for financial support comply 
with the sustainability criteria set down in Article 
17(2) to (5) of Directive 2009/28/EC?
The fulfillment of the sustainability criteria has been 
taken into account by the Energy Market Regulatory 
Authority. The decision of this authority was published in 
the Official Gazette on September, 27, 2011. 
The obligation for biodiesel content in diesel fuels 
that is produced from domestic agricultural products 
for road fuel supplied to the market is mandated to 
be at least 1% as of January 1, 2014, 2% as of January 
1, 2015, and 3% as of January 1, 2016. However, this 
obligation has been cancelled after a communiqué 
published by EPDK in the Official Gazette (No.28688) 
on June 25, 2013. EPDK by its mandate is fully involved in keeping track and providing opinions on these 
developments.
The obligation for bioethanol content in gasoline that is 
produced from domestic agricultural products for road fuel 
(petroleum) supplied to the market is mandated to be at 
least 2% as of January 1, 2013, and 3% as of January 1, 2014.
In the case of bioliquids, no measures have been established so far.
c) If a national authority/body will monitor the fulfillment of the criteria, does such a national authority/
body already exist? If so, please specify. If not, when is 
it envisaged to be established?
The national authority in charge of monitoring the 
fulfillment of the criteria is the Energy Market Regulatory 
Authority and it already exists. Furthermore, as the ultimate authority with the data, information and knowledge on the availability of crops and the food requirements 
of the country, the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and 
Livestock is involved in the process by providing input 
with regards to the viability of energy policies on crop 
based energy generation.
d) Please provide information on the existence of 
national law on land zoning and national land register for verifying compliance with Article 17(3) 
to (5) of Directive 2009/28/EC. How can economic 
operators have access to this information? (Please 
provide information on the existence of rules and 
distinction between different land statuses, like 
biodiversity area, protected area, etc.; and on the 
competent? national authority responsible who 
will monitor this land register and changes in 
land status.)
The table below (point 4.2.10.e) shows the different 
legislation related to biodiversity and protected areas.
e) As far as protected areas are concerned, please provide information under which national, European or 
international protection regimen they are classified.

Figure 23: Legislation and national authorityf) What is the procedure for changing the status of 
land? Who monitors and reports at the national level 
on land status changes? How often are land zoning registers updated (monthly, annually, bi-annually, etc.)?
In Turkey, for land that is within the borders of a municipality, the municipality has the right and responsibility 
of changing the land status through 5-year resettlement 
plans. For the others, the Ministry of Environment and 
Urbanization, and the General Directorate of Spatial Planning are in charge. 
The Municipality, the General Directorate of Land Registry 
and Cadaster and the provincial section of the Ministry of 
Environment and Urbanization keep the records on the 
status of land.
g) How is compliance with good agro-environmental 
practices and other cross-compliance requirements 
(required by Article 17(6) of Directive 2009/28/EC) 
ensured and verified at national level?
Dedicated non-food lignocellulosic energy crops, such 
as short rotation willow or miscanthus, grown on surplus 
agricultural land could provide additional feedstock for 
bioenergy production. Competing land use requirements for the food and livestock sector as well as land use 
conversion from agriculture to other uses determines the 
availability of agricultural land for energy crop production. Food demand in Turkey is expected to expand in 
the coming decades as a result of population growth and 
economic development.
However, 30% of agricultural land in Turkey is currently not 
used and it can be assumed that by 2020 one million hectares of degraded forests in Turkey can be used for lignocellulosic energy crop plantings with yields of 5 tonnes/ha. It would 
provide 2 Mtoe of bioenergy from the agricultural sector. 
h) Do you intend to help develop voluntary ‘certification’ plan(s) for biofuel and bioliquid sustainability as 
described in the second subparagraph of Article 18(4) 
of Directive 2009/28/EC? If so, how?
Currently, there is no voluntary certification plan for 
biofuel and bioliquid sustainability.
4.3 Plans to support and promote the use of
energy from renewable resources in electricity 
applied by Turkey
This section collects information from existing documents 
and plans regarding the use of energy from renewable 
resources in electricity. The National Energy Efficiency 
Action Plan (NEEAP) is meant to play an important role in 
the near future since energy transformation, transmission, 
distribution, and demand response issues will be covered.
Legislation
a) What is the legal basis for this obligation/target?
The Law on the Utilization of Renewable Energy Resources for the Purpose of Generating Electrical Energy (Law No: 
5346) (7) established an incentive plan for the promotion 
of renewable energy in Turkey, this plan was modified by 
the Law Amending the Utilization of Renewable Energy 
Resources in Electricity Generation (Law No: 6094) (8). The 
incentive is established in USD, and the licensees can only 
benefit from these tariffs during the first 10 years beginning 
on the date of operation and for facilities that are commissioned before the December 31, 2020.

Was published on 2007. 
ISBN: 978-605-393-030-3The Council of Ministers will determine the feed-in tariffs 
applicable to generation plants starting operation after 
the December 31, 2020 but such tariffs cannot exceed the 
rates already introduced by the Law.
Each year, the investor can choose between this feed-in 
tariff plan and direct sales in the power market.
In addition, an incentive to promote the use of local 
equipment has been established to promote the development of national industry.
The current feed-in tariff plan ends in 2020, therefore, an 
update of the plan would be needed. The new plan would 
take into consideration the following issues:
• Wind energy has a very challenging target17, which 
would be difficult to meet without taking necessary 
precautionary actions. There are many obstacles and 
the most critical ones include the following: Investors have difficulty in accessing financial support, as 
most financial providers take the feed-in tariff as the 
reference price for electricity (however, the forecasted 
market price is higher than this feed-in tariff ) and the 
forecasted project cash flow (based on feed-in tariffs) 
are not attractive enough for financial providers and 
guarantees are required creating a barrier for new 
generation facilities. The feasibility studies for the 
diversification of Feed-In-Tariff options depending on 
the geography and investment scale can be considered. Additionally, as described below a gradual 
Feed-In-Tariff can be applied in order to achieve the 
targeted installed capacity.
• Solar energy also has a significant target for 2023, 
5,000 MW should be installed by the end of 2023 
(currently, the penetration of solar technologies is only 
marginal). However, due to the evolution of solar PV 
technology, the investment cost has dropped during 
recent years. Therefore, together with the high availability of solar irradiation in Turkey, it would not be necessary to incentivize in the medium term to promote 
solar PV technology. Therefore, rather than the financial 
aspects, the main barrier to developing solar PV technologies in Turkey is linked to the 600 MW limitation 
introduced in Renewable Energy Law (No. 5346).
• Biomass energy has a low penetration rate in the 
country and its development depends on the current 
feed-in tariff in the medium term as well as the availability of raw materials, which depend on the type of 
technology.
• The current feed-in tariff plan established for hydropower and geothermal energy is appropriate for the 
feasibility of these investments.
The Government is evaluating the possibility to link the 
feed-in tariff to the necessary time to fulfill the targets (and 
the level of difficulty). The framework could be developed 
according to the following scheme:
1. A level of a renewable energy technology penetration target is established for a yearly period.
During this time, there would be a fixed feed-in tariff 
scheme (USD/MWh).
2. If the penetration target were fulfilled before the end 
of the period, a lower feed-in tariff scheme would be 
applied for the rest of the period and the next period.
3. If the penetration target were not fulfilled before 
the end of the period, an equal or higher feed-in tariff 
scheme would be applied for the rest of the period 
and the next period.
The incentive would be adapted dynamically to the level 
of renewable energy penetration: this mechanism would 
allow identifying the technologies that require less (or do 
not need) incentives. 
b) Are there any technology-specific targets? 
According to the Security of Supply Strategy Paper, the 
Strategic Plan of the ETKB and other policy declarations 
made by the Minister of Energy and Resources, the targets 
to promote the use of energy from renewable resources in 
electricity by 2023 are:
• Hydro: 34,000 MW
• Wind: 20,000 MW
• Geothermal18: 1,000 MW 
• Solar: 5,000 MW
• Biomass: 1,000 MWC) What are the concrete obligations/targets per year 
(per technology)? 19
19. National Renewable Energy Plan includes renewable and non-renewable hydro plants. It should be noted that according to the Renewable 
Energy Law, only power plants with less than 15 km2
 of reservoir area and 
the river-type hydroelectric power plants are considered as renewable

Fulfilling the obligations is a commitment of the 
Government of Turkey, and specifically, it is by the undersignature of the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources.
e) What is the consequence of non-fulfillment?
Consequences for the non-fulfillment of the renewable targets fall under several aspects, the most important 
of these are as follows:
1. Negative impact on the Turkish Current Account Balance: Regarding the higher dependence on imported 
energy sources (fossil fuels), the majority of which are 
imported at a considerable cost.
2. Negative impact in terms of energy dependency: 
The risk exposure of the Turkish economy to the volatility of fossil fuel prices will be higher and there will be 
higher risk exposure to the fossil fuel supply chain.
3. Negative impact on domestic industry and the 
economy: The large scale penetration of renewable 
energies according to current commitments will contribute to the industrial development of the country. It 
will be necessary to provide equipment, components 
and services to develop new infrastructure, most of 
these supplies will come from local providers.
4. Negative impact in opportunity cost terms: This 
means, the high availability of renewable energy 
resources in Turkey: wind, solar irradiation, geothermal capacity and hydro will be wasted when more 
expensive (not only in capital expenditures, but also 
regarding environmental and other macroeconomic 
impact) approaches are selected to solve the energy 
supply problem.
5. Negative environmental impact: The utilization of 
local and renewable sources creates less environmental 
hazard (waste, CO2
, etc.) and with less renewable contribution in the national generation mix, the environmental impact will be higher per MWh of energy generated.
f) Is there any mechanism to supervise fulfillment?
The General Directorate of Renewable Energy will monitor the development of the National Renewable Energy Plan.
The Plan will be evaluated at regular intervals through 
progress reports. It contains sector descriptions of developments, recommendations for appropriate adjustments, 
corrections and cost of recovery among the different 
renewable energy technologies. The progress report will 
be followed by an update of the Plan.
g) Is there any mechanism to modify obligations/targets?
The Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources can update the targets. Target adjustments are made in the context 
of the Plan’s revisions, mentioned in the previous point, f.
Specific questions for feed-in fixed tariffs
The current feed-in tariff scheme is established in the 
Law Amending the Law on the Utilization of Renewable 
Energy Resources in Electricity Generation (Law No: 6094). 
The feed-in tariff scheme has been introduced for the sale 
of electricity by generation facilities based on renewable 
energy resources according to following characteristics:
• It establishes a fixed price per kWh produced by 
renewable energy units (see the Figure 25). Every 
renewable technology, wind energy, solar, hydropower, 
biomass and geothermal, has its own level of feed-in 
tariff. The feed-in tariff is complemented with a bonus 
plan for power plants that utilize locally produced equipment (which fulfills current regulation on this point).
• Engaging in the feed-in tariff mechanism is not mandatory for the renewable energy power plants, rather, it 
is optional. Each year, until the October 31, the investor can apply to EPDK to engage in the feed-in tariff 
mechanism for the next calendar year. It is left to the 
preference of the investor, whether to sell the generation through a bilateral agreement, to the day-ahead 
market or to engage in the feed-in tariff mechanism. 
• Licensees can only benefit from these tariffs during 
the first 10 years from its opening date of operation. 
While the feed-in tariff is valid for the first 10 years 
following commissioning, the local equipment bonus 
plan is available to the investor for the first 5 years. 
• The current feed-in tariff time scope applies to facilities that 
start their operations before the December 31, 2020. 
• The new incentive was established in US Dollars (US 
Dollar cent/kWh), and is not subject to change or any 
kind of escalation.
The Council of Ministers will determine the sale tariffs 
applicable to generation plants starting operations after 
December 31, 2020, but such tariffs cannot exceed the 
rates defined above.As result of the abovementioned framework, the following 
Renewable Energy Resources Support Mechanism was 
published on November 1, 2011:
a) What are the conditions to get the fixed tariff?
The conditions to get the fixed tariff in Turkey are 
included in Article 6 of the Law No: 5346 (7) and amended 
by Law No: 6094 (8) in which the legal entities holding 
licenses to generate electricity from the renewable energy 
resources under the scope of this Law are subject to the 
following principles of implementation:
“Those wishing to be subjected to the RES Support Mechanism 
in the next calendar year are obliged to obtain RES Certificates 
and apply to the EPDK (Energy Market Regulatory Authority) 
until the October 31.
Time periods projected in the RES Support Mechanism shall 
commence as from the date of commissioning for those facilities under operation, and as from the date they will be commissioned for those facilities that are not yet under operating. 
Those subject to the RES Support Mechanism cannot leave the 
practice in the year they are included in the practice.
A list of those subject to the RES Support Mechanism and 
information on the commissioning dates, annual electrical energy production capacities and annual production 
programs of their facilities shall be published by the EPDK 
(Energy Market Regulatory Authority) until the 30th of every 
November, based on the types of resources.
The MFRC (Market Financial Reconciliation Center) shall 
announce the RES total amount for each invoice period and 
determine the payment obligation rate of each supplier. During the determination of the payment obligation rate, the 
amount of electrical energy produced from the Renewable 
Energy Resources within the scope of this Law and sold in the 
market without being subject to the RES Support Mechanism 
are not included in calculations within the scope herein. The 
amount that each supplier supplying the consumers with 
electrical energy is obliged to pay is calculated and invoiced 
to the supplier in question and the collections made are paid 
pro rata to the entities that are subject to the RES Support 
Mechanism. Principles and procedures concerning applica
id hiildihMFRC (MkFiil 
Reconciliation Center) shall be regulated with a regulation to 
be issued by the EPDK (Energy Market Regulatory Authority).
The annual production amount to be affixed on the licenses of facilities producing electrical energy from Renewable 
Energy Resources is the maximum annual amount that such 
facilities can produce with their existing installed capacity 
with their resources. And the licenses available on the date this 
article becomes valid shall be corrected in line with this within 
three months upon application of concerned parties.
Entities generating electrical energy from Renewable Energy 
Resources within the scope hereof and not intending to be 
subjected to the provisions of this article are allowed to make 
sales in the market within the scope of their licenses.”
b) Is there a cap on the total volume of electricity produced per year or of installed capacity that is entitled 
to the tariff?
Yes, TEİAŞ according to the provisional Article 17 of 
the Electricity Market License Regulation and in the scope of Article 23 of the Electricity Market Law (No.6446) 
will announce connection capacities for solar and wind 
energy depending on the connection point and/or for 
the five years following 2014 and the next ten years.
For solar energy, a specific limitation exists: The total 
installed capacities of production facilities based on RES 
Certified solar power to be connected until 31/12/2013 
may not be over 600 MW.
For wind energy capacity, TEİAŞ announced 3,000 MW 
limit for the years between 2014 and 2018.
For the rest of the technologies, there is no cap on the total volume of electricity produced per year or of installed 
capacity that is entitled to the tariff.

d) Are there other criteria differentiating tariffs?
There are differing prices for hydro, wind, solar, biomass 
and geothermal energy when the facilities are built using 
components manufactured domestically. The following 
tables detail the specific bonus for each technology.
e) For how long is the fixed tariff guaranteed?
As indicated in the above items, the fixed tariff is valid 
for 10 years from the date of the power plant’s commissioning. Law No: 6094 (8) specifies:
“Time periods stipulated in the RES Support Mechanism shall 
commence for facilities under operation from their date of 
commission and for facilities not yet operating from their date of 
commission. Those subject to the RES Support Mechanism shall 
not leave the practice in the year they are included in the practice.
A list of those subject to the RES Support Mechanism and 
information regarding commissioning dates, annual electrical energy production capacities and annual production

Figure 26: Incentive scheme for renewable energies to produce electricitySpecific questions on financial support to renewable
energy projects
Financial providers require guarantees from renewable energy investors and in some cases are reluctant to 
support projects, e.g. exploration in geothermal energy. 
Due to this reason, the current penetration of geothermal energy and the target for 2023 (1,000 MW) is very 
low in light of the potential within the country. In order 
to overcome this barrier in the short term, the Turkish 
Government is collaborating with the financial sector, and 
international financial institutions focused on economic 
development, and will analyze the possibility of enabling 
mechanisms to mitigate capital risk, in order to support 
geothermal exploration and drilling activities.
However, renewable energy investors (both large units 
and unlicensed facilities) have problems in accessing financial support and guarantees that are required by financial providers. In a similar fashion, the Turkish Government 
is collaborating with the financial sector, and international 
financial institutions for economic development and will 
analyze the possibility of enabling mechanisms to provide 
financial guarantees for renewable energy projects.
4.4 Plans to support and promote the use of 
energy from renewable resources in heating and 
cooling applied by Turkey 
The Energy Efficiency Strategy Paper (2012-2023) is a supporting document outlining how the country will achieve 
energy targets and facilitate the necessary changes in energy efficiency laws (4). The questions included in this chapter 
are answered based mainly on this document. Although, in 
a near future, the new NEEAP will play an important role in 
the promotion of renewable energy in heating and cooling. 
The report will include, among others, a comprehensive assessment of the potential for the application of high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling.
a) How are the support plans for electricity from 
renewable energy sources adapted to encourage the 
use of CHP from renewable energy sources?
Currently, there is no support plan for electricity from 
renewable energy sources adapted to encourage the 
use of CHP. Nevertheless, one of the purposes of the 
Energy Efficiency Strategy Paper (SP-02) is to define the 
measures that are proposed to decrease energy demand 
and CO2
 emissions of buildings, promoting at the same 
time the use of renewable energy sources. Specific actions are also defined to encourage the use of CHP from 
renewable energy sources.
b) What support plans are in place to encourage the 
use of district heating and cooling using renewable 
energy sources?
Currently, there is no support plan in place to encourage the use of district heating and cooling using 
renewable energy sources. However, under Strategical 
Purpose 02 (SP-02) of the Energy Efficiency Strategy 
Paper (2012-2023), “To decrease energy demand and 
carbon emissions of the buildings; to promote sustainable environmentally friendly buildings using renewable 
energy sources“.
c) What support plans are in place to encourage the 
use of small-scale heating and cooling from renewable energy sources?
Currently, there are no specific support plans in place 
to encourage the use of small-scale heating and cooling 
from renewable energy sources. Nevertheless, according 
to regulatory framework small-scale heating and cooling 
do not fall under the renewable energy category.
Regarding finance facility, the use of small-scale heating 
and cooling from renewable energy sources falls within 
the category of small-scale renewable energy projects. This 
is one of the credit lines supported by two institutions in 
order to promote sustainable energy.
First, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) launched the Turkey Sustainable Energy Financing Facility (TurSEFF) on the July 14, 2010, with a USD 
200 million credit line that is available for households and 
private enterprises. Apart from EBRD, in March of 2011, 
the Agence Française de Développement (AFD) launched the Climate Turkey Program. This program provides 
Halkbank (Türkiye Halk Bankası) with a €100 million credit 
line in order for the bank to be able to support small and 
medium enterprises through investment loans. Out of 
the €100 million granted by AFD to Halkbank, €60 million 
will support energy efficiency improvements in enterprises and €40 million will finance small-scale renewable 
energy production units.d) What support schemes are in place to encourage 
the use of heating and cooling from renewable energy sources in industrial applications?
Under Strategical Purpose 01 (SP-01) of the Energy 
Efficiency Strategy Paper (2012-2023), “To reduce energy 
intensity and energy losses in the industrial and services 
sectors”, a Strategical Target (ST) is defined with the goal of 
decreasing energy intensities at a rate determined in collaboration with the sector. The SP has one ST, ST-01, with 4 
actions, which are due to be applied within 12 months of 
the date of the publication of the document.
SP-01/ST-01/A-01 and SP-01/ST-01/A-03 deal with energy 
audits in certain industries every 4 years in order to test the 
application of the plans and measures in place. Therefore, if 
heating and cooling measures were promoted in Turkey, these audits would be able to check the scope of their fulfillment.
SP-01/ST-01/A-02 establishes the need to obtain an 
Energy Management System Standard, ISO 50001, in 
the industrial and services sectors. On the other hand, 
SP-01/ST-01/A-04 promotes the development of studies 
to provide additional support mechanisms to increase energy efficiency. Heating and cooling systems fall 
within this category too.
Legislation
a) What is the legal basis for this obligation/target?
The legal basis for the use of energy from renewable 
resources in heating and cooling will be set by the Strategical Purposes, Targets and Actions mentioned above. 
These measures are not in place yet, but the changes 
shall be made in the framework of the legislation and 
enactment of these measures is due to take place soon. 
The period varies according to the actions. The range is 
from 12 to 36 months from the publication of the Energy 
b) Are there any technology-specific targets? 
The targets for 2023 only include 606.2 ktoe of 
geothermal solutions. There are no specific numerical 
targets for solar, biomass or heat pumps.
c) What are the concrete obligations/targets per year 
(per technology)?
d) Who has to fulfill the obligation?
The Turkish Government has committed to establishing 
partial objectives for national agencies. Specifically, heating 
and cooling targets shall be under the auspices of General 
Directorate of Renewable Energy.

There are several downsides to non-fulfillment of these 
targets (or perhaps a more realistic way to phrase this in 
Turkey’s case would be not acting in a way to promote the 
already developing use of renewables in heating and cooling), among which the most critical are:
1. Negative impact in the Turkish Current Account Balance: Low utilization of renewable energy for heating and 
cooling would call for increased use of fossil fuels and 
thus, imported energy sources, which in return cause an 
increase in the deficit in the current account balance. 
2. Negative impact in terms of energy dependency: 
Similar to the above item, there is the risk of exposure to 
the fossil fuel supply and fossil fuel price volatility.
3. Negative impact in economic terms: Less contribution 
to economic development due to less activity in developing these facilities and installing solutions/equipment.
4. Opportunity cost: Available renewable energy resources in Turkey including solar irradiation, geothermal 
capacity and biomass would be wasted.
5. Environmental risks: Low utilization of renewable 
energy for heating and cooling would call for increased use of fossil fuels, which have an adverse impact 
on the environment, in terms of waste, emissions, etc.
f) Is there any mechanism to supervise fulfillment?
See 4.3.f for details.
g) Is there any mechanism to modify obligations/targets?
See 4.3.g for details.
Financial support
a) What is the name and a short description of the 
plan?
“Projects such as “Efficiency Improvement Projects” 
and “Voluntary Agreements” will also apply to and support 
the use of energy from renewable sources in heating and 
cooling in Turkey. This topic was arranged in the Regulation 
Regarding Increasing Efficiency in the Use of Energy Resources and Energy Consumption (Published in Official Gazette 
No. 28097 on 27.10.211). Apart from aforementioned plan, 
an additional plan for this specific field does not exist.
“Facilities which use electricity generation systems from 
renewable energy or cogeneration/micro-cogeneration 
system that have a cycle efficiency of at least eighty 
percent and above which supply the energy need of the 
idil bid ild ihih
According to this: Within two years of the signing of the 
Efficiency Improvement contract and after the industrial 
business informs General Directorate of Renewable Energy, the General Directorate or an authorized legal delegate 
will evaluate the industrial business within the scope of the 
communique’s procedures and principles within sixty days 
of the notification date. Within the scope of the aforementioned statement, the suitability of the project is controlled. Necessary measurement defined within the scope of 
the communique published by the General Directorate 
of Renewable Energy will be utilized to measure if the 
expected saving were obtained or not. Performance report 
which contains information about the performance, certified public accountant approved bills, measurements and 
calculations of the industrial business should be prepared 
and presented to General Directorate of Renewable Energy. If the required conditions for the site evaluation are not 
met, then the business cannot be supported.
Additionally, within the scope of the same regulation two 
incentives are available regarding “Voluntary Agreements”;
Legal entities that make voluntary agreements with the 
General Directorate of Renewable Energy and fulfill their 
commitment regarding the industrial business agreement, General Directorate of Renewable Energy will meet 
the 20% of the energy expenses if the Directorate has 
enough grants and will pay up to two hundred thousand 
Turkish Liras. The arithmetic average of the difference 
between each year compared to the reference energy 
intensity year is taken as the principle value in order to 
calculate the reduction ratio. At the same time, if the 
energy intensity reduction committed is less than the 
committed value in the end year of the agreement, it has 
to be less than the reference energy intensity.
In the case of the following activities are to be performed 
by the industrial business within the agreement period, the 
annual total energy consumption will be deducted as well 
as energy intensity calculation just for one year; converting 
waste to heat and electricity through modern combustible systems, locally manufactured cogeneration systems 
that have a cycle efficiency greater than eighty percent or 
generation of electricity through hydro, wind, geothermal, 
solar and biomass resources. Cogeneration facilities that 
can prove that more than seventy percent of the cost is 
fulfilled by local manufacturing through certified public 
accountant are considered to be locally manufactured. The 
payment plan for the end of the voluntary agreement period is decided by the General Directorate depending on its 
allowances. The priority is offered for the support payments 
of previous years, and for the current year the payment 
is processed as the ratio of the allowance to the support 
Thfhill bddfihb) What are the measures taken to ensure availability of necessary budget/funding to achieve the 
national target?
There has not been any measure defined within this scope.
c) Does support differ according to technology?
The “Projects for Increasing Energy Efficiency” and 
“Volunteer Contracts” do not distinguish according to 
technology.
d) What is the expected impact in terms of energy 
production?
The proposed financial plans would aim to promote new 
eligible heat generation projects from renewable energy in 
order to help Turkey meet its target, which is a 20% reduction 
of energy intensity by 2023 compared to the values for 2011.
e) Is support conditional on meeting energy efficiency criteria?
The supports are structured according to energy 
efficiency criteria. 
f) Is it an existing measure? Could you please indicate 
national legislation regulating it?
The mentioned measures are defined in the energy 
efficiency legislation.
• Energy Efficiency Law (No. 5627 published in Official 
Gazette No.26510 on May 2, 2007)
• Regulation Regarding Increasing Efficiency in Using 
Energy Resources and Energy Usage (Published in 
Official Gazette No. 28097 on October 27, 2011)
• Small and Medium Size Enterprises Development 
and Support Administration (KOSGEB) Support Regulation (Published in Official Gazette No. 27612 on 
June 15, 2010).
g) Are there maximum or minimum sizes of system 
which are eligible?
There are no limitations for the system sizes.
4.5 Plans to support and promote the use of energy from renewable resources in transport applied 
by Turkey 
Questions below are answered based on current and future 
plans already agreed by the Turkish Government. Nevertheless, the future NEEAP is also concerned with other end 
use energy efficiency measures including in industry and 
transport. Thus, this chapter is subjected to future updates in 
dih hd ihNEEAP
a) What are the concrete obligations/targets per year 
(per fuel or technology)?
In order to fulfill European directives, at least 10% renewable energy is to be used in the transportation sector. 
The Turkish Government has established a set of obligations for biofuel use per year. The objectives have been 
defined for the different biofuels: biodiesel and bioethanol, 
as described in section 4.2.
In the case of biodiesel fuel, the Energy Market Regulatory 
Authority Board Decision states the obligation for biodiesel fuel (No. 28607) published in the Official Gazette on 
the September 27, 2011. Biodiesel content (produced from 
domestic agricultural products) for road fuel supplied to 
the market has been mandated to be at least 1% as of the 
January 1, 2014, 2% as of the January 1, 2015, and 3% as of 
the January 1, 2016, but these targets have been cancelled 
after a communiqué published by EPDK in the Official 
Gazette (No.28688) on June 25, 2013. 
For bioethanol fuel, the obligation was published by 
the same organization on the September 27, 2011 in the 
Official Gazette (No. 28607). Bioethanol content (produced 
from domestic agricultural products) for road fuel (petroleum) supplied to the market has been mandated to be at 
least 2% as of the January 1, 2013, and 3% as of the January 
1, 2014, and these obligations are still valid despite the 
deferral for biodiesel.
b) Is there differentiation of the support according 
to fuel types or technologies? Is there any specific 
support to biofuels which meet the criteria of Article 
21(2) of the Directive?
In Turkey, in regards to biofuels, there is no differentiation in the support in reference to the tax exemption plans 
established. Both types of biofuels, biodiesel and bioethanol, are subjected to the same tax exemption plan. 2% of 
biodiesel/bioethanol produced from domestic raw material, that is blended with diesel fuel/petrol is exempt from 
the special consumption tax (ÖTV, in the Turkish acronym).
This measure responds to Strategical Purpose (SP) 5 and 
Strategical Target (ST) 2, SP-05/ST-02, of the Energy Efficiency Strategy Paper 2012 – 2023. One of the actions presented in the document proposes a tax reduction to promote 
the use of biofuels obtained from biomass sources or 
synthetic fuels in transportation.Legislation
a) What is the legal basis for this target?
The obligation was referred in the legislation published by 
the Energy Market Regulatory Authority in the Official Gazette 
the September 27, 2011 and numbered 28067 on “Amendment on Technical Regulation Communiqué on Diesel Types.
b) Are there any technology-specific targets?
The targets apply to fuels for road transportation. There 
are currently no specific targets for other carriers. The Directive 
2009/28/EC sets a 10% share of renewable energy specifically 
in the transportation sector. According to the biofuel obligations presented above, the specific targets set by Turkey are:
Biodiesel content that is produced from domestic agricultural 
products the targets set below were deferred in light of concerns regarding sustainability that were put forth in June 2013: 
• 1% as of the January 1, 2014
• 2% as of the January 1, 2015
• 3% as of the January 1, 2016.
Bioethanol content that is produced from domestic agricultural products:
• 2% as of the January 1, 2013
• 3% as of the January 1, 2014.
c) What are the concrete obligations/targets per year 
(per technology)?

17d) Who has to fulfill the obligation?
Biofuel obligations, similar to other obligations in the 
domain of energy efficiency and renewable energy, are a 
commitment of the Government of Turkey.
In order to fulfill the target, partial objectives are established for retail petrol companies in charge of supplying 
fuel(s) to the market.
e) What is the consequence of non-fulfillment?
Failing to fulfill the targets in biofuels, or in general, failing 
to take action to promote biofuels is expected to cause some 
problems, among which the most important ones are:
1. Negative impact on the Turkish Current Account 
Balance: More use of biofuels would in turn lessen the 
volume and thus, cost of energy input, which is basically supplied by imported fossil fuels.
2. Negative impact in terms of energy dependency: Risk 
exposure to fossil fuel supply and fossil fuel price volatility.
3. Negative impact in economic terms: Less contribution 
in economic development due to less activity in developing these facilities and installing solutions/equipment.
4. Wasting the high level of availability of renewable 
energy resources in Turkey, including solar irradiation, 
geothermal capacity and biomass.
5. More pollution.
f) Is there any mechanism to supervise fulfillment?
See 4.3.f for details.
g) Is there any mechanism to modify obligations/
targets?
See 4.3.g for details.
Financial support
At the moment, financial support to promote the use of 
energy from renewable resources in transportation is mainly 
supported through a tax exemption plan. It has already 
been introduced, so that hereinafter the answers to the 
questions of this section will be given in light of this plan.
a) What is the name and a short description of the plan?
As mentioned before, the amendment of the obligation 
was published by the Energy Market Regulatory Authority in the 
Official Gazette (No. 28607) on the September 27, 2011. 
b) Is it a voluntary or obligatory plan?
It is a mandatory plan that retail petrol companies have 
ildbiflihfil ddih
c) Who manages the plan? (Implementing body, monitoring authority)
The targets were established by the Energy Market 
Regulatory Authority.
d) What are the measures taken to ensure availability of necessary budget/funding to achieve the 
national target?
The tax exemption plan will achieve the targets 
without budget/funding needs, since it is basically a 
reduction of tax revenue.
e) How is long-term security and reliability addressed 
by the plan?
The current plan should be extended since it only covers the short and medium term. New targets/obligations 
should be set from 2016 and 2014 onward for biodiesel and 
bioethanol, respectively.
f) Does support differ according to technology?
In the case of biodiesel, the Energy Market Regulatory 
Authority decision (No. 28067) published the obligation for 
biodiesel in the Official Gazette on the September 27, 2011. 
Biodiesel content that is produced from domestic agricultural products for road fuel supplied to the market has been 
mandated to be at least 1% as of the January 1, 2014, 2% as 
of the January 1, 2015, and 3% as of the January 1, 2016. This 
obligation (Official Gazette 28688) is deferred with another 
regulation published in June 2013.
For bioethanol, the obligation was published (Official 
Gazette 28067) by the same organization on the September 
27, 2011. Bioethanol content that is produced from domestic 
agricultural products for road fuel (petroleum) supplied to 
the market has been mandated to be at least 2% as of the 
January 1, 2013, and 3% as of the January 1, 2014.
However, both biofuels are subjected to the same tax 
exemption plan. 2% of biodiesel/bioethanol produced 
from domestic raw material, that is blended with diesel 
fuel/petrol is exempt from the special consumption tax 
(ÖTV, in the Turkish acronym).
g) What are the expected impacts in terms of energy 
production?
The expected impact is the reduction in the consumption of diesel and gasoline in Turkey due to their 
substitution by biodiesel and bioethanol (this substitution will mitigate the dependency on petrol). The level of 
substitution will depend on the mandatory yearly target.
h) Is support conditional on meeting energy efficiency criteria?
Ahhidiili) Is it an existing measure? Could you please indicate 
national legislation regulating it?
The measure already exists. Rather than a regulation, the 
issue is handled through EPDK Board decisions.
The obligation was added as a clause to the first paragraph 
of the second article of the “Technical Regulation Communiqué on Diesel Types (Liquid Fuel serial no: 15)” published in the Official Gazette dated the August 7, 2009 and 
numbered 27312. This amendment was published by the 
Energy Market Regulatory Authority in the Official Gazette 
on the September 27, 2011 and numbered 28067.
j) Are there maximum or minimum sizes of systems 
which are eligible?
For the mandatory use of biofuel, there are two yearly 
minimum mandatory usage rates, one for biodiesel and 
the other for bioethanol.
In reference to the tax exemption, there is no maximum or 
minimum system size for eligibility. The total amount of fuel 
subjected to tax exemption has not been regulated. 21
k) Is it possible for the same project to be supported 
by more than one support measure? Which measures 
can be cumulated?
Support mechanisms are not mutually exclusive.
l) Are there regional/local schemes? If so, please detail 
using the same criteria.
The plan is applicable at national level only.

into account other biomass users (agriculture and 
forest-based sectors)
Mobilization of new biomass sources
a) Please specify how much land is degraded
The total growing stock is quoted as 1.37 billion m³. 
Forests have experienced consistent growth since the 
1970s. However, the contribution of degraded forest has 
remained constant at around 82.2 million m3
 (6% of the 
total figure). The total forest area amounted to 21,389,783 
ha in 2009. Half of the forest area is either degraded or 
severely degraded, which is mainly a result of severe 
forest fires. For example, during the last decade between 
2,800 ha (in 2005) and 29,700 ha (in 2008) of forest has 
been destroyed by fire.
Degraded and abandoned forests may be used for lignocellulosic energy crop production. Energy crop plantings 
on degraded areas usually can only achieve lower yields 
compared to their potential when growth is on fertile farmland. Especially in the first 3 to 5 years, when plantings are 
established, yields are between 5 and 7 tonnes dry biomass 
per hectare. When plantings are mature and well managed, 
ildi1015 /h
According to recent studies (16), by 2020 one million 
hectares of degraded forest in Turkey can be used for lignocellulosic energy crop plantings and can achieve yields 
of 5 tonnes/ha. This would provide an additional 2 Mtoe 
of bioenergy from the agricultural sector. Furthermore, 
biomass energy can also serve as a mechanism to finance 
the rehabilitation of degraded lands.
b) Please specify how much unused arable land there is.
The total utilized agricultural area of Turkey in 2009 was 
about 38.9 million ha, where 24.3 million ha was used as 
arable land or land containing permanent crops. In general, agriculture is on a very small scale in Turkey. The largest 
agricultural player is state-owned TİGEM. In total TİGEM has 
370,000 ha of land, out of which 200,000 (54.05%) is arable 
land and the rest marginal grassland, 170,000 (45.95%).
c) Are any measures planned to encourage unused 
arable land, degraded land, etc. to be used for energy 
purposes?
As it has already been stated, 34% of the agricultural 
land in Turkey is currently not used and by 2020, one million ha of degraded forests will be available for lignocellulosic energy crop plantings with yields of 5 tonnes/ha. This

3. Sewage sludgeToday, forest management activities are predominantly focused on forest rehabilitation, afforestation and erosion control. 
Some 28% of forests have been replanted during the past decades; 2 million ha afforested and 1.5 million ha rehabilitated. 
Additionally, 620,000 ha of energy wood plantings have been 
established on forest land since 1978.
It is well known that biomass energy can also serve as 
a mechanism to finance the rehabilitation of degraded 
lands. In spite of this, there are no measures planned to encourage unused arable land and degraded land to be used 
for energy purposes. However, neither is there any legal 
restriction for converting arable land to grow lignocellulosic energy feedstock, such as short rotation forestry.
d) Is energy use of certain already available primary material (such as animal manure) planned for energy?
Experience and use of biomass for heat and electricity in 
rural areas is limited to traditional uses at the household level 
(direct burning of firewood, crop residues and dried manure). 
Large scale introduction of modern bioenergy technologies 
will entail structural changes in Turkey’s agricultural sector.
Regarding animal manure, a low use factor of 20% of cattle 
manure has been assumed to be exploitable for biogas production, suggesting an annual bioenergy potential of 0.58 
Mtoe. The poultry industry’s waste is even more concentrated, this property facilitates the use of manure for biogas 
production. The total potential is estimated at 0.3 Mtoe 
making the total potential from livestock manure 0.9 Mtoe.
Currently, there are some projects still not released publically and two projects that have been announced for producing energy (biogas) from manure are in the pipeline. The 
Efeler Dairy farm, one of the largest dairy breeding farms in 
Turkey has 2,600 head of dairy cattle. There are plans to use 
the biogas output from the farm for heating, hot water production and treatment of liquid fertilizers. The Sütaş group 
has a daily milk processing capacity of 1,200 tonnes in the 
Karacabey factory and 1,300 tonnes in the Aksaray facility. 
The company is invested in biogas production and the 2.2 
MW scale biogas facility was commissioned in 2013.
e) Is there any specific policy promoting the production and use of biogas? What type of uses are promoted (local, district heating, biogas grid, natural gas 
grid integration)?
In the case of biogas from waste, waste law implements EU directives and regular waste deposits are in 
line with EU law. It aims to reduce the amount of biodegradables by 30% in 50 years. Biogas from waste is often 
used in small captive industrial process, and therefore, 
does not benefit from FIT. In the Turkish case, the seven 
il lid lliiblfFIThih 
In terms of landfill gas, its use is restricted within the limits 
of available technology. It seems that it is unlikely that 
modern, stricter requirements and standards for the operation of landfills will be implemented in the near future, 
which should encourage investments in this technology, 
however this fact has not led to a significant increase in 
the use of landfill gas so far.
Regarding biogas from livestock manure, its rapid development was mainly driven by favorable feed-in tariffs for electricity. Farmers of smaller scale biogas plants mainly earn 
money (13.3 USD cent/kWh) with the production of electricity. Therefore, feed-in tariff plans can be seen as a policy for 
the promotion of the production and use of biogas.
f) What measures are planned to improve forest management techniques in order to maximize the extraction of biomass from the forest in a sustainable way? 
How will forest management be improved in order to 
increase future growth? What measures are planned 
to maximize the extraction of existing biomass that 
can already be put into practice?
The General Directorate of Forestry (GDF) is currently 
promoting the use of forest residues for energy purposes. 
Currently forest residues are mostly disposed of by stacking 
and burning in order to reduce forest maintenance costs, 
however, there is still room for improvement in that regard.
Turkey is mountainous and forestry infrastructure is in poor 
condition, as a result transportation costs climb easily. This is 
one of the main issues that should be addressed in order to 
maximize the extraction of biomass from forests and increase 
future growth. The overall demand for forest roads was estimated at about 210,000 km in 2009, of which an approximate 
two-thirds (2/3) have been constructed. Regulations on the 
transportation of forest products in Turkey and the criteria 
used in the calculation of costs are regulated in Governmental Decree No: 288 (published on the January 5, 1996).
To ensure that biomass extraction from forests is performed in a sustainable way, all forestry measures (thinning, 
cuttings) have to be carried out in compliance with 
the forest management plans prepared by the General 
Directorate of Forestry (GDF). These plans are prepared 
according to Forest Management Regulation, which 
has been regulated since the February 5, 2007. Forestry, 
including pruning and thinning of forests, is regulated in 
Government Decree No. 298 “Silvicultural Fundamentals 
and Principles to be Applied in our Forests” published on 
the November 1, 2006.
The easiest way to prove sustainability is the use of verified 
woodland. There are currently two Forest Management 
Cifii94662 hd 103 ChifCdby the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). Other certification 
plans, such as the Program for the Endorsement of Forest 
Certification (PEFC), are not yet operational.
Apart from the feed-in tariffs (FIT) plan, there exists a set 
of incentives within the Renewable Energy Law No: 5346 
framework. Among them, the most closely related to forestry is the one that allows the use of national parks and 
protected areas through the necessary permits.
Impact on other sectors
a) How will the impact of energy use of biomass on 
other sectors based on agriculture and forestry be 
monitored? What is the impact? (If possible, please 
provide information also on quantitative effects.) Is 
the monitoring of the impact planned in the future?
There is growing concern about competing land use: 
food, livestock and conversion from agriculture to other 
uses, such as for energy crops. The population is worried 
about the risk of trading food against fuel.
Future domestic food and feed area requirements are the 
result of developments in food demand (population and 
dietary changes) combined with changes in production 
intensity (crop yields and intensity in livestock production) 
and trade in agricultural products. As a result, food demand 
in Turkey is expected to expand in the coming decades.
With respect to forestry, this industry could find a market 
for biomass that was previously left as residue and sawmills 
could achieve higher incomes from sawdust, bark, etc. For 
instance, most pruning residues are either left on ground 
after they have been shredded or destroyed in the case of 
parasite problems. The economics of pruning collection 
and environmental considerations suggest that about 25% 
are potentially usable for modern bioenergy production 
resulting in 0.2 Mtoe/a22 bioenergy potential.
At the same time, an increase in demand on the part of 
bioenergy could lead to competition over pulpwood and 
thereby, contribute to increased prices even on biomass 
that would be used for industrial purposes (e.g. raw materials for the forestry industry).
b) What kind of development is expected in other 
sectors based on agriculture and forestry that could 
have an impact on the energy use? (e.g. could improve efficiency/productivity increase or decrease the 
amount of by-products available for energy use?)
First, by-products and residue not currently used by 
industry could lead to additional income for companies 
within both the agriculture and forestry industries. 
Productivity increase would also increase the amount of 
residue, impacting the raw material used for energy purposes. However, efficiency improvements in the utilization 
of raw materials could lead to lower by-product levels. For 
example, sawmills with better machinery, thinner blades 
or optimized cut layout, result in lower residue: sawdust, 
wood chips and waste wood. The optimization of processes often leads to a decreased consumption of raw materials for the main product and therefore, to the reduction 
of by-products.
4.7 Planned use of statistical transfers between 
Turkey and Member States and planned participation in joint projects with other countries
There is no planned use of statistical transfers between Turkey and Member States nor planned participation in joint 
projects with other countries, however these participations 
and collaborations may be in the agenda for near future.
For the moment, Turkey does not expect to use any 
renewable energy from abroad to meet the objectives established. Therefore, no negotiations with other Member 
States or other countries have started as of today. Nevertheless, Turkey is interested in ensuring flexible cooperation mechanisms among countries, which might lead to 
further development of renewable energies. As a result, 
the participation of working groups on flexible cooperation mechanisms should be promoted.
Regarding national procedures to be established for arranging a statistical transfer or joint project, Turkey will publish 
guidelines on the use of flexible mechanisms for cooperation. These guidelines will comply with the European 
Directive and be in line with the mechanism and processes 
agreed in the working groups.5
ASSESSMENTS5.1 Total expected contribution by each renewable energy technology to meet the binding 2023 
targets and the indicative interim trajectory of 
energy shares from renewable resources in electricity, heating & cooling and transportation
The figures in Tables 22a 22b are the Turkish forecast. They 
are based on model calculations with 2012 as their base year, 
the calculations were performed for the years 2013 to 2023.
The model estimates the installed capacity for different technologies and is based on the 2023 targets for the Turkish 
energy system. Installed capacity targets are:
• 34,000 MW of hydropower
• At least 60023 MW of geothermal power.
• At least 5,000 MW of solar power.
• 20,000 MW of wind power (this power capacity has all 
been sized for onshore technology).
• 1,000 MW of biomass power.
In total, by 2023, around 60 GW of renewable energy will 
be installed.
The evolution of the installed capacity from the base year 
to 2023 is based on the following assumptions:
• Hydropower: the growing trend based on recent data 
of this technology and its future forecast.
• Geothermal power: assessed, according to the trends 
in the evolution of electricity demand and the need to 
meet its established target.
• Solar power: for solar PV according to the evolution of 
electricity demand and the need to meet the established target.
• Wind power: an incremental increase to 1,000 MW 
for 2014. From 2014 onward the growing trend is to 
be estimated according to the evolution of electricity 
demand and the need to meet the established target.
• Biomass power: according to the evolution of electricity 
demand and the need to meet the established target.
Given the targets presented above, the gross electricity 
generation in 2023 would be 91,800 GWh for hydropower; 
50,000 GWh for onshore wind energy; 5,100 GWh for 
geothermal energy; 8,000 GWh for solar energy; and 4,533 
GWh for biomass. All in all, the total gross electricity generation would be 159,433 GWh. This quantity represents 
37% of the total forecast consumption in 2023; the commitment of the Government is 30%, 127,324 GWh.
In reference to heating and cooling, the capacity would 
have an increase of 18% with reference to base year. 
The Turkish Government has a strong commitment to renewable sources in the transportation sector. Obligations 
and support plans have been established in order to meet 
the targets. The policies for biodiesel and bioethanol can 
be seen below:
• Biodiesel: two measures have been adopted to promote its usage, tax exemption and mandatory usage of 
this fuel (this has been repealed).
Tax exemption: 2% of biodiesel produced from domestic raw material, that is blended with diesel fuel is 
exempt from the special consumption tax (ÖTV, in the 
Turkish acronym). 
Obligation: According to the Energy Market Regulatory 
Authority Decision published in the Official Gazette (No. 
28607) on the September 27, 2011, biodiesel content 
that is produced from domestic agricultural products 
for road fuel supplied to the market has been mandated 
to be at least 1% as of the January 1, 2014, 2% as of the 
January 1, 2015, and 3% as of the January 1, 2016.
• Bioethanol: as in the case of biodiesel, the same type 
of measures have been adopted.
Tax exemption: 2% of bioethanol produced from 
domestic raw material, that is blended with petrol is 
exempt from the special consumption tax. 
Obligation: According to the Energy Market Regulatory 
Authority Decision published in the Official Gazette 
(No. 28607) on the September 27, 2011, bioethanol 
content that is produced from domestic agricultural 
products for road fuel (petroleum) supplied to the 
market has been mandated to be at least 2% as of the 
January 1, 2013, and 3% as of the January 1, 2014.
Thanks to these policies and the consumption of electricity in transport based on renewable sources, the total 
amount of energy coming from renewable sources has 
bid 1800 ki202324

175.2 Total contribution expected from energy efficiency and energy saving measures to meet the binding 
2023 targets and the indicative interim trajectory for 
the shares of energy from renewable sources
The estimated targets are subject to the fulfillment of 
energy efficiency measures set by Directive 2012/27/EU of 
the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 
2012 on Energy Efficiency (18), and Directive 2009/125/EC 
of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 establishing a framework for ecodesign requirements for energy-related products. Moreover, measures 
designed by the Turkish Government, existing and new 
mechanisms to be included in the future NEEAP, will also 
play an important role in the fulfillment of these targets.
5.3 Assessments of the impact
Large scale penetration of renewable energies will have 
a very positive impact on Turkey due to the following 
externalities:
• Energy dependence reduction from other countries 
and security of supply. According to political objectives, electricity consumption is expected to be 30 
percent from renewables by 2023. Considering the 
latest developments in Turkey, by 2023 due to energy 
generation from renewables, 21 billion m3
 of natural 
gas importation will be avoided along with 47 million 
tons of C02
 emissions.
• Positive contribution in economic terms: Substantial 
impact on GDP due to the development of renewable 
energy facilities, and the supplying of equipment, components and services.
• Human resources development: qualified employment.
• Development of R&D activities.
These externalities are detailed hereafter.
Energy dependence reduction from other countries
The development of renewable energy facilities in the 
electricity sector based on autochthonous sources will 
avoid the installation of fossil fuel fired units based on 
imported energy inputs as well as contributing to the 
security of supply.
The forecast of this impact is based on the following 
assumptions:
• Renewable energy would substitute the installation of 
more combined cycle gas turbine units, currently the 
most advanced and common fossil fuel technology.
• The performance ratio of natural gas combined cycle 
gas turbine would be 55%.
• All natural gas that is substituted by renewable energy 
would be imported.
• According to political objectives, in 2023 30% of electricity will be generated from renewable resources: RES 
would generate 127 TWh (30% of 424 TWh) in 2030.
Penetration of renewable energy as targeted will help to 
avoid the importation of more than 19 million toe of natural gas per year. According to the natural gas price forecast 
published by the US Department of Energy Organization 
(around USD2010 5/Btu), the forecast total saving due to the 
avoided energy imports would USD 4,000 million.

The development of renewable energy facilities for 
electricity generation will mitigate CO2 emissions in the 
atmosphere.
The estimate of this impact is based on the following 
assumptions:
• Renewable energies would substitute combined 
cycle gas turbine units, currently the most advanced 
and common fossil fuel technology.
• The emission factor per MWh generated by combined 
cycle gas turbine technology is 0.37 tons.
According to political objectives, in 2023 30% of electricity 
will be generated from renewable resources: RES would 
generate 127 TWh (30% of 424 TWh) in 2030.
Adoption of renewable energy as targeted will help to 
avoid more than 47 million tons of CO2
 emissions: considering a price of € 20 per CO2
 emission EU allowance26, 
the economic impact of CO2
 emission mitigation would 
amount to USD 1,262 million.
Positive contribution in economic terms: impact on GDP
Based on the large scale penetration of new renewable energy infrastructure, new industrial activities will be developed.
The figures detailed below represent a sampling of the 
possible impact on the GDP:
• Impact in the construction phase of wind energy 
infrastructure:
- Installed capacity in 2013: 2,759 MW
- 2023 target: 20,000 MW
- Investment per MW (hypothesis): USD2013 1.179 milliard
- Investment by Turkish residents (hypothesis): 30%.
Forecasted impact on the Turkish GDP during the 
investment phase (2013-2023): USD2013 6.274 milliard.
• Impact in the operational phase (annual economic impact).
- Annual contribution per MWh: USD2013 86,401
- 2023 target: 20,000 MW.
Forecast annual impact on the Turkish GDP (2023): approximately USD2013 1.728 billion.
