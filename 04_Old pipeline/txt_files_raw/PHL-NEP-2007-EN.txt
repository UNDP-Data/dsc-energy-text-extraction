PHILIPPINE ENERGY PLAN
2007-2014ABOUT THE COVER 
The cover design depicts the crucial role of energy in fuelling global 
development efforts and the necessary engine essential for sustained 
economic growth. It is in this light that the Department of Energy remains 
firm and resolute to aggressively pursue the energy agenda focused on 
enhancing the country’s access to energy. This is instrumental in reducing 
poverty as well as promoting social equity. 
The development of indigenous energy resources is critical in 
achieving greater energy supply security for the country. Likewise, the 
implementation of relevant energy reforms will encourage more investors 
to engage in energy projects in a business-friendly environment. The 
trickle-down effect is a wider range of economic opportunities in the 
countryside. 
This Plan Update outlines the strategies to ensure that energy 
requirements of future generations are provided adequately and in Fuelling Philippine Development through

Energy is indispensable to our economic growth and to the country’s 
drive towards global competitiveness. It is crucial to sustaining a nation’s 
progress and prosperity and an instrument for poverty reduction and social 
equity. In recent times, the energy sector has been confronted with several 
challenges, which continue to be multi-dimensional. The specter of high 
energy prices brought about by depleting resources, mostly fossil fuelbased, is causing economies, both large-scale and fast developing ones, 
to scamper and compete for their equal share in the world energy resource 
pie to fund their own development agenda. An equally compelling concern 
which has reached universal proportions is to look for cleaner energy 
alternatives to mitigate the long-term effects of energy development to global 
warming. A country’s economic progress has thus become intertwined with 
the level of its energy security and environmental sustainability. 
In this context, the 2007 Philippine Energy Plan Update has been 
formulated to serve as a potent tool in carrying out the national economic 
plan of the government. The energy choices as indicated in the Plan are 
also biased to the overall thrust of the government to ensure an integrated 
energy-environment approach.
With the 2005-2014 PEP as its reference plan as well as the actual accomplishments of the sector from 
2006 to 2007 as bases, the 2007 PEP Update builds on existing plans and programs and incorporates new 
directives to reflect emerging developments. It remains focused on attaining a 60.0 percent self-sufficiency level 
by 2010 in the pursuit of energy independence and ensuring reasonably-priced electricity through the effective 
implementation of power sector reforms. Recent developments have been cited, to include: the passage of the 
“Biofuels Act” in January 2007 to provide the impetus to the country’s Alternative Fuels Program; the surge in the 
privatization level of the generation assets of National Power Corporation (NPC) from 11.0 percent in 2006 to 
42.7 as of end-2007; and the 96.6 percent barangay electrification status resulting from a strong collaborative 
public-private partnership. 
The Plan provides specific directions for the accelerated exploration and development of indigenous energy 
resources to reduce our vulnerability to high oil prices, intensified use of renewable energy resources and 
alternative fuels for a cleaner environment, enhanced promotion of energy efficiency and conservation as a 
way of life, implementation of rural electrification projects to light up remote and far-flung communities in the 
countryside and continuous accomplishment of reforms in the power sector. A major addition to the Plan Update 
is the consideration of the viability of nuclear power as a long-term policy for clean energy option. In the 
immediate term, the emphasis will be on building the requisite human resource capability and preparing the 
substantive framework and technical aspects of a nuclear power program. 
The Department of Energy is confident that the goal to a brighter and cleaner energy future has been laid 
down in this Plan Update but all these initiatives will come to naught without the support and cooperation of 
everyone who has a stake on energy- the economic sectors composed of the consumers, transport, industrial, 
commercial and agriculture; national government agencies, non-government organizations, and civil society, 
among others. 
The government alone cannot single-handedly implement the imperatives of this Plan as these would require 
multi-sectoral commitment and engagement. We thus, enjoin and encourage every concerned and responsible 
Filipino to put his stake in this Plan and make this a reality.

I. Overview
The 2007 Philippine Energy 
Plan (PEP) Update is an affirmation of 
the state’s commitment to pursue the 
energy independence agenda under 
the Government’s Five-Point Reform 
Package. The energy sector’s agenda 
focuses on attaining a sustainable 
60.0 percent energy self-sufficiency 
beyond 2010 and promoting a 
globally competitive energy sector. 
The first objective is anchored on 
the effective implementation of the 
following goals: (a) accelerating 
the exploration; development and 
utilization of indigenous energy 
resources; (b) intensifying renewable 
energy resource development; (c) 
increasing the use of alternative 
fuels; and, (d) enhancing energy 
efficiency and conservation. On the 
other hand, the continuing reforms 
in the power sector as well as the 
downstream oil and gas industries 
will pave the way in realizing a 
globally competitive Philippine 
energy sector.
Those energy goals and the 
corresponding strategies support 
the Medium-Term Philippine 
Development Plan (2005-2010) and 
the Medium-Term Public Investment 
Program. The PEP is also consistent 
with international agreements such 
as the 2002 Johannesburg Summit 
and the 2000 UN Millennium 
Development Goals, specifically in 
addressing poverty, and ensuring 
environmental sustainability.

in 2006 vis-à-vis the targets set in 
the 2006 PEP Update as Reference 
Plan. It also evaluates the extent to 
which the sector has responded to 
the challenges that have hindered 
the effective implementation of the 
plans and programs as identified 
in the Reference Plan. On the 
bases of these actual assessments, 
adjustments in targets and desired 
timelines were made in the Plan 
Framework. Indigenous fossil 
fuels and renewable energy were 
discussed based on geographical 
clustering under the Super Regions 
to highlight each cluster-region’s 
energy resources potentials. 
Likewise, the current update takes 
into consideration the impact of 
recent energy developments, i.e., 
the landmark passage in January 
development sector through the 
Philippine Energy Contracting 
Round (PECR), commitments to 
regional frameworks such as the 
ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy 
Cooperation (2004-2009) and the 
ASEAN initiative to move forward 
the harmonization of biofuel 
standards. 
Over the planning horizon, the 
Update’s overall energy and power 
demand forecasts of annual growth 
rates are 3.3 percent and 5.2 
percent, respectively. Essentially, 
it will also be guided by the same 
policy directions, planning horizon, 
sets of assumptions and sectoral 
plans and programs with due 
consideration to gender sensitive 
approaches. Some modifications, transmission projects has also been updated consistent 
with the rulings of the Energy Regulatory Commission 
(ERC).
 
The highlights of the sector’s performance are as 
follows: 
� The country posted an energy self-sufficiency 
level of 55.4 percent in 2006. Among renewable 
energy resources, geothermal contributed the 
biggest share of indigenous energy of about 9.0 
million tones of oil equivalent (MTOE) or 23.2 
percent of the total primary energy mix, which is 
a slight improvement over its 2005 share of 21.6 
percent. This is due to an increase of 5.7 percent in 
geothermal production. The share of imported fuels 
such as oil gradually declined in view of reduced 
consumption of oil in both power and non-power 
applications. 
� Towards attaining the 60.0 percent primary energy 
self-sufficiency level by 2010, the Department 
of Energy (DOE) continued to promote intensive 
upstream exploration and development through 
the PECR. As of end-2006, there were 28 oil and 
gas service contracts (SCs) currently operating. 
Twenty-two of these SCs were granted during the 
period of 2004-2006. There are also 38 existing 
Coal Operating Contracts (COCs). 
� The promulgation of the Biofuels Act of 2006 is 
expected to reduce the country’s dependence on 
imported fuels over the long-term by mandating 
the graduated use of biodiesel and bioethanol 
nationwide. Subsequently, in May 2007, the law’s 
Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) was 
approved following a series of nationwide public 
consultations. Meanwhile, investments came in 
the form of infrastructure facilities to support the 
widespread dissemination of biofuels such as the 
launching of the Biofuels Center in Quezon City in 
February 2006. 
� In power generation, the country’s self-sufficiency 
level rose to 66.0 percent in 2006 from the 65.0 
percent level in 2005. Natural gas provided 
the largest contribution of 16,366 gigawatthours (GWh) or 29.0 percent of the total power 
generation while coal accounted for 27.0 
percent. The 2.9 percent decrease on the use of 
natural gas in 2006 level was due to the 25-day 
scheduled maintenance of the Malampaya Gas-toPower project while the slight increase in power 
generation from coal-fired power plant came from 
the last months of 2006, the commissioning of the 
210-MW Mindanao coal power plant located in 
Villanueva, Misamis Oriental brought significant 
improvement in the power supply in the grid. To 
further boost this effort is the ongoing capacity 
uprating of Units 1 and 2 of Agus 6 Hydroelectric 
Power Plants. In February 2007, the Philippine 
National Oil Company-Energy Development 
Corporation (PNOC-EDC) inaugurated the 49.4-
MW Northern Negros Geothermal Power Plant 
located in Bago City, Negros Occidental, adding 
to the capacity of the Visayas Grid. 
� To counter the effects of intermittent increase 
in the price of oil to the country’s economy, the 
DOE remained vigilant in ensuring consumer 
protection and healthy competition among the 
industry players. As a safety net, the DOE issued 
and implemented for a six-month period (June to 
November 2006) Executive Order (E.O.) 527 
“Temporarily Modifying the Rates of Import Duty 
on Crude Petroleum Oils and Refined Petroleum 
products Under Section 104 of the Tariff and 
Custom Code of 1978 as Amended.” Likewise, 
various oil players offered price discounts for 
diesel sold at the pump nationwide for the public 
transport sector.
� For 2006, the energy conservation efforts of the 
government generated energy savings of about 
0.88 MTOE with equivalent carbon dioxide 
(CO2) emission avoidance of 2.1 million metric 
tons (MMMT). This included savings accounted 
from the energy management activities conducted 
by DOE such as the spot check program of 
government agencies nationwide mandated by 
Administrative Order (A.O.) 126, the continuing 
energy standards and labeling program, and the 
conduct of energy audit of various commercial and 
industrial entities. 
� The Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) 
started commercial operation in Luzon in June 
2006 signaling an important phase in promoting 
open access in accordance with the Electric Power 
Industry Reform Act (EPIRA) of 2001.
� The government’s continuing efforts to privatize the 
National Power Corporation’s (NPC) generation 
and transmission assets made significant headway 
with the successful bid-out of the 112-MW 
Pantabangan-Masiway Hydroelectric Plant in 
Nueva Ecija in September 2006, the 360-MW 
Magat Hydroelectric Plant in Ramon Isabela in 
Oveto be energized to achieve 100 percent barangay 
electrification target as committed in the ten-point 
legacy agenda of the Arroyo Administration. 
� To provide timely, reliable and accurate energy 
data and information for the Department and its 
stakeholders, the Energy Information Management 
Program (EIMP) had been implemented under 
the theme “One Database, One System, One 
DOE.” The EIMP entails four Cs strategy, namely: 
Centralization, Computerization, Connectivity and 
Collaboration. 
Way Forward
� Given the severe impact of climate-altering 
greenhouse gas emissions and skyrocketing crude 
oil prices, the DOE has started a reassessment of 
nuclear energy as a long-term power option for 
the country. This reassessment also considers that 
many of our Asian and ASEAN neighbors are using 
or will use nuclear power to provide them with 
cheaper and more reliable electricity, making them 
even more economically competitive. Ultimately, 
the decision to tap nuclear power will have to be 
undertaken in a rational, informed and transparent 
manner. This requires consultation not only with all 
local stakeholders but with recent international 
partners such as the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA), ASEAN and others. 
 To prepare for this eventuality, however, the 
training of nuclear scientists and experts who 
can help policy makers and authorities need to 
start immediately. Towards this end, the DOE in 
collaboration with the Department of Science and 
Technology (DOST)-Philippine Nuclear Research 
Institute (PNRI) and the University of the PhilippinesCollege of Science are preparing a long-term 
nuclear technology manpower development 
program.
� An ongoing review of the government’s privatization 
of its generation and transmission assets is aimed 
at responding to the various market needs and 
requirements with due consideration to timeliness 
and transparency. The Power Sector Assets and 
Liabilities Management Corp. (PSALM) is set to 
launch more aggressive marketing efforts with 
the goal of increasing the existing 24.8 percent 
privatization level to 50.0 percent by end-2007 
and 70.0 percent by end-20081.
file with the 14th Congress the following legislative 
measures: 
 Renewable Energy Bill to promote the 
development, utilization and commercialization 
of renewable energy resources such as 
geothermal, hydropower, wind, solar and 
ocean. Private sector participation will also be 
encouraged through the granting of additional 
fiscal and non-fiscal incentives;
 Natural Gas Bill to create favorable conditions 
for the establishment of the downstream natural 
gas industry by providing the necessary 
regulatory and non-regulatory measures, as 
well as the granting of additional fiscal and 
non-fiscal incentives that will encourage greater 
investments in the industry;
 Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Bill to provide 
monitoring and supervisory framework 
for the LPG industry, as well as address 
unfair trade practices which include underrefilling, unauthorized or illegal refilling, 
use of unbranded cylinders, use of unsafe 
and dilapidated cylinders, among others. 
Likewise, the DOE will be given additional 
powers to develop and implement a 
comprehensive program that will promote 
national consciousness on safety requirements 
and proper use of LPG including provision of 
appropriate penalties for violators; 
 Energy Conservation Bill to institutionalize 
energy conservation and enhance the 
efficient use of energy in the country. The bill 
will also revitalize and strengthen the energy 
conservation programs developed such as 
the nationwide energy monitoring program, 
product labeling, energy efficiency promotion, 
etc.; and
 TransCo Franchise Bill to grant the National 
Transmission Company (TransCo) an 
assignable franchise to construct, install, 
operate and maintain a transmission system 
and the grid nationwide for a period of 50 
years. It will also provide conveyance or 
transmission of electricity through the highvoltage backbone system of interconnected 
transmission lines, substation and related 
facilities, grid connections and ancillary 
services.

A. SITUATIONER (2006)
ENERGY-ECONOMY INDICATORS
The country’s economy kept its dynamic pace in 
2006,2 registering a 5.4 percent growth in Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP). The Services sector continued 
to boost the economy with a 6.7 percent growth while 
the Agriculture, Fishery and Forestry sectors expanded 
by 3.8 percent. On the other hand, the Industry sector 
grew by 4.6 percent due mainly to the stable output 
of the manufacturing and construction sectors with 
respective growths of 4.6 percent and 7.3 percent 
each. On the demand-side, the strong GDP growth was 
backed up primarily by strong private and government 
expenditures which grew by 5.5 percent and 6.1 percent 
respectively, while exports rose by 14.9 percent.3 
Energy Intensity 
The ratio of total primary energy supply (TPES) per 
unit of economic output or energy intensity in 2006 
was recorded at 3.04 tonnes of oil equivalent (TOE)/

Philippine Peso (PhP) 100,000, a little lower than the 
2005 level of 3.2 TOE/PhP 100,000, (Figure 2) due 
to the slowdown in energy use particularly of petroleum 
products. Evidently, oil-to-GDP intensity dropped to 
1.08 TOE/PhP 100,000. The lower oil intensity level 
was due to the noted restraint in petroleum products 
consumption, as well as the decline in the utilization of 
oil-fired power plants during the year. This was triggered 
mainly by the continued increase in the prices of oil in 
the international market. This may likewise have been 
driven by improvements in energy efficiency through 
the introduction of new technologies, more efficient 
utilization of existing technologies, or construction of 
relatively less energy-intensive industries. Meanwhile, 
electricity-to-GDP intensity likewise plummeted to 0.31 
TOE/Php 100,000.
Energy-to-GDP Elasticity
The GDP growth during the year did not translate 
to a corresponding increase in energy consumption 
as indicated by the negative 0.05 energy-to-GDP 
elasticity (Figure 3). As cited above, the economic 
growth was primarily triggered by the less energyintensive commercial or services sector. The declining 
trend in energy-to-GDP elasticity, notably from 2005, 
may be attributed to the effective energy efficiency GDP at 1.2 in 2005 and 1.1 in 2006. Meanwhile, 
electricity consumption posted a positive elasticity of 
0.2 during the period which was lower compared to 
the previous year’s level of 0.5 (Figure 3).
Per Capita Consumption
Similarly, per capita consumption of total energy, 
oil and electricity dropped to 0.45 TOE, 0.16 TOE 
and 0.05 TOE, respectively (Figure 4).
PRIMARY ENERGY SUPPLY
The country’s total primary energy supply in 
2006 reached 38.7 MTOE, lower by 0.3 percent 
from the 2005 level of 38.9 MTOE. Total indigenous 
production increased by 1.2 percent from the previous 
year’s level of 21.2 MTOE. Net imports4, on the other 
hand, slightly increased by 2.1 percent from the yearago level of 17.6 MTOE. 
Oil accounted for the biggest share of 35.5 
percent in the supply mix (Figure 5) despite the 
decrease in total oil supply from 14.5 MTOE in 2005 
to 13.8 MTOE in 2006. Share of indigenous oil 
slightly went down by 0.1 percentage points over the 
previous year’s 1.6 percent. This was attributed to 
the shut-in of Nido and Matinloc wells which are now 
in near-depletion state.
Year-to-date production of natural gas reached 
2.5 MTOE or 6.5 percent of the total energy supply 
(Figure 5). This level is lower by 0.17 MTOE from last 
year’s 2.7 MTOE caused by the 25-day scheduled 
maintenance of the Malampaya Gas-to-Power project.

percent from the year-ago level of 1.52 MTOE which 
was caused by the slow down in the production of 
Semirara brought about by a substantial decrease in 
the demand for local coal. 
Meanwhile, geothermal energy registered an 
increase of 5.7 percent from 8.52 MTOE last year. Its 
current level accounted for 23.2 percent in the overall 
primary energy mix (Figure 5). Hydro went up from 
2.09 MTOE in 2005 to 2.47 MTOE in 2006. Its share 
in the primary energy mix increased from 5.4 percent 
in 2005 to 6.4 percent in 2006 (Figure 5).

about 2.0 percent lower than the previous year’s level. 
Of the total supply of biomass, fuelwood accounted 
for 62.4 percent share, charcoal for 12.1 percent 
share and other biomass for 25.5 percent share.
 
Imported Energy
In 2006, 44.6 percent of the TPES was imported 
energy (Figure 5). This level was 0.83 percentage 
point lower than the previous year’s level. Net oil 
importation reached 13.2 MTOE, 5.3 percent lower 
from 2005 level. On the other hand, coal imports 
increased by 9.8 percent from the 3.71 MTOE level 
in 2005.Energy Supply and De
increase in the generation from coal-fired power plant 
may be attributed to the commercial operation of the 
210-MW Mindanao coal power plant of Steag in the 
last quarter of 2006.
On the other hand, geothermal energy 
contributed 18.4 percent share to the generation 
mix while hydroelectric power plants accounted for 
a 17.5 percent share (Figure 6). Generation from oilbased power plants dropped by 24.0 percent from 
6,141 GWh in 2005 to 4,665 GWh in 2006 due 
largely to restraint in oil consumption triggered by the 
continued increase of oil prices in the international 
market. Meanwhile, renewable energy sources such 
as solar and wind, contributed 0.1 percent share to 
the generation mix.
 
Fuel Input
The total amount of fuel used for power generation 
in 2006 reached 18.6 MTOE, which was 0.6 percent 
lower than the 2005 level of 18.7 MTOE.
Coal remained as the major fuel for power 
generation with total usage of 3.71 MTOE, which 
was 10.1 percent lower than the previous year’s 
level of 4.13 MTOE. The use of natural gas for 
electricity generation likewise went down by 7.3 
percent, compared with last year’s 2.5 MTOE. Power 
generation from oil (diesel and fuel oil) reached 1.04 
MTOE, 26.9 percent lower than the 2005 level of 
1.42 MTOE. 
FINAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION
Total final energy consumption (TFEC) reached 
22.5 MTOE in 2006, registering a decline of 3.0 
percent from the 2005 level of 23.2 MTOE. 
Most sectors of the economy experienced a down 
trend in terms of energy utilization. The pattern of 
energy demand for the period can be attributed to the 
continuing increase in the costs of petroleum products 
which turned consumers in more prudent ways of 
utilizing energy. 
Out of the total energy demand in 2006, the 
transport sector remained the largest energy-consuming 
sector of the economy with 37.2 percent share, 
followed by the residential sector at 28.4 percent 
(Figure 7). Energy consumption of industry sector 
represented 24.0 percent share while commercial 
and agricultural sectors accounted for 91 percent 
Out of the 10.05 MTOE crude refinery input, 
about 96.8 percent of various petroleum products 
were produced. This indicates a 0.3 percentage point 
improvement from the previous year’s production 
notwithstanding the decline in the total refinery input 
by 0.6 percent. The improvement in the production 
ratio was due to an increased output in diesel (8.4 
percent), jet fuel (5.2 percent) and LPG (1.2 percent). 
Moreover, the refinery capacity utilization 
remained at 72.9 percent,5 suggestive of refining 
efficiency. 
 
Power Generation
The country’s total power generation in 2006 
reached 56,784 GWh, slightly higher by 0.4 percent 
from last year’s level of 56,568 GWh.
Generation from natural gas-fired power plants 
dominated the power generation mix with 28.8 percent 
share (Figure 6). However, compared to its year ago 
level, power generation from natural gas-fired power 
facilities decreased by 2.9 percent due to the 25-day 
scheduled maintenance of the Malampaya Gas-to-Power 
project resulting in the interruption of natural gas supply 
to Ilijan, Sta Rita and San Lorenzo power plants.

Transport Sector
The transport sector’s overall energy consumption 
posted a 6.4 percent decrease from 8.94 MTOE in 
2005 to 8.37 MTOE in 2006. Petroleum products 
(diesel oil, gasoline and aviation fuel) constituted the 
bulk of energy consumed by the sector with electricity 
representing only about 0.1 percent of the total (see 
Figure 8). The continued increase in oil prices in the 
world market has significantly caused the decline in oil 
consumption. Meanwhile, the substantial increase in 
the consumption of autoLPG, coco-methyl ester (CME) 
and ethanol has been triggered by the government’s 
drive to promote alternative fuels for transport. The 
consumption of CME increased to 0.54 thousand 
tonnes of oil equivalent (kTOE) while ethanol used 
during the period reached 1.41 kTOE. Due to the 
significant price differential with gasoline, the use of 
LPG for transport has significantly increased, reaching 
4.03 kTOE. AutoLPG has gained popularity among 
taxi fleets and to some extent privately-owned cars.
Almost 79.3 percent of the total fuel consumption 
of the sector was used for road transport (Figure 8). 
However, this is 6.3 percent lower than the year ago 
level of 7.09 MTOE to 6.64 MTOE in 2006. 
The sector’s demand for electricity is attributable 
to the growing ridership of the Light Railway Transit 1

1.01 MTOE.
Water transport, on the other hand, accounted for 
a 8.5 percent share of the sector’s fuel consumption, 
which decreased from 0.84 MTOE in 2005 to 0.71 
MTOE in 2006.
Residential Sector
The residential sector remained as the country’s 
second major consumer of energy in 2006. Its 
utilization level reached 6.4 MTOE or 28.4 percent of 
the country’s total final energy demand. Volume-wise, 
energy usage of the sector dropped by 4.3 percent 
from last year’s 6.7 MTOE. This can be attributed 
to the sector’s lesser usage of petroleum products 
(LPG and kerosene) and traditional fuels (fuelwood, 
charcoal and other biomass) (Figure 9). Obviously, 
the demand pattern of household between 2005 
and 2006 was affected by soaring retail prices of 
oil products. Other factors such as the lesser sales of 
household appliances in 2006 and the government’s 
advocacy on energy efficiency and conservation 
may have also contributed to the level of the sector’s 
energy use.

As shown in Figure 9, there is still continued 
reliance on traditional fuels in terms of fuel requirement 
for household activities. Biomass (fuelwood, charcoal, 
agriwaste) represented 64.3 percent of the sector’s 
total demand due to its availability and abundance. 
Household consumption of biomass, however, decreased 
by 3.8 percent compared to last year’s level. Among the 
biomass fuels, fuelwood was the primary household fuel 
for cooking which gained the highest demand level at 
3.2 MTOE, followed by agriwaste and other biomass at 
0.33 MTOE and 0.54 MTOE, respectively. 
LPG and kerosene usage dropped by 7.3 percent 
and 21.4 percent, respectively. On the other hand, 
electricity consumption stood at 1.4 MTOE, down by 
1.3 percent from last year’s level of 1.3 MTOE though 
its share to the total sector’s demand slightly went up 
to 21.4 percent compared to its share of 20.7 percent 
in 2005. 
 
Industrial Sector
Final energy consumption of the industrial sector 
reached 5.39 MTOE in 2006, comprising almost 
one-fourth of the total energy consumption during the 
year. Majority of which, or about 96.4 percent was 
consumed by manufacturing industries. The remaining 
3.6 percent were used by construction and mining 
(Figure 10). 
by electricity at 24.9 percent and almost equally the 
rest is shared by coal (21.8 percent) and biomass 
(23.3 percent). 
 
The industry sector grew by only 1.9 percent 
because of the routinary performance of the mining 
industry. The manufacturing sector, however, remained 
stable, accelerating by 2.0 percent particularly on 
account of food and beverages, electrical machinery, 
iron and steel and non-ferrous metals.7 The reduction 
in the sector’s energy consumption however, was 
indicative of the decline in its energy intensity. 
On the other hand, the mining sub-sector’s energy 
consumption rose by 28.4 percent particularly on 
the use of diesel, fuel oil and LPG. Surprisingly, its 
production decreased by 6.8 percent due to lower 
yields of major mines and various small scale mines 
(e.g. gold, copper, and crude oil).8 In contrast, there 
was a notable decrease in the energy intensity of the 
construction sub-sector with 10.7 percent decrease in 
energy consumption vis-à-vis 4.7 percent growth in 
the gross value added (GVA).
Commercial Sector
Production performance of the commercial 
or service sector based on the GVA of 2005 and 
2006 showed that private services, trade and 
finance contributed the highest growth to the overall 
performance of the sector.9 
In 2006, final energy consumption of the sector 
increased by 4.7 percent from 1.96 MTOE in 2005 
to 2.05 MTOE in 2006. Electricity (57.2 percent) 
showed the highest share of the sector’s energy 
consumption with petroleum products (28.1 percent) 
having the second largest share and biomass (14.7 
percent) as fuel substitutes (Figure 11). Electricity 
continued to provide the fuel requirements of the 
commercial sector primarily for lighting and space 
cooling. Electricity consumption of the sector grew by 
3.9 percent from 1.13 MTOE in 2005 to 1.17 MTOE 
in 2006.
As the price of crude oil in the world market 
remained volatile, the sector’s consumption of LPG 
declined by 2.6 percent in 2006. Diesel consumption 
on the other hand, rose by 35.9 percent from 0.12 
MTOE in 2005 to 0.17 in 2006. Similarly, fuel 
oil increase by 3.4 percent during the period. The

release of the FY 2006 National Income AccountsNote: basic metals 
Petroleum product consumption fell by 7.3 
percent due to the lower use in the manufacturing 
and construction sub-sectors. Meanwhile, electricity 
use went up by 1.4 percent. On the other hand, coal 
consumption rose by 11.2 percent mainly due to the

B. OUTLOOK
PRIMARY ENERGY SUPPLY
Total primary energy supply is expected to grow 
at an annual average rate of 3.3 percent, translating 
to a yearly average volume of 48.93 MTOE across 
the entire planning period. Primary energy supply will 
comprise of 58.0 percent annual average share of 
indigenous energy and around 42.0 percent annual 
average share of imported energy. Indigenous energy, 
likewise, is projected to register an annual average 
volume of 28.38 MTOE while an average volume of 
20.55 MTOE is expected to be sourced from other 
countries during the planning period. 
Indigenous Energy Supply
Indigenous energy will be comprised of fossil fuels 
such as oil, gas and coal, and renewable energy like 
geothermal, hydro, wind, solar, and other biomass. 
From 2007 to 2014, indigenous energy will account 
an annual average share of 29.0 percent production 
of fossil fuels and 71.0 percent annual average share 
of renewable energy sources.
Local production of oil and condensate is projected 
to increase by an average of 10.4 percent from 2007 
to 2010 on account of the expected production from 
Malampaya field by 2010 and an additional production 
from Galoc by 2009. The combination of these fields 
will yield an estimated average annual production of 
2.69 MTOE during the planning period.
Natural gas, being the largest indigenous fossil 
fuel source, is estimated to account for around 
10.6 percent share of the total indigenous energy

increase may be attributed to the additional power 
back-up requirement of the commercial buildings and 
the mobility needs of trading services. 
Among the biomass resources, fuel wood 
utilization increased by 1.0 from last year’s level of 
0.15 MTOE. This can be attributed to the increased 
activity in commercial establishments like food chains, 
restaurants and hotels, spurred by the dynamic 
developments in the tourism sector. 
 
Agriculture Sector
The agriculture sector remained the least energy 
intensive among the country’s economic sectors, 
accounting for merely 1.3 percent share of the country’s 
total final energy demand in 2006. The sector’s total 
energy consumption dropped considerably by 10.0 
percent from last year’s 0.31 MTOE to 0.28 MTOE 
in 2006.

products used by the sector decreased by 11.2 percent 
from 0.27 MTOE to 0.24 MTOE for the period in 
review. Among the petroleum products, diesel was the 
most consumed fuel for commercial fishing which is 
used to fuel fishing boats, crop production, and other

from Semirara, Antique while a significant amount 
will be sourced from prospective fields in Cebu as 
well as other areas of Luzon and Mindanao.
production of these resources will post an average 
growth rate of 0.5 percent.
Following the implementation of the Biofuels Act of 
2006, appropriate programs in plantation, fertilization 
and/or expansion for coconut and sugarcane and 
other development requirement shall be implemented 
to increase the indigenous supply source potential for 
biofuels. 
To date, there are already nine accredited 
CME producers in the country while application for 
accreditation of one company is still under review. 
The aggregate capacity of these plants is estimated at 
287,620,000 liters per year.
Meanwhile, the San Carlos Bio-energy in Negros 
Occidental, which has a production capacity of 
100,000 liters of ethanol per day, is expected to be 
operational in early 2009. The growth of bio-ethanol 
industry requires setting up of additional facilities and 
providing additional services related to bio-ethanol 
utilization. 
The combined increasing demand for ethanol and 
CME will require an annual average volume of 0.34 
MTOE or an annual average increase in production of 
40.0 percent over the planning period.
Imported Energy Supply
To meet the escalating energy requirements of a 
growing economy, the country will continue to rely 
partly on imported fuel, particularly fossil fuels such as 
oil and coal.
Imported oil and oil products will account for 
the bulk share of 75.0 percent of total imports with 
an annual average growth of 3.8 percent over the 
planning period. 
Meanwhile, with coal currently being the leastcost option for power generation, coal importation is 
projected to increase at an average annual rate of 1.8 
percent which will translate to a yearly average volume 
of 5.22 MTOE. 
FINAL ENERGY DEMAND
The country’s total final energy demand is 
projected to increase annually by 3.3 percent from 
2007 to 2014. The country’s energy consumption is 
expected to reach 30.69 MTOE by 2014 from 24.53 
Energy Supply and De
Geothermal production will increase at an annual 
average growth of 2.0 percent or 10.24 MTOE average

Hydropower will remain to make a significant 
contribution in the total primary energy supply for the 
planning period. Production will grow by an average 
of 1.3 percent with an estimated average volume of 
2,25 MTOE.

percent in the total energy demand. Likewise, the 
growing population and burgeoning local industries is 
expected to trigger increased electricity consumption 
which is projected to grow by 5.2 percent annually. 
Meanwhile, propelled by the industrial sector such 
as cement manufacturing, slightly higher coal 
consumption is expected, recording an average 
increase of 1.2 percent annually.
Energy Demand by Sector
Transport Sector
Energy consumption for transport, the largest 
energy consuming sector, is projected to grow at an 
annual average rate of 3.2 percent over the planning 
period. The sector is expected to use up 34.3 percent 
of the country’s total energy demand. 
Oil remains to be the dominant fuel of the 
sector, accounting for 96.4 percent share in the total 
consumption, primarily for land transport use.
With the passage of the Biofuels Act of 2006, 
mandating specific biofuels blend, demand for CME 
and ethanol is projected to grow with a combined 
annual average growth rate of 42.1 percent during 
the reference period. This projection is based on the 
average annual growth rate of diesel and gasoline 
demand from 2007 to 2014.
Residential Sector
Households, the second largest energy-consuming 
sector, is foreseen to use up 27.8 percent of the 
country’s total energy requirement over the planning 
period, however, the use of biomass in the residential 
sector is foreseen to decline by 0.6 percent yearly 
owing to the continuing fuel shift to LPG particularly 
for domestic cooking. By this, consumption of LPG 
and kerosene is expected to rise at an average rate 
of 2.9 percent annually over the next ten years.

A. REVITALIZING THE EXPLORATION 
AND DEVELOPMENT OF 
INDIGENOUS RESOURCES
OIL AND GAS
The petroleum sector continues to work in attracting 
additional investments to develop more productive oil 
and gas fields. Thus, the 2007 Plan Update focuses on 
the sector’s goals of increasing the country’s oil and gas 
resources by 20.0 percent at the end of the planning 
period and increasing local production from other 
indigenous energy sources. Increasing production from 
indigenous hydrocarbon resources is a major pillar of 
the nation’s energy independence agenda.
Performance Assessment
With the launching of the PECR, there is a resurgent 
interest on the country’s upstream petroleum sector among 
local and foreign investors. As shown in Table 1, the 
country now has 28 service contracts (SC). Four of these 
were approved under PECR 2005 and three negotiated 
SCs were firmed up in 2006. Work programs under 
contracts awarded in 2005 and 2006 have committed 
investments of about US$ 155.1 million and US$ 46.2 
million, respectively. Thus, the country’s active service 
contracts will enhance the possibility of new commercial 
resource discoveries. A 10.0 percent likely success ratio 
of these contracts would also yield substantial reduction 
in crude oil importation and bring the country closer to 
meeting its goal of higher energy independence. 
Based on work program commitments for 2007, 
five wells will be drilled in Northwest Palawan, Visayas, 
Ragay Gulf, Mindoro-Cuyo and the East Visayan Basin 
by four service contractors, to wit: 
� Malaysia’s Petronas Carigali Overseas Bhd. to 
drill one exploration well in offshore Mindoro;
� Galoc Production Company to drill two horizontal 
production wells within the Galoc sub-block or SC14C in Northwest Palawan between August and 
October; and,
� Japan Petroleum Exploration Philippines, Ltd. 
(JAPEX) is committed to drill one exploration well 
over offshore Tañon Strait under SC 46.
In view of the positive results of the PECR, the DOE 
conducted another bidding round in December 2006. 
Offered in PECR 2006 were nine areas covering 
72,639 square kilometers (sq. kms.) for exploration 
and development. These sites are located in Central 
Luzon, Cagayan, Mindoro-Cuyo, East Palawan and 
Agusan-Davao. The DOE expects to award the PECR 
2006 service contracts before the end of 2007. 
Exploration and Production
The year 2006 saw significant increases in 
production of oil, gas and condensates. Production 
of crude oil reached 0.18 million barrels (MMB) for 
the year or a 7.1 percent increase from its 2006 
target of 0.17 MMB. On the other hand, production 
of natural gas reached 108,606 million cubic feet of 
gas (MMCFG) equivalent to a 23.0 percent gain from 
its 2006 target of 88,323 MMCFG. Simultaneous with 
the production of natural gas, the Malampaya gas field 
also produced condensate with actual output reaching 
5.1 MMB for the year. 
Acquisition of geophysical, principally seismic 
data was conducted throughout the year to determine 
and delineate underlying structures that could hold 
significant amount of hydrocarbon resources. For Energy Indepen
The DOE, in collaboration with various petroleum 
exploration companies, has started the study and 
evaluation of previously marginal fields such as the 
Galoc and Octon fields in offshore Palawan. The 
exploration firm, Galoc Production Company will 
commence the development of Galoc oilfield in the 
Northwest Palawan basin in 2007. The work plan 
includes the committed drilling of two horizontal wells 
and one optional well. Likewise, oilfields in current 
state of suspended operations (West Linapacan and 
Cadlao) are being considered for rehabilitation.
Measurable Sectoral Targets
The exploration program of active SCs is expected 
to increase the country’s proven oil and gas resources 
to 20.0 percent within the planning period 2007 to 
2014. Likewise, a total of 40 wells are programmed 
for drilling, majority of which are offshore wells.
Recent developments led to some adjustments in the 
a) Oil production from the Malampaya oil leg 
shall commence by 2010 to run up to 2013.
b) Cadlao field shall be reactivated and 
production is seen to start by 2012 at 1,700 
barrels of oil per day (BOPD) for ten years.
c) Galoc field shall be developed to commence 
production by 2009.
d) Daily gas production of 1 million standard 
cubic feet (MMSCF) from the San Antonio 
gas field will be enhanced with the scheduled 
replacement of the current gas turbine into a 
more efficient one.
e) Libertad gas field will be developed and 
production is expected by 2009.
In view of the above, production targets (Annex 
A.1.5) show that the country’s existing oil and gas 
fields will yield about 37.4 MMB of oil and 1,138 BCF 
of gas for the planning period. Oil production from the 
Malampaya oil leg is expected to commence by 2010 
with an initial production of 8.76 MMB. On the other

Acquisition of new geophysical data over the 
planning period is expected to cover 22,400 linekilometers of 2D seismic data and 3,600 sq.kms. of 
3D seismic data. 
Development Challenges
� Promotion/marketing of marginal fields or those 
fields with resources considered “less profitable”
for development such as those found in the 
Maniguin in Panay Island, Calauit and West 
Linapacan in Palawan and South Cebu and 
Libertad fields in the Visayas. 
� Isolated but lingering opposition by some NGOs 
to oil exploration has complicated and delayed 
seismic surveys. 
� Worldwide boom in hydrocarbon exploration has 
made it difficult for some service contractors to 
acquire drilling rig and seismic boat services in 
time.
Action Plan
For the 2007 Plan Update, the upstream petroleum 
sector goal has been modified to focus on achieving a 
20.0 percent increase in oil and gas resources instead 
of reserves as stipulated in the 2006 Plan Update. The 
modified target is more quantifiable since it is verified 
through the acquisition, processing and interpretation 
of new/additional seismic data. 
To meet the twin goals of increasing resources and 
boosting indigenous oil and gas production, the DOE 
has identified the following courses of action:
Increase oil and gas resources by 20.0 
percent
� Improve prospectivity to increase acreage for offer 
under the PECR to draw more investment interest 
in the country’s petroleum resources. This will be 
done through the evaluation of prospective areas 
to be offered in the bid rounds, promotion of the 
bid rounds in international promotion activities. The 
DOE shall also assist petroleum contractors by closely 
monitoring and supervising agreed geological and 
geophysical work commitments stipulated in the 
SCs. This would include the conduct of seismic 
activities to cover 30,000 line-kilometers, basin 
Table 2. OIL AND GAS MEASURABLE TARGETS
activities to determine economic viability of newly 
discovered oil and gas fields.
� Enhance fiscal incentives through the review 
of existing laws on oil and gas exploration and 
development. Likewise, special incentives shall be 
formulated for investors willing to further assess/
develop marginal or “less prospective” basins. 
� Improve information database through the 
enhancement of the DOE webpage on petroleum 
to ensure information accessibility by foreign 
exploration companies. 
Increase oil and gas production
� To meet the production target of 10.36 MMB of oil 
and 2.24 BCF of gas from undeveloped marginal 
fields, there is a need to further evaluate and assess 
previously discovered marginal fields or existing 
oil fields, which have been considered as “noneconomic.” Along this context, the medium and 
long-term activities would include encouraging 
service contractors/investors to undertake the 
application of innovative technologies in the 
development of these fields. In due course, the 
DOE will work on amending Presidential Decree 
(P.D.) 87 or the Oil Exploration and Development 
Act of 1972 to provide additional incentives to 
prospective investors.

COAL
The government will continue to develop the 
country’s indigenous coal resources to fuel the country’s 
energy requirements. Environmental concerns will be 
addressed through regular and proper monitoring of 
coal mines and the promotion of emerging clean coal 
technologies. 
Performance Assessment
The Philippines has about 19 coal districts that 
contain significant coal deposits. Such deposits are 
found in the areas of Batan Island, Bukidnon, CagayanIsabela, Catanduanes, Cebu, Davao, Maguindanao. 
Masbate, Mindoro Negros, Quezon-Polilio, SamarLeyte, Sarangani, Semirara, Sorsogon, Surigao del Sur, 
Sultan Kudarat, Quirino, and Zamboanga Sibugay. 
Total coal resources in these areas are estimated at 
about 2.3 billion metric tons.
In 2006, the country’s in-situ reserves stood at 
323.3 million metric tons (MMMT), registering a 
3.0 percent increase from its 2006 target of 313.2 
MMMT. This is mainly due to the exploration activities 
conducted by the new coal exploration contractors 
of the DOE. As of December 2006, the country 
has 38 active coal operating contracts (COCs) 
with development, production and exploration 
commitments. A new COC to develop and explore 
the coal resources in Negros Occidental was issued 
in 2006. This is in addition to 15 COCs awarded to 
11 local companies in 2005 for the exploration and 
development of coal areas in Southern Luzon, Cebu 
and Mindanao.
The country’s coal operating contractors produced 
2.3 MMMT or about 1.0 MMMT less than the targeted 
3.3 MMMT. Contribution came largely from largescale coal mines as it accounted for 97.0 percent of 
mining areas of Cebu and Albay, and the damages 
wrought by typhoons Milenyo and Reming during 
the last quarter of 2006, contributed to the drop in 
production. 
Under the PECR 2006, 14 coal prospective 
areas were offered to investors for exploration and 
development. Areas for offer are found in the following 
sites: (a) Bayawan City, Negros Oriental; (b) Bunawan, 
Agusan del Sur; (c) Calatrava, Negros Occidental; 
(d) Danao City, Cebu; (e) Gen. Nakar, Quezon; (f) 
Cagwait-Marihatag, Surigao del Sur; (g) Gigaguit, 
Surigao del Norte; (h) Kitcharao, Surigao del Norte; 
(i) Naga, Cebu; (j) Siay, Zamboanga Sibugay; (k) 
San Agustin-Lianga, Surigao del Sur; (l) Tandag-Tago, 
Surigao del Sur; (m) Tarragona, Davao Oriental; and 
(n) Trento, Agusan del Sur. 
The DOE started the drafting and subsequently 
initiated consultations on the amended Small-Scale 
Coal Mining (SSCM) Circular, the Coal Mine Safety 
Rules and Regulations, as well as the circular on 
Coalbed Methane (CBM). The revision on these 
circulars governing coal mine operations in the country 
is timely in view of the increased interest in the use of 
coal in the power generation sector and the cement 
manufacturing industry. Operations of small-scale coal 
mining are also being encouraged as these provide 
employment and livelihood opportunities for host 
communities. 
Representations made with the Environmental 
Management Bureau (EMB) of the Department of 
Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) led to 
modified requirements for the grant of Environmental 
Compliance Certificate (ECC) to coal mining 
operations. As a result, the Procedural Manual 
for the implementation of DENR Department A.O. 
No. 30, Series of 2003 was effectively amended 
through the issuance of Memorandum Circular No. 
005. The circular provides that small-scale coal 
mining operations (or those with annual production 
of 20,000 MT and below) need only to provide 
an Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) checklist 
to secure their ECC. Coal mining operations with 
annual coal production of more than 20,000 MT but 
not exceeding 70,000 MT will just be required to 
provide an IEE Report. A full blown EIA is required 
only for coal mine operations with annual committed 
production of more than 70,000 MT.
 
To effectively monitor the country’s coal flow and 
update the coal market database, research works 
were conducted with various coal end-users. Results of 
Energy IndepenMMMT by 2014, the bulk of which will be sourced 
from Mindanao, particularly in Region XII. Production 
is estimated to maintain its 3.0-MMMT level for the 
period 2007-2008. This is expected to gradually 
reach the 5.0-MMMT mark by 2011 due to increased 
contribution from coal-producing areas in Central 
Philippines and the Mindanao Super Regions. Region VI 
remains the biggest source of the country’s indigenous 
coal. By 2014, production is expected to hit a record 
high of 6.6 MMMT to contribute to the sector’s goal 
of increasing its self-sufficiency target level. Projected 
coal production will fuel the coal-fired power plants 
located in Antique, Sultan Kudarat, Surigao, Cagayan 
and Isabela, which are scheduled to be commissioned 
within the planning period. 
Development Challenges
� Need for a policy issuance mandating the use of 
Clean Coal Technologies (CCT) among existing and 
new coal end-users to improve local coal consumption 
and at the same time ensure the conformity of coal 
utilization to environmental standards.
� Need to study the impact to cost of power 
generation and retail electricity prices of using 
indigenous coal with CCT.
� Improvement of guidelines/strategies on the conduct 
of Information, Education and Communication (IEC) 
campaign activities on the use of local coal as an 
acceptable fuel for power generation.
Action Plan
The DOE will pursue activities to increase indigenous 
Coalbed Methane and Related Coal Resources in 
the Philippines to be conducted jointly by the DOE 
and the U.S. Geological Survey of the Department 
of Interior under the Memorandum of Understanding 
(MOU) signed between the United States and the 
Philippines on 07 March 2007. Coalbed methane is 
natural gas found in coal beds and used for a variety 
of purposes ranging from domestic, commercial and 
industrial to electric power generation. Methane is 
generally considered a cleaner form of energy and 
cost-effective as well, considering that exploration 
and extraction costs are low. Initially, the project will 
collect, analyze, compile, synthesize, interpret, and 
publish critical new data on coalbed methane and 
coal resources in the coalfields and on recoverable 
coal mine methane (CMM) and abandoned mine 
methane (AMM) reserves in the coal mine areas of 
the Philippines. 
 The project is ultimately intended to assist coal 
operating contractors in identifying their estimated 
coalbed methane resources. In addition, it will 
provide technical assistance and technology 
transfer on the use of coalbed methane for the 
contractors’ own power requirements. 
 
� Another project to be implemented is the Mine 
Safety, Rescue and Emergency Preparedness in 
Coal Mining Project which promotes safety in mining 
operations. Among its main objectives is to minimize 
the occurrence of mine accident particularly methane 
gas explosion. It will also implement a program 
aimed at promoting safety among coal operators 
and coal mine workers in the country.
� A continuing activity of the DOE for the planning 
period is the Coal to Market Linkage Program which 
aims to update database on coal specifications of 
end-users and supplier technologies on coal utilization 
and handling. This would serve as basis for future 
development studies, policies and plans on coal.
� To sustain the projected demand for coal during 
the planning period, coal blocks will continue 
to be offered in the PECR. Activities attendant to 
the conduct of contracting rounds include the 
prioritization of coal areas to be offered, evaluation 
of submitted proposals vis-à-vis the PECR criteria, 
and the subsequent awarding of development/
exploration contracts to qualified bidders. Likewise, 
the DOE will identify and promote small-scale coal 
mining areas for possible development.

� Drafting and implementation 
of policies on the use of 
indigenous coal and clean coal 
technology are expected within 
the planning period to address 
marketability and environmental 
issues of indigenous coal. Other 
strategies to promote the use 
of indigenous coal include the 
conduct of information campaign

conduct of training/seminars on 
safe and efficient coal mining 
practices, as well as the pursuit 
of environmental programs and 
innovative technologies for the 
reduction of coal emissions and

period. Meanwhile, assessed 
potential wind sites promise a huge 
contribution to the achievement of 
the envisioned double capacity 
from renewable energy. 
Geothermal
Performance Assessment
Development of geothermal 
energy potential is continuously 
being pursued to increase its share in 
the over-all energy mix and support 
the country’s bid in becoming the 
largest producer of geothermal 
energy in the world. In the 2006 
primary energy portfolio, the share 
of geothermal energy stood at 22.8 
percent compared to 21.5 percent in 
2005. Meanwhile, gross electricity 
generated from geothermal resource 
stood at 10,465 GWh in 2006 
exhibiting an increase of 5.7 percent 
As a result of the increase in 
the electricity generation, fuel oil 
displaced increased from 17.07 
MMBFOE in 2005 to 18.03 
MMBFOE in 2006. Due primarily 
to the continuous oil price increase, 
foreign exchange savings also 
increased from US$ 873.46 million 
in 2005 to US$1,140.72 million in 
2006.
The completion of rehabilitation 
works for MakBan and Tiwi 
geothermal power plants in the 
last quarter of 2005 resulted in the 
increased power plant capacities of 
32.8 MW and 14 MW, respectively. 
Moreover, PNOC-EDC’s10 first 
merchant power plant – the 49.4 
MW Northern Negros Geothermal 
Power Plant (NNGPP) – started its

namely: the 20-MW Mabini in Batangas, 20 to 40-MW 
Biliran in Biliran Province and 20 to 40-MW Amacan in 
Compostela Valley. Once harnessed, these fields could 
add about 60 to 100 MW additional capacity. 
Measurable Sectoral Targets
Potential capacity addition of 699.4 MW from 
geothermal resource could be harnessed within the 
planning period. Bulk of such additional capacity shall 
come from the Central Philippines with a total capacity 
of 269.4 MW, while the Mindanao Super Region has 
a total of 170-MW potential capacities that could be 
tapped. From these capacity additions, the 20-MW 
Nasulo Geothermal Power Project in Palinpinon, Negros

Project are already committed and expected to be 
available both in 2010. 
To further accelerate the utilization of geothermal 
and increase its share in the energy mix, around 236 
wells are envisioned to be drilled within the planning 
period by the private sector (Table 6) in pursuit of 
developing new geothermal areas and expanding the 
existing steam fields. On the other hand, the private 
sector will be encouraged to undertake the drilling of 
the remaining wells located outside the PNOC-EDC 
contracted areas. 
Development Challenge
Foreign investors are restricted to a maximum of 
40.0 percent ownership of any geothermal venture. 
This legal provision is a major stumbling block to the 
entry of foreign investors, holding back more extensive 
development of the country’s geothermal resources.
Action Plan
As part of government’s bid to becoming the world 
leader in geothermal energy, the following strategies 
� Monitor closely the exploration and development 
of awarded geothermal areas. 
� Conduct reservoir and production studies for 
optimized utilization of geothermal resources 
in existing power plants. Optimization projects 
shall likewise be encouraged from the service 
contractors.
� Pursue optimization of low-temperature geothermal 
energy by promoting the cascading scheme 
of development through the project: “Resource 
Assessment of Low-Enthalpy Geothermal Resources 
in the Philippines.” This will be implemented over a 
five-year period to commence in 2007. The project 
aims to promote and accelerate the development 
of small and low enthalpy geothermal resources 
in the Philippines through the conduct of detailed 
geo-scientific investigations, socio-economic and 
environmental baseline studies on identified small 
and low enthalpy geothermal resource areas.
� Pursue the implementation of the Memorandum of 
Agreement (MOA) between DOE, PNOC and the 
local government of Puerto Princesa, Palawan. 
 The MOA provides for the assessment of Palawan’s 
geothermal energy resources for power and nonpower utilization. 
� Enhance policy framework in the development of 
geothermal energy through the following policy 
initiatives: 
 Formulation of a Department Circular (D.C.) 
for the direct use of geothermal energy for 
non-power applications
 Seek Department of Justice (DOJ) Opinion 
on possible review of P.D. 1442, “An Act to 
Promote the Exploration and Development of 
Geothermal Resources,” allowing 100 percent 
foreign equity participation in geothermal 
projects. 
Hydropower
Performance Assessment
In 2006, the country’s total installed capacity from 
hydropower stood at 3,257 MW. The 345-MW San

Note: Please refer to Annex A.1.711 mini-hydro projects were given 
such permit during the 1st quarter of 
2007. Feasibility studies for these 
projects are still being undertaken. 
There were 14 hydropower 
projects with feasibility studies, 
which are estimated to provide 
an additional 255.2 MW to the 
country’s existing hydropower 
capacity. These are being 
undertaken by following developers: 
Solution Using Renewable Energy 
(SURE), Province of Biliran, PNOCEDC/SOLUZIONA, Chase Makros 
Management, Inc. (CMMI), Benguet 
Power Resources Development 
Corp., First Gen Visayas Hydro 
Power Corporation, and the Sta. 
Clara Power Corporation. Two of 
these projects will proceed to the 
construction phase, namely: (a) 
Colasi in Mercedez, Camarines 
Norte; and, (b) Sipangpang in 
Cantilan, Surigao del Sur projects 
with potential capacity of 1 MW 
each. Both projects are expected 
to be completed in 2009.
Meanwhile, the DOE 
continuously supervises the ongoing constructions of committed 
mini-hydropower projects. These 
stand-alone projects will provide a 
total of 4.6 MW in different areas 
of the country by 2008. Table 
8 shows the details of projects’ 
ongoing constructions.
Measurable Sectoral 
Targets
The 2007 Plan Update identifies 
41 hydropower projects consisting 
of 10 large hydropower (924.8 
MW) and 31 mini-hydropower 
(100.3 MW) projects or an 
aggregate capacity of 1,025.1 
MW (Table 7). The Metro Luzon 
Urban Beltway and Mindanao 
regions host the greater bulk of 
the potential projects with total 
capacity of 368 MW and 369.8 
MW, respectively.

Development Challenges
� Encouraging greater private 
sector participation in the 
development of hydropower 
with the immediate passage of 
the Renewable Energy Bill. 
� Limited interested developers 
due to high initial investment 
costs.
Action Plan 
Administer R.A. 7156 (MiniHydropower Law) with enhanced 
participation of the Market Service 
Center (MSC) created under the 
Capacity Building to Remove 
Barriers to Renewable Energy 
Development (CBRED) project.
BIOMASS, SOLAR, 
WIND 
To further promote the wide 
scale use of renewable energy 
sources, about 740.4 MW of 
indicative capacities from biomass, 
solar, and wind energy sources are 
identified for possible development. 
About 556.5 MW will come 
from wind power projects and 
the balance of 183.9 MW from 
biomass.
Biomass
Performance Assessment 
Renewable energy from 
biomass is targeted to contribute 
122 MW to the overall energy selfsufficiency target of 60.0 percent 
in 2010. Initiatives from private 
sectors provide a good indication 
on the potential of biomass energy 
development in the country. This 
is evidenced by the 12-MW 
Cogeneration Plant of JG Summit 
Holdings, Inc. in Negros Oriental 
endorsed by DOE to the Board of 
Investments for registration under 
the Omnibus Investment Code. 
Said cogeneration plant will use 
the bagasse generated from the 
sugar milling operations of the 
Kabankalan, Negros Occidental 
and Manjuyod, Negros Oriental 
sugar mills and refineries of 
Universal Robina Corporation, one 
of the subsidiaries of JG Summit 
Holdings, Inc.
Committed Projects
In the municipalities of San 
Manuel, Cabatuan and Luna in 
Isabela province, own-use ricehull 
cogeneration plants are expected 
to provide an additional capacity 
generation of 5 MW by 2008. 
Proponents of these projects are 
La Suerte Rice Mill, Family Choice 
Grains Processing Center and 
Golden Season Grain Center. 
 
On the other hand, by-product 
from sugar cane industry is providing 
an option for energy resource in the 
Central Philippines super region. The 
Central Azucarera de San Antonio 
in Passi, Iloilo has an ongoing 
pre-commissioning activities on 
bagasse cogeneration plant with 
15-MW capacity. Likewise, the 
municipality of Talisay in Negros 
Occidental through its proponent, the 
First Farmers Holdings, Inc. is 40.0 
percent complete in the construction 
of the physical structure of a 30-MW 
bagasse cogeneration plant. Both 
cogeneration plants are planned to

Wind 
Performance Assessment
Wind power in the country 
is gaining interest from potential 
investors. A total of seven 
applications for Production-Sharing 
Contracts (PSC), such as PreCommercial Contract (PCC) and PreNegotiated Commercial Contract 
(PNCC), have been processed. 
The PCC covers the detailed wind 
resource assessment and feasibility 
study phase while PNCC covers the 
actual project implementation or 
commercial phase.
The PNOC-EDC – the country’s 
(Ilocos Norte) while the UPC Asias 
application covers areas located 
at Burgos and Pagudpud both in 
Ilocos Norte.
The DOE monitored the activities 
of six wind sites with existing PCCs. 
It is expected that ongoing activities 
would lead to the development and 
implementation of wind projects in 
the contract areas. 
Committed Project
Phase 2 of the wind project in 
Bangui, Ilocos Norte is targeted 
for commissioning in 2008 with 
Northwind Power Development 
Corp. as the proponent. The project 
is expected to provide additional 8-
MW capacity addition to the Luzon 
grid.
Indicative Projects
Additional capacity of 556.5 
MW is expected from 23 indicative 
wind sites during the planning 
period (Table 10). Indicative 
projects of 333 MW potential 
capacity additions located in North 
Luzon Agribusiness Quadrangle 
as well as those in Metro Luzon 
Urban Beltway (113.4 MW), 
Central Philippines (95.1 MW) and 
Mindanao Agribusiness (15 MW) 
can either be connected to grid or 
off-grid. 
Solar
Performance Assessment 
The 25-MW initial capacity 
of the Sunpower Solar Wafer 
Fabrication Plant was raised to 50 
MW in 2005 and increased further 
to 108 MW in 2006. It is planned 
to gradually increase its capacity 
to 400 MW by 2010. Photovoltaic 
battery charging stations installed 
in the year under review with the 
capacity of 110.4 kWp were able 
to energize 3,680 households in

B. INCREASE USE OF 
ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORT FUELS
 The intensified development and utilization 
of alternative fuels for transport use is seen as a 
continuing strategy to reduce the country’s dependence 
on imported oil. It also provides a viable solution to 
cushion the impact of highly volatile petroleum prices 
to the economy as well as promote clean and ecologyfriendly energy sources. 
The major alternative fuels being promoted are 
biofuels that include biodiesel and bioethanol, autogas 
and compressed natural gas (CNG). Prospect on 
the use of jatropha curcass as a potential biodiesel 
feedstock is also being explored.
Performance Assessment
Biofuels
The signing of R.A. 9367, “An Act to Direct the 
Use of Biofuels, Establishing for this Purpose the Biofuels 
Program, Appropriating Funds thereof, and for other 
Purposes,” otherwise known as the Biofuels Act of 2006, 
on 12 January 2007 by President G. M. Arroyo provides 
the impetus for the full development and utilization of 
biofuels in the country. Said Act mandates the use of 
biofuels and establishes the National Biofuels Program 
to ensure a sustained investment climate for production, 
distribution, and utilization of biodiesel and bioethanol. 
mandated under the law to monitor and evaluate the 
implementation of the National Biofuels Program. 
The Biofuels Act of 2006 seeks to reduce dependence 
on imported fuels with due regard to the protection of 
environment and consistent with the country’s sustainable 
economic growth thrust to expand opportunities for 
livelihood, specifically in the countryside. With the 
regulatory environment in place, the development of 
the local biofuels industry will accelerate government’s 
efforts towards attaining energy self-sufficiency.
The Biofuels Act of 2006 was signed by Pres. Arroyo in ceremonies held 
on 12 January 2007 in Malacañang.
The importance of biofuels was highlighted during 
the 24th ASEAN Ministers on Energy Meeting (AMEM) 
held in Vientiane, Lao PDR in July 2006. Emphasis 
was given on the need for closer cooperation and 
exchange of experience among ASEAN countries in 
promoting the development, production and utilization 
of biofuels, including the relevant fiscal incentives, 
funding facilities and regulatory infrastructures. 
Similarly, the East Asia-ASEAN Declaration on Energy 
Security,12 acknowledged the significance of biofuels 
as one of the measures in realizing the common goals 
of Regional Energy Security. 
Biodiesel 
Coco Methyl Ester (CME). The government 
continued to implement and monitor compliance to 
Memorandum Circular No. 55 issued on 09 February 
2004, “Directing all government agencies, including 
government-owned and controlled corporations to 
incorporate the use of one percent (1%) by volume 
in their diesel requirements.” The total number of 
government agencies complying with M.C. 55 has 
increased from 59 agencies (1,100 diesel-fuelled 
vehicles) in 2005 to 127 agencies (1,542 dieselfuelled vehicles) in 2006. 
11 The NBB is composed of the DOE Secretary as Chairman and the 
Secretaries of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), DOST, 
Department of Agriculture (DA), Department of Finance (DOF), 
Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE)and the Administrators 
Energy Indepen126 (13 August 2005), and 110-A (27 March 2006), 
which deal on government austerity measures, energy 
conservation program and Government Energy 
Management Program, respectively. 
To ensure a stable supply of CME in the market, 
the DOE approved the accreditation of Romtron, Inc. 
in Odiongan, Romblon and Pure Essence International, 
Inc. in Quezon City. Currently under review is the 
application of Mount Holly Coco Biodiesel Plant in 
Lucena City. These new entrants are in addition to the 
first two approved manufacturing companies in 2005, 
namely: Senbel Fine Chemicals, Inc. and Chemrez, Inc., 
which are now very much active in the manufacturing 
and marketing of CME. 
As of end-2006, local CME production reached 
111.9 million liters while sales of manufacturers/
retailers reached 655,401 liters of pure CME and 
32.3 million liters of the CME blend (B1). The B1 blend 
is commercially available in 38 stations of Flying V 
with the same price as pure petroleum diesel. On the 
other hand, the first Biofuels Center was launched at 
the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) Compound in 
Quezon City in February 2006 to serve as venue to all 
IEC-related activities. 
The Philippine National Standard (PNS) for pure 
CME has been promulgated while the Technical 
Committee on Petroleum Products and Additives 
(TCPPA) is formulating the PNS for the B1 blend. On the 
other hand, the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers 
of the Philippines, Incorporated (CAMPI) has stamped 
its approval on the 1.0 percent CME blend for diesel 
without any modification.
Jatropha Curcas (Tubang Bakod). In 
recognizing the importance of developing baseline 
information on the potential of jatropha as a viable 
feedstock for biodiesel, the government has embarked 
on intensive consultations with various stakeholders. 
Coordination meetings are continuously being carried 
out on technology exchange, resource assessment as 
well as on the various modes of processing jatropha 
oil to ensure capability in meeting the requirements of 
the program. 
To further address issues on supply security, 
resource assessment was also conducted in the cities 
of Davao and General Santos. In addition, the PNOCAlternative Fuels Corporation13 (PNOC-AFC) also 
planned to put up a jatropha plantation in Mindanao 
Geothermal Production Field in Kidapawan. 
nursery and plantation in two different locations. The 
MOU provides for the production of about 30 million 
seedlings by the Biogreen Energy to supply the PNOCAFC’s seed requirement for its 700,000 hectares of 
jatropha plantations in the country. 
With regard to product standard, the test protocol 
for jatropha methyl ester-diesel fuel blend is being 
formulated by the TCPPA. The DOE also conducted a 
test on jatropha oil as a possible fuel for plant oil stove 
in coordination with the Leyte State University. 
 
As part of building local capability, the DOE 
together with the DA, PCA and DOST participated in a 
study mission to India, a country known to have proven 
experiences in cultivating jatropha.
Bioethanol
The introduction of E10 (10.0 percent bioethanol 
blend) in the market was initiated by new industry players 
such as Seaoil and later, Flying V in at least four of its 
stations in Metro Manila. The Pilipinas Shell also launched 
the “Shell Super Unleaded E10” in 31 gasoline stations 
in Metro Manila with a 50-centavo cheaper price than its 
regular unleaded gasoline at the pumps. 
The government issued the following policy 
directives to encourage stakeholder participation in 
the program: 
a) E.O. 488 “Modifying the Rate of Import Duty 
on Components, Parts and Accessories for the 
Assembly of Hybrid, Electric, Flexible Fuel and 
CNG Motor Vehicles under Section 104 of the 
Tariff and Custom Code of 1978” issued on 
12 January 2006, allows importations under 
the Motor Vehicle Development Program at 
zero percent rated-import duty on parts and 
components that will be used for the assembly 
and manufacture of vehicles powered by 
alternative fuels; 
b) E.O. 449 “Modifying the Rates of Import Duty 
on Bioethanol Fuel under Section 104 of the 
Tariff and Customs Code of 1978” issued 
on 22 July 2005, reducing import duties on 
bioethanol products to be used in the program 
from 10.0 percent to 1.0 percent; 
c) Revenue Regulations No. 08-2006 issued 
in May 2006 by the Bureau of Internal 
Revenue (BIR) implementing the guidelines 
on the taxation and monitoring of bioethanol
Energy IndepenParticipants in the Bioethanol Program for the 
effective monitoring and implementation of 
the program while in the voluntary phase and 
in the preparation for a smooth transition to 
nationwide legislated mandate.
Meanwhile, the DOE has endorsed the proposals of 
local investors, such as JG Summit Holdings and Biofuels 
88 Corporation, who have signified their intention on 
bioethanol production to the BOI. It also endorsed the 
application of Zambo Norte Bioenergy Corporation to 
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
A major development in the program was the PhP 
1.0 billion investment commitment of Ford Philippines 
for the building of a flexible fuel engine plant in Sta. 
Rosa, Laguna. This was followed by the commercial 
launching of the first Ford Flexi-Fuel Vehicle (FFV) 
model in April 2006 to boost the country’s bid of 
becoming the ASEAN Center of Excellence for Flexible 
Fuel Technology. The FFV can run on regular gasoline 
or a blend of 85.0 percent ethanol (E85) and 15.0 
percent gasoline. 
Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)
Policy Initiatives. On 20 April 2006, the DOE 
issued D.C. No. 2006-04-0004 adopting D.C. No. 
2004-04-004 titled “Guidelines on the issuance of 
certificate of accreditation and certificate of authority 
to import under the Natural Gas Vehicle Program for 
Public Transport (NGVPPT)” as the implementing rules 
and regulations of E.O. Nos. 396 and 488 dated 31 
December 2004 and 12 January 2006, respectively, 
and D.C. No.2005-07-006 dated 05 July 2005 and 
amending certain provisions of the said D.C. No. 2004-
04-004.” The policy directive aims to ensure a unified 
and coordinated effort in establishing a successful and 
robust natural gas industry. The D.C. also puts in place 
a portfolio of incentives for private sector participation 
in the required logistics and infrastructure support to 
the program. 
Supply Infrastructure. The launching of the 
CNG mother station in Tabangao, Batangas and the 
daughter refilling station in Biñan, Laguna in October 
2007 will provide a strong boost to the use of CNG in 
the transport sector. Meanwhile, the DOE and PNOC 
jointly conducted a site inspection in the province of 
Batangas to look for a possible location of another 
mother station. 
 
Market Development. A total of 22 imported 
CNG-Original Equipment Manufactured (OEM) 
Pilot Pinoy CNG buses launched by Pres. Arroyo on 24 October 2007 
in Laguna to highlight the commercial operation of fi rst ever motherdaughter refi lling station.
(CAI) was issued to RRCG Transport and a preliminary 
evaluation for the application of accreditation for 
Grandstar and First CNG, Inc. was undertaken. 
For a continuous tie-up with the CNG-NGV 
industry at the international level, the DOE renewed 
its membership with the Asia Pacific Natural Gas 
Vehicle Association (ANGVA) on 28 February 2006. 
Coordination meetings are also continuously being 
held with the accredited bus operators14 for regular 
updates on the program. Meanwhile, the DOE has 
received expressions of interest from private entities/
companies to participate in the program.
In terms of promotional activities, a CNG threewheeler vehicle was showcased during the First National 
Conference and Exhibit on Tricycle Transportation 
Development held in Iloilo City on 28-30 June 2006. 
On the other hand, the Automobile Association of the 
Philippines Motorshow Exhibit held at the Philippine 
International Convention Center in May 2006 featured 
the DOE’s CNG demonstration units. 
 
As part of the study on CNG buses, the DOE 
conducted test runs from Taguig City to Cavite on 11-
13 January 2006 to determine its fuel efficiency and 
performance. Capacity building and IEC activities 
were organized for the stakeholders in collaboration 
with the United States Agency for International 
Development (USAID) and United States Department of 
Energy (USDOE). 
Standards Development. In November 
2005, two additional CNG/NGV standards were 
promulgated to guide the stakeholders in the effective 
implementation of NGVPPT, namely: DPNS NFPA: 
2005 (2002 Edition) on the CNG Vehicular Fuel 
Systems; and, DPNS ASME B3.3:2005 (2002 Edition) 
for the Process Piping Code.
Energy IndepenautoLPG industry in the country and protect the 
consuming public, the DOE issued D.C. No. 2007-
02-0002 “Providing for the Rules and Regulations 
Governing the Business of Supplying, Hauling, Storage, 
Marketing and Distribution of LPG for Automotive Use” 
on 13 February 2007. The D.C. aims to eliminate 
illegal and unsafe operation practices in the auto-LPG 
business and impose penalties on violations to health, 
safety and product quantity/quality standards. 
Supply Infrastructure. There is a growing 
demand of LPG use in the transport sector in view of the 
cheaper autoLPG prices as compared to conventional 
fuels. From nine dispensing stations, the number 
has abruptly increased to over 80 and continuously 
increasing, while the garage-based dispensing stations 
has totaled to 35. The inventory of existing dispensing 
pumps and their operators is as follows: Petron (13); 
NAIADDS (2), Petronas (13), Shell AutoLPG (11), 
Liquigaz (7), Total Phil. (2), Seaoil (1), and Pryce Gas 
(1). These dispensing pumps are located all over the 
country, though majority of these are found in Metro 
Manila. 
To monitor compliance to safety standards, the 
Technical Committee on Dispensing Station (DOE, 
DOST, LTO, DTI-BPS, DOLE and Fil-Car Foundation) 
regularly conducts inspection activities.
Market Development. There is also an 
increasing demand for autoLPG conversion. To date, a 
total of 19 autoLPG government-recognized conversion 
shops are currently operating in the country and there 
are about 7,000 autoLPG converted units throughout 
the country from only 800 units in 2005. The local 
transport operators have been encouraged to convert 
their units for autoLPG use considering the minimal 
cost of conversion kit ranging from PhP 24,000 to PhP 
55,000 per unit and the economic advantage of using 
low-cost priced LPG over conventional fuels whose 
prices are highly volatile. 
Standards Development. To ensure the 
protection and safety of the public and the industry in 
the use of auto-LPG and its technology, the DOE and 
DTI-BPS in coordination with the private sector have 
developed and promulgated four sets of auto-LPG 
standards in November 2006 namely: (1) PNS/UN 
ECE 67:2006 – Uniform provision concerning, (1.1) 
Approval of specific equipment of motor vehicles using 
liquefied petroleum gases in their propulsion system; 
(1.2) Approval of vehicle fitted with specific equipment 
for the use of liquefied petroleum gases in their propulsion 
system with regard to the installation of equipment; 
Stations. In October 2006, the DOE participated in 
the Public Consultation on Standards and Regulations 
for the effective implementation of the Philippine AutoLPG Program in Metro Manila. 
Measurable Sectoral Targets
Biofuels 
The implementation of Biofuels Act of 2006 is one 
of the many strategies that the government is taking 
seriously to mitigate our dependence on imported 
fuels. It is expected to impact in the country’s economic 
growth since it will accumulate savings through fuel 
displacement and opens up new opportunities for 
investments. 
Biodiesel (CME) 
Under R.A. 9367, the DOE envisage the 
nationwide blending of 1.0 percent biodiesel in all 
diesel-fuel requirements of the country commencing in 
May 2007 to reach 2.0 percent by 2009. The 1.0 
percent mandated blend would correspond to a total of 
64.4 million liters of diesel fuel displacement in 2008. 
Meanwhile, the 2.0 percent biodiesel blend, which 
shall start in 2009, is expected to displace a total of 
133.7 million liters of diesel fuel to reach 160.7 million 
liters by the end of the planning period (Table 11).

back the implementation of the NGVPPT resulting in 
corresponding adjustment in its target for this Plan 
Update. 
As a result of the inauguration of CNG motherdaughter stations in October 2007, 70 CNG buses 
are expected to be on commercial operation in 2009 
to increase to 200 the following year for the completion 
of the pilot phase implementation. The number of CNG 
buses will reach a total of 3,000 in 2014 for the full 
implementation of the program. In anticipation, ten 
CNG daughter stations will be put up by 2010 and 
additional five CNG refilling station by 2014. 
 
Development Challenges
Biofuels
The government is keen on expanding the utilization 
of biofuels blend in the areas of power, shipping, air 
transport and other industries. In this context, the DOE 
has identified issues that may hinder the expansion 
of the program, such as the acceptability of biofuels 
blend in said sectors/industries, the availability of fuel 
supply in the future, and the absence of standards for 
higher blends of biofuels.
Biodiesel 
� Need to create new domestic market and increase 
public awareness on the program especially among 
prospective CME manufactures, car manufacturers 
and associations, oil companies, government 
agencies and government financing institutions 
(GFIs), legislators, non-government organizations 
(NGOs), and transport group
feedstocks for bioethanol production
� Need for more investors to meet the mandated 
blend

C. ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND 
CONSERVATION PROGRAMS
The government’s National Energy Efficiency and 
Conservation Program (NEECP) launched by President 
Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in August 2004, was 
aimed to further strengthen the implementation of the 
energy efficiency and conservation programs through 
the promotion of judicious and efficient utilization of 
energy in the country. Its objective is to make energy 
conservation a way of life for every Filipino through the 
theme “EC Way of Life”. 
 
To effectively promote the NEECP, the DOE in 
partnership with the private sector has continuously 
pursued the aggressive implementation of existing 
energy conservation programs to rationalize energy 
demand consumption, particularly for petroleum 
products and electricity. The overall goal is to curb the 
impact of oil price volatility to the economy and reduce 
carbon dioxide emissions to protect the environment. 
Performance Assessment
The energy conservation efforts of the government 
generated energy savings of about 6.1 MMBFOE 
(0.88 MTOE) in 2006, with equivalent CO2 emission 
avoidance of 2.1 MMMT. This includes savings 
accounted from the energy management activities 
conducted by DOE such as the spot check program 
of government agencies nationwide per A.O. 126, 
Energy Indepenconsuming sectors. The campaign is in compliance 
with E.O. 123 “Institutionalizing the Committee on 
Power Conservation and Demand Management”
(Power Patrol) and E.O. 472 “Institutionalizing the 
Committee on Fuel conservation and Efficiency in Road 
Transport” (Road Transport Patrol). Among the activities 
conducted under the IEC campaign include seminarworkshop for target participants in the commercial, 
residential, industrial and government buildings; fuel 
economy run for road transport vehicles; and the use 
of television, radio and print media ads to reach wider 
target sectors. 
The first DOE-Flying V Biodiesel Fuel Economy 
Run was held on 09 December 2006 with a total of 
20 participants coming from national government 
agencies and various associations of mega taxis and 
passenger jeepneys. This is in line with the government’s 
program on the mandatory use of biofuels to reduce 
fuel consumption and toxic vehicular emissions in 
the country while simultaneously improving engine 
efficiency and combustion leading to increased 
mileage in vehicles.
About 25 seminar-workshops on energy 
conservation were held across the country in 2006 
until the first quarter of 2007 with audiences from 
the sectors in government, business and transport, as 
well as the academe, specifically elementary and high 
school students and teachers. 
Television ads under the theme “Kuryente” were 
aired over Channels 4, 9, 13 and 25 as well as radio 
ads titled “Gasolina” in 98 KBP member-radio stations 
to reach a wider consumer base in residential and 
transport sectors. 
Voluntary Agreements Program. Activities 
under this program include, among others, the 
promotion of the car-less day, carpooling and anti-idling 
campaigns. The aim is to promote fuel conservation 
and reduce pollution and traffic congestion in the 
country in partnership with various transport groups, 
local government units (LGUs), schools and shopping 
malls as well as with private individuals. A voluntary 
agreement is arranged between the DOE and the 
industrial establishments under the so called Partnership 
for Energy Responsive Companies/Ecozones. 
Energy Efficiency Standards and Labeling 
Program. As part of its continuing effort to promote 
the welfare of consumers, the DOE has been closely 
collaborating with various organizations including 
active alliance with DTI, Philippine Appliance Industry 
Energy Indepen
of locallymanufactured products, making them more 
competitive in the local market. Furthermore, as a result, 
it discourages the manufacturing and the importation of 
inefficient household appliances and lighting products 
sold in the market. 
The program, which started in 1993, consists of 
energy labeling for room air conditioners, refrigerators, 
compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and fluorescent lamp 
ballasts.
In 2006, the labeling program generated an 
estimated energy savings of 2.03 MMBFOE (0.29 
MTOE) which is over 100 percent increase from its 
2005 performance of 0.98 MMBFOE (0.14 MTOE). 
CFL labeling was the biggest contributor, generating 
an estimated savings of 1.13 MMBFOE (0.16 
MTOE). 
The DOE aims to expand the coverage of the 
program within the planning period to include linear 
fluorescent lamps, luminaries, household electric 
fans, industrial fans and blowers, television sets and 
electric motors. Consumer education shall also be 
undertaken as complementary activity for the effective 
implementation of the program. 
The Land Transportation Offi ce earned 98.0 percent in a spot check 
inspection conducted by the DOE Team headed by Assistant Secretary 
Matanog Mapandi. 
Government Energy Management 
Program (GEMP). The GEMP aims to integrate 
energy efficiency concepts into the operation of 
government agencies to realize the reduction target 
of ten percent in electricity and fuel consumption in 
compliance with the Presidential directive under A.O. 
126. The major activities under this program include 
the conduct of monitoring and energy audit spot 
check in all government buildings and the conduct of 
seminars on energy efficiency and conservation for 
government employees. Energy Indepen
savings of 36,752.3 MW of electricity, 287,296 liters 
of gasoline and 1,433,016 liters of diesel, translated 
to monetary savings of PhP 346.0 million.
Moreover, the DOE has conducted spot check 
inspections in 147 government agencies during the 
first quarter of 2007. 
Systems Loss Reduction Program. Under 
the umbrella of the Energy Management Program, the 
Systems Loss Reduction Program enables private utilities 
to decrease its systems losses through redesigning efforts 
made in transmission lines, improvement of substation 
equipment such as installation of capacitors and 
voltage regulators, and strict monitoring of electricity 
pilferers. This program reduced the systems loss from 
40.8 percent in 2005 to 40.4 percent in 2006. 
Recognition Programs. In recognition of the 
private sector’s effort to promote and implement energy 
conservation programs, the Don Emilio Abello Energy 
Efficiency Awards are handed out to private companies 
that make significant improvements in their energy 
consumption patterns. On the other hand, the Government 
Energy Management Program Award is given to 
government agencies that exceeded the mandatory 
10.0 percent reduction in energy consumption. 
At the regional level, the Don Emilio Abello Award 
giving body recognizes Philippine companies that are 
recipients of the ASEAN Best Practices Competition 
for Energy Efficiency and Conservation in Buildings. 
Likewise, the award giving body also recognizes 
companies who are recipient of the ASEAN Energy 
Management Award for Major Building and Industries. 
The ASEAN award bestows international recognition 
to qualified ASEAN countries that are exemplary in the 
field of energy efficiency and conservation and energy 
management system application.
In 2006, some 33 establishments received the 
Don Emilio Abello Energy Efficiency Awards with two 
companies, Bristol-Myers Squibb (Phils.), Inc. and Toshiba 
Information Equipment, Philippines being elevated to the 
Hall of Fame for consistently being outstanding leaders in 
energy conservation. The total energy savings realized 
by these companies was equivalent to 72.4 million liters 
of oil equivalent, which was significantly higher by 59.0 
percent from their energy savings of 29.6 million liters 
obtained in 2005. 
The Philippine-Makati 
Stock Exchange Building 
garnered the second 
passive ventilation and natural cooling features due to 
its structural design, as well as introduced retrofitting 
by upgrading the cooling equipment and implementing 
other energy-saving projects, which resulted in 941.3 
MW average savings per year. 
For the ASEAN Energy Management Award 
for Major Buildings and Industries, San Miguel Polo 
Brewery Plant and Republic Cement Corporation 
garnered the 1st and 2nd runner up recognitions 
during the awards night in 24 August 2007 held in 
Singapore. 
Energy Audit. This technical service is being 
offered by the DOE to manufacturing plants, commercial 
buildings and other energy-intensive companies to 
evaluate the energy utilization efficiencies of equipment, 
processes and operations of these companies, and 
recommend appropriate energy efficiency and 
conservation measures.
In 2006, the DOE has conducted energy audits in 
16 industrial and commercial companies nationwide. 
This activity is continuously being implemented in 
partnership with accredited energy service companies 
(ESCOs). To further enhance the energy management 
advisory services in the country, the Energy Service 
Company Association of the Philippines, Inc. or 
“ESCO Phil.” was organized in 2004. This association 
intends to, among others, (a) organize the firms 
engaged in the energy service industry to provide a 
forum for the effective exchange of information about 
industry practices and introduce new technologies 
for the industry; and, (b) promote energy efficiency 
and demand reduction technologies thereby creating 
tangible economic values. 
The energy audit services of the DOE seeks to determine the energy 
use patterns of companies and commercial establishments.
Philippine Efficient Lighting Market 
Transformation Project (PELMATP). Since the 
project’s inception in 2005, the UNDP-GEF funded aims to achieve an aggregate energy savings of 
29,000 GWh, equivalent to 2.0 percent reduction or 
translated to an equivalent GHG emission reduction of 
about 4,600 Gg of CO2.
There are five core strategies or components to 
achieve these objectives, namely: (1) EEL Policies, 
Standards and Guidelines Enhancement Program; (2) 
EEL Applications Institutional and Technical Capacity 
Development Program; (3) EEL Applications Consumer 
Awareness Improvement Program; (4) EEL Initiatives 
Financing Assistance Program; and (5) EEL Systems 
Waste Management Program. The project targets an 
11.0 percent GHG emission reduction by the end of 
the project in 2009.
Ground breaking ceremonies of the supply and construction of the 
building that will house the Goniophotometer test facility for light sources 
and luminaires led by former Undersecretaries Melinda Ocampo and 
Francisco Delfi n, Jr. was held on 25 July 2007. 
Measurable Sectoral Targets
In June 2006, the DOE together with PELMATP 
signed a MOA with Gawad Kalinga (GK), among the 
other entities, to promote EEL systems in the first 800 
households of the GK Village in Baseco Compound, 
Tondo, Manila. Gawad Kalinga (“to give care”), which 
started in 1995, is an organization that aims to provide 
land and build houses for the poor communities in the 
Philippines. Through the replacement of incandescent 
bulbs to more energy-efficient CFLs, it is estimated that 
these households could generate savings of about 
240,000 kWh of electricity per year, equivalent to 
about PhP 2.1 million in annual monetary savings.
For the energy labeling and efficiency standards 
program, the DOE will look into a minimum of 15 
percent increase in the average efficiency ratings of 
new appliance models within the planning period. 
This program is also expected to generate the biggest 
contribution of energy savings from 67 MMBFOE 
2010 up to 0.69 MMBFOE (0.10 MTOE) by the end 
of the planning period. 
Development Challenges
� IEC campaign in regional government offices, 
state colleges and universities for government 
energy management program will be focused 
on their compliance to A.O. 126, particularly 
on the submission of monthly fuel and electricity 
consumption report to DOE for monitoring and 
evaluation.
� Policy formulation through a D.C. that would 
require energy industry sectors to submit energy 
consumption report to DOE for monitoring 
purposes.
� Re-filing and re-activation of advocacy works for 
the deliberation of the Energy Conservation Bill 
which would institutionalize energy efficiency and 
conservation in the country. 
Action Plan

into law.
� Pursue the inclusion of standardized technical 
specification requirement in the procurement 
process of energy efficient lighting systems 
and other electrical equipment and devices in 
government offices e.g. the use of 36-watt instead 
of 40-watt CFLs and the use of energy-efficient LCD 
computer monitors. This shall be recommended 
to the Department of Budget and Management 
(DBM). 
� Develop a benchmark in the commercial and 
government buildings including the manufacturing 
industry sector. 
� To fill in the gap in the implementation of utilitybased demand side management (DSM), marketbased application under the Demand Reduction 
Program will instead be promoted. Meanwhile, 
existing policy framework for utility-driven 
DSM will be reviewed, as well as new set of 
recommendations will be submitted to concerned 
stakeholders for consultation to provide new policy 
directions.
� Evaluate the impact of IEC programs in the 
household sector through contracted survey services

need to be guided on the policy 
and program direction towards the 
full implementation of the reform 
program that aims to establish 
more effective, competitive and 
responsive electricity market.

previous year’s level of 15,619 
MW. In terms of capacity mix, fossilbased plants remain the dominant 
source with coal topping the list 
and contributing 26.4 percent 
share or 4,177 MW followed by 
oil with 22.7 percent (Table 13).
In terms of indigenous energy 
resources, hydroelectric power 
provided the highest share of 
20.6 percent while natural gas 
and geothermal plants contributed 
a total of 17.5 percent and 12.5 
percent, respectively. Wind and 
solar power on the other hand was 
able to contribute 0.2 percent in the 
mix. Table 13 shows the percentage 
utilization of each plant type.
Dependable Capacity. 
For 2006, the country’s total 
dependable capacity was 13,639 
MW or 86.0 percent of the 
15,803 MW total installed power 
under adverse conditions for a 
specified period of time and taking 
into consideration the plant’s 
wear and tear conditions. Windbased plants can only provide 
approximately 36.0 percent of 
its maximum output. In the case 
of hydroelectric power plants, its 
operational capability is highly 
dependent on the availability of 
water. Thus, dependable capacity 
is expectedly high during rainy 
season and low in dry months. 
Power Generation. In 
2006, the country’s self-sufficiency 
level went up to 66.0 percent from 
the 2005 level of 65.0 percent. 
Meanwhile, gross electricity 
generation in 2006 was recorded 
at 56,784 GWh, an increase 
of 0.4 percent from the previous 
year’s level.

Natural gas, which has replaced coal as the 
country’s dominant fuel since 2005, produced 16,366 
GWh or 29.0 percent of the total electricity generated. 
However, this was lower by 2.9 percent from its 2005 
level due to the 25-day maintenance schedule of the 
Malampaya Gas-to-Power project on 22 November to 
14 December 2006. This resulted in the interruption 
of natural gas supply to the Ilijan, Sta Rita and San 
Lorenzo power plants. To meet the existing demand 
during said period, oil-based power plants (Malaya, 
Bauang Diesel, Subic and Limay) and hydropower 
(Binga and Pantabangan) were operated during peak 
hours. A block of Ilijan power plants using liquid fuel 
oil (LFO) was likewise put on standby reserve. 
Electricity generation from coal-based plants was 
recorded at 15,294 GWh posting a 27.0 percent 
share in the mix and an increase of 0.2 percent from 
the previous year’s level. The increase was due to 
the commercial operation of the 210-MW Mindanao 
coal during the 3rd quarter of 2006. The plant also 
contributed about 13.0 percent to the generation mix 
of Mindanao resulting to a decrease in its utilization 
levels of oil-based plants. In Luzon, electricity generation 
from coal-based plants decreased by 3.8 percent due 
to maintenance outages of Sual Units 1 and 2.
provided a total of 9,938 GWh or 17.5 percent of the 
total. Meanwhile, electricity generation from oil-based 
power plants hit a low of 24.1 percent or 4,664 GWh 
from the 2005 level. The decline is due to the ongoing 
program of NPC to limit the utilization of oil-based 
plants in the light of the soaring prices of oil in the 
world market. 
Meanwhile, the share of renewable energy like 
wind and solar in the generation mix was only 0.1 
percent or 55 GWh. 
In terms of ownership, electricity generation from 
NPC-owned power plants and NPC-Independent Power 
Producers (IPPs) totaled 40,472 GWh, an increase of 
1.1 percent from previous year’s level sharing 71.3 
percent of the total electricity generation. The rest 
come from Manila Electric Company (Meralco)-IPP, 
Electric Cooperatives (ECs) and other IPPs.
For 2007 level, the country’s electricity generation 
for the first half was recorded at 29, 214 GWh, 21,468 
GWh in Luzon, 3,880 GWh in Visayas and 3,866 
GWh in Mindanao. In terms of additional capacity, 
Northern Negros Geothermal with a rated capacity of 
49 MW became operational in February 2007.
Actual vs. Forecast. In comparing the actual 
and forecast data for 2006, the actual generation 
was slightly lower than the forecasted data. This may 
be due to the dispatch decisions that were made to 
address unscheduled plant shutdown or operational 
problems. Significant discrepancy was noted in the 
Visayas with 23.4 percent difference. This is the result 
of the generation planning tool used in forecasting. 
The tool only reflects existing demand in the Visayas 
grid without considering demand for export to Luzon. 
Electricity Sales. The country’s total electricity 
sales slightly grew by 1.1 percent from 47,163 GWh 
level in 2005 to 47,678 GWh level in 2006. In terms 
of comparison between the actual and forecasted data, 
the 2006 actual electricity sales was 13.3 percent lower 
than the projections. This may be attributed to typhoons 
Reming, Milenyo and Lucas that hit the Southern Luzon 
areas during the last months of 2006 causing severe 
damages in infrastructures and resulting in inevitable 
power outages.

the other hand, the proliferation in the number of 
commercial establishments and small-scale industries 
indicating increased economic activities yielded 
substantial increase of 3.5 percent for commercial and 
1.2 percent for the industrial sectors. Meanwhile, public 
buildings, street lights and other sector not included in 
the three major sectors rose by 8.3 percent to 1,275

17,848 GWh in Luzon, 2,672 GWh in Visayas and 
2,899 GWh in Mindanao.
Peak Demand. The country’s highest demand 
was recorded at 8,760 MW, 1.5 percent higher than 
the 2005 level of 8,629 MW (Table 17). On a per 
grid basis, peak in Luzon, which occurred during the 
month of May was 0.4 percent higher than its 2005 
level. Peak in Visayas and Mindanao, on the other 
hand, was up by 2.8 percent with 1,066 MW and 6.9 
percent at 1,228 MW, respectively. The surge in these 
two grids, which occurred in the month of December, 
was due to increased economic and social activities 
brought about by festivities during Christmas season.

In terms of comparison between the actual and 
forecast data, actual peak demand for 2006 was 
4.5 percent short of the forecast data. Much of the 
discrepancy was in Visayas grid where actual peak 
demand was 7.6 percent lower than its forecasted 
value. Luzon grid, being the largest among the three 
main islands, registered the lowest but still significant 
discrepancy of 3.9 percent. 
2003 and 2004 when the economy decelerated in 
2004 due to adverse internal and external factors such 
as rising global oil and commodity prices, weak fiscal 
position and uncertainty on the outcome of the May 
2004 elections.16
For the first half of 2007, the country’s peak 
demand stood at 8,842 MW, broken down into: 6,619 
MW in Luzon, 1,078 MW in Visayas and 1,145 MW 
in Mindanao.

Systems Loss. Due to the government’s continuing 
program to increase systems reliability and efficiency, 
the percentage share of losses in the total electricity 
cycle decreased by 2.6 percent from 11,408 GWh 
level in 2005 to 11,112 GWh level in 2006. Almost 
60.0 percent of these figures or 6,885 GWh came from 
aggregate distribution losses which were heightened 
by damages in distribution lines due to the typhoons 
that hit some parts of the country during the year. The 
remaining 40.0 percent comprised the utilities own-use 
power for office and housing.

Performance Assessment
Several transmission projects were completed in 
2006 to include the San Roque Associated Transmission 
Line and Substation Project and Panay-Boracay 69 kV 
Interconnection Project. The San Roque Project which 
will transport power from San Roque Hydro Power Plant 
to San Manuel Substation involves the construction of 
approximately 10 kms, 230 kV, 2 x 795 MCM ACSR 
steel tower, double circuit transmission line. The PanayBoracay project, on the other hand, is an additional 
submarine cable with higher capacity to link Boracay 
to Panay Island. This project is Phase 1 of the Small 
Island Submarine Interconnection Development (SISID) 
Project. It is also considered the initial groundwork of the 
Boracay-Tablas-Romblon-Interconnection Project, another 
phase of the SISID Program. In addition, the Batangas 
S/S (Upgrade) component of the Batangas Transmission 
Reinforcement Project was also completed in May 2006.
Measurable Sectoral Targets
Several projects, as shown in Table 21, are linedup for implementation to boost the system’s efficiency 
and reliability. 
B. EPIRA DEVELOPMENTS
in terms of the objectives set out in the law. The 
privatization process of the NPC assets has gained 
momentum. The DOE and its attached agencies were 
able to complete major reforms from the separation of 
the generation, transmission, distribution and supply 
functions to the establishment of the WESM.
To date, the remaining task that will redound to full 
benefits of the EPIRA is the implementation of Open 
Access and Retail Competition, which is still subject to 
the privatization condition under Section 31 of the Act.
PRIVATIZATION OF NPC ASSETS
Privatization of Generation Assets 
As of July 2007, the government has successfully 
bid out and turned over eight hydroelectric plants to 
private owners and one large coal power plant for a 
total of nine generating plants. Six of the plants sold 
were in Luzon and Visayas with a combined capacity 
of 1,075.4 MW, which put the privatization level at 
24.8 percent. 
Meanwhile, the government is determined to 
further raise the level of privatization and immediately 
implement open access and retail competition. The Power Sector R
Binga Hydro Power Plants in November.17 Other 
power plants are also scheduled for bidding, namely: 
Manila Thermal Plant, the Palinpinon Geothermal Plant 
in Negros and the Panay Diesel Plant in Dingle, Iloilo. 
Table 22 shows the privatized NPC power plants. 
Privatization of Transmission Assets
After two unsuccessful bids in 2003, PSALM issued 
a public notice for the third round of bid for the TransCo 
business on 28 May 2006. The government declared 
the bidding for the TransCo 25-year concession a 
failure after only one investor group submitted a bid.
The government carefully studied the concerns 
raised by investors and considered these in the 
review of the privatization structure. In June 2007, the 
government, through the PSALM Board, approved the 
structure and bidding package of TransCo. 
To promote greater investors’ interest in TransCo, 
the government embarked on a series of international 
road shows in July participated in by officials of PSALM, 
DOE, DOF, ERC and TransCo. 
The Invitation to Bid for TransCo was published 
on 23-25 July 2007 in major newspapers, in time for 
the fourth round of bidding targeted on 12 December 
2007. In August 2007, 21 parties had shown interest 
to bid for the transmission business.18

17 Calaca and Ambuklao-Binga power plants were bid out on 16 October 
contracted energy output of NPC/PSALM IPP contracts. 
The IPPA process is part of a broader plan to privatize 
both the generation and transmission assets, and to 
bring competition into the supply market through an 
“Open Access” mechanism.
Since the WESM commenced its operation in 
June 2006, PSALM has effectively been acting as the 
interim IPPA by bidding out the NPC/PSALM IPPs’ 
energy output in the spot market on a day-to-day basis. 
PSALM initially split the IPPs into four trading teams to 
manage them, but were subsequently reduced to three 
teams. Although the total megawatt capacity of the 
portfolios of said trading teams has increased, it is still 
below the 30.0 percent threshold capacity of the Luzon 
grid as stipulated in the EPIRA. 
The World Bank grant, through the Policy on 
Human Resources and Development (PHRD), has 
enabled the DOE to facilitate the Technical Assistance 
(TA) on the Appointment of IPPAs and Energy Trading 
for both NPC and PSALM. 
The objective of the TA is to advise the IPPATechnical Working Group (IPPA-TWG) on the structure, 
contract terms and the process on the appointment of 
IPPAs. The IPPA-TWG was created by the DOE with 
NPC and PSALM as members. 
The IPPA Advisor has commenced work for the 
IPPA in April 2007. Its task is to review the following 
proposed approaches for the administration and 
management of the contracted energy by the IPPA:
 
 Agency Approach 
 This specifies that payment and financial risks 
remain with the NPC/ PSALM while NPC 
remains the contract party.
 Ownership Approach 
This purports to create integrated supply Power Sector Re
Universal Charge (UC)
Pursuant to Section 34 of the 
EPIRA, PSALM administers the fund 
collections from the UC, which 
should be disbursed in an open 
and transparent manner and for the 
purposes specified in the law. The 
UC is a non-by-passable charge 
collected from all end-users every 
month by the distribution utilities, 
TransCo, and supplier based on the 
approval made by the ERC. 
Total collections/remittances 
as of September 2007 amounted 
to PhP 7.43 billion, out of which 
PSALM disbursed PhP 7.15 billion 
from the Special Trust Fund (STF) for 
the environmental charges of NPC 
and for the missionary electrification 
of NPC-Strategic Power Utilities 
Group (SPUG) in accordance with 
the provisions of EPIRA. Table 23 
shows the UC remittances and 
disbursements. 
Removal of crosssubsidies. To date, all 120 ECs 
have already implemented crosssubsidy removal in electricity 
pricing in various phases: 50.0 
percent-60.0 percent removal, 
40.0 percent-60.0 percent 
removal, complete removal, 2/3 
removal, 1/3 removal and 1/4 
removal. There are 51 ECs that 
have completely removed interclass cross subsidy, while the 
remaining 69 ECs are still in 
various phases of cross-subsidy 
removal schemes. 
Provision of Lifeline 
Rates. As a socialized pricing 
mechanism, lifeline rate is given 
to low-income captive electricity 
end-users. The rate is largely based 
on the consumer profile of EC 
coverage area and the efficiency 
of operations of the concerned 
distribution utilities (DUs). ERC has 
approved the lifeline rates for 127 
of the 139 DUs in March 2007.

WESM
Implementation of WESM 
in Luzon
WESM’s first year of operation 
in Luzon went through smoothly 
albeit some market flaws, which 
revealed what needs to be done 
in order to achieve the very 
purpose of its establishment, i.e. 
promote competition, improve the 
performance of the electricity spot 
market, particularly on the aspect 
of fair competition and prevent any 
market power exercise. 
Those customers that have not 
yet registered in the WESM are 
supplied either through bilateral 
power supply contracts with 
generators, or through the default 
wholesale supply arrangement with 
NPC and PSALM.
Highlights of Luzon 
Commercial Operations
Highest peak demand was 
registered in May 2007 at 6,590 
MW while average demand was 
at the lowest in November 2006 
at 3,242 MW. As for the energy 
offered by participating generators to 
WESM, average energy offers were 
at their lowest in January and March 
2007. Tight supply condition during 
these months was due to outages of 
generating plants, unavailability of 
certain generating plants because 
of fuel constraints, line limitations 
and declining offers from hydroelectric plants caused by low water 
levels. With tight supply margin, 
actual manual load dropping was 
experienced in April 2007. 
Effective Settlement Prices in 
the WESM were relatively high 
from April to June 2007 as high 
levels of demand coupled with 
thin supply margins were likewise 
experienced. In addition, the 
dispatch of more expensive diesel 
and oil generating plants increased Power Sector R
(Table 26). 
Power supply in Luzon is mostly 
covered by bilateral power supply 
contracts quantities (the “BCQ”), 
with spot market purchases 
accounting for only about 15.0 to 
20.0 percent of the total energy 
consumption. 
Visayas Trial Operations 
Program
The Philippine Electricity Market 
Corp. (PEMC) plans to integrate the 
WESM in Luzon with its Visayas 
counterpart within the first half of 
2007. As of November 2007, 
PEMC had registered a total of 
37 trading participants. Of these, 
14 are generators, while 23 are 
customers classified into distribution 
utilities, rural electric cooperatives, 
and industrial and commercial 
customers.
Since March 2006, PEMC 
has been conducting a series of 
Trial Operation Program (TOP) 
among the trading participants in 
the Visayas. This is a series of highlevel Market Operations Scenario 
Tests (MOST) that are performed in 
different phases and are intended to 
fully test the functionality of Market 
Management System (MMS) in 
the region. TOP aims to assess 
the capabilities and readiness 
of power industry stakeholders 
in terms of the electricity market 
rules, procedures and processes 
through their participation in 
a “live” environment prior to 
the commencement of WESM 
commercial operations in the 
Visayas region. 
The integration of Visayas 
market has been envisioned to help 
find a solution to an impending 
power supply problem in the region. 
It is anticipated that investors would 
come in to build new power plants 
and add new capacity to the 
of offers, processing of offers, 
demand forecasting, system status 
reporting, dispatch implementation 
and dispatch reporting.
ERC Regulatory Filings
Approval of the Pricing 
and Cost Recovery Mechanism 
for Reserves in the Philippine 
Wholesale Electricity Spot Market. 
PEMC has already filed its 
PCRM provides details of the 
formulation and procedures by 
which reserve dispatch schedules 
and zonal reserve prices for each 
reserve region are calculated in 
the Market Dispatch Optimization 
Model and which are already 
set forth in the approved WESM 
Price Determination Methodology 
(PDM). On 24 May 2007, PEMC 
submitted its “Formal Offer of 
Evidence” for such pricing and cost

PEMC Governance. The 
WESM rules provide for the creation 
of five WESM Committees as shown 
in Table 29.
Aside from said committees, 
the Market Assessment Group 
(MAG) and the Enforcement and 
Compliance Offices (ECO) of 
PEMC were likewise established to 
be directly involved in the WESM 
governance. MAG, together with 
ECO and MSC, undertakes the 
monitoring and assessment of 
market outcomes and behaviors 
pursuant to the WESM Rules and the 
Market Surveillance, Enforcement 
and Compliance Market Manual. 
Way Forward 
The DOE is working on the 
most facilitative institutional 
arrangement among the energy 
sector agencies to address 
the multi-challenges facing the 
implementation of the EPIRA. The 
ultimate objective is to harmonize 
efforts for a better electricity 
market that would effectively 
cater to various demand sectors, 
and at the same time achieve the 
overall national development goal 
of globally competitive power 
industry/market.
C. EXPANDED RURAL 
ELECTRIFICATION
Over the past two decades, 
rural electrification has always 
been one of the government’s 
priority thrusts. As one of the 
Ten-Point Legacy Agenda of the 
Arroyo administration, the DOE 
has instituted the Expanded Rural 
Electrification (ER) Program to Luzon

Performance Assessment
The country’s total electrification level as of 31 July 
2007 stood at 95.5 percent having electrified 40,086 
out of the total 41,980 barangays.20 This leaves a total 
of 1,894 barangays still to be energized until 2008.
Among the country’s major islands, Luzon has 
the highest electrification level at 97.3 percent. The 
remaining 555 unelectrified barangays are mostly 
found in Regions II, IV-B and V. 
The island of Visayas achieved 97.0 percent 
electrification level from 96.8 percent in 2006. The 338 
remaining unelectrified barangays are mostly found in 
Region VIII, particularly in the province of Samar. 
Meanwhile, the electrification level in Mindanao 
increased to 90.0 percent from 89.0 percent in 2006. 
The 1,001 remaining unelectrified barangays are 
located in Regions IX, X and ARMM. 
Table 31 highlights the electrification level of the 
different regions in the country. NCR has achieved 
100 percent electrification level while ARMM has only 
76.0 percent electrification level, the lowest among the 
regions. Other regions with low electrification levels 
include IV-B, V, VIII, IX and XII. 
In terms of franchise area, the ECs were able to 
energize an accumulated 95.0 percent of its coverage 
areas with a remaining balance of 1,795 barangays. 
On the other hand, Meralco which is the country’s largest 
distribution utility, is only short of 63 barangays to energize 
within its franchise areas registering an accumulated total 
of 98.5 percent as of end of 31 July 2007. Meanwhile, the 
private-investor owned utilities as well as local government 
units have 36 remaining barangays to be energized. 
On the other hand, around 3,200.46 ckt.-kms of 
distribution lines and 10 MVA of substation capacities 
were installed in 2006. A total of 550.67 ckt.-kms of 
distribution lines were also rehabilitated and upgraded 
to enhance the delivery of electricity particularly in 
remote areas nationwide.
ER Program. The reconstituted ER Program is an 
integration of efforts of both government and the private 
sector on rural electrification. The Program also aims 
to develop innovative and sustainable policies and 
strategies on rural electrification consistent with the EPIRA 
provisions. From the public sector, the implementers

grid electrification to make electricity accessible to 
more communities. Government subsidy is also being 
offered especially on the use of renewable energybased facility to electrify communities in remote areas. 
Further, to augment the ER Program, the DOE is 
currently pursuing the energization of the 211 priority 
barangays of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.
Meanwhile, the NEA has been mandated to 
extend technical, financial and institutional assistance 
to the ECs to improve the delivery of electricity in 
their respective franchise areas. The PNOC-EDC, on 
the other hand, has been offering advanced financial 
assistance for electrification in areas where their 
geothermal fields are located such as in Negros Island 
and the Bicol Region. 
 Private Sector Initiative. The IPPs are also 
committed to assist the DOE in its electrification 
program. The IPPs support the program through the 
provision of advance financing for electrification 
projects and the “Adopt-a-Barangay” scheme. Mirant 
and KEPCO both committed to energize a number of 
barangays throughout the country. To date, Mirant 
has 184 remaining barangays to be electrified in 
2007, from the total commitment of 1,500 barangays 
since 2000. On the other hand, KEPCO has a total 
commitment of 500 barangays to be energized. Of 
the total, 200 barangays will be energized in 2007, of 
which not less than 40 sitios or 20 barangays in Cebu 
have been energized. 
The participation of Qualified Third Party (QTP) in 
the electrification program is stipulated in the EPIRA 
under Section 59 and Rule 14 of its IRR, which requires 
the QTP to engage in providing electricity service 
to unviable and remote areas that are not covered 
and reached by franchise utilities. To complement 
the D.C.s – D.C. 2004-06-006 and D.C. 2005-012-
011 – which prescribe the qualification criteria and 
guidelines for QTP participation issued by DOE, the 
ERC through its Resolution No. 22, Series of 2006, 
has set the rules for the regulation of QTPs performing 
missionary electrification in areas declared unviable 
by DOE. To date, the two pilot QTPs involved in 
the rural electrification program are PowerSource 
Philippines in Palawan and Paris-Manila Technology 
Corporation, Inc. (PAMATEC) in Masbate. The DOE 
is also assisting both firms in filing its application as 
QTP to ERC.
The Philippine Rural Electrification Service (PRES) 
Project, which commenced in January 2007, is directed 
of the project include: lighting for barangay halls and 
school buildings, provision of vaccine refrigerators, 
lighting for rural health units, and provision of streetlights 
to major thoroughfares. Marketing activities to identify 
the potential 18,000 households was done in the first 
half of 2007. Ongoing activities are the survey on the 
socio-economic profile of households and the staking of 
the barangays for the mini-grid system.
The Sustainable Solar Market Package (SSMP) 
under the Rural Power Project (RPP) was designed to 
solicit private sector participation in the government’s 
electrification program. It is also being used in Project 
ACCESS or Accelerating Community Energy Systems 
Using Solar, a new component of RPP. The SSMP, 
which clusters barangays into viable packages, is an 
ingenious approach towards addressing the availability 
of electricity in remote rural areas. Under the SSMP, PV 
systems will be supplied and installed in key public 
facilities and commercially marketed to a limited number 
of households within a given period (e.g. 30 systems 
or 25.0 percent of barangay households, whichever is 
larger within 12 months). To ensure the installation of 
PV systems in public facilities, funds would be made 
available through DOE and NPC-SPUG, as well as 
from the IPPs and donor agencies. 
Currently, the SSMP is being pursued in 76 
barangays in Aklan, Masbate, Northern Samar, 
Palawan, Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga del Sur 
and Iligan City. To date, the installation of solar PV 
systems in 21 barangays in Zamboanga del Norte and 
Zamboanga del Sur and two barangays in Iligan City 
have been completed. The SSMP Operator is expected 
to complete the marketing activities for household sales 
by June 2008 in subject barangays. Also, the DOE – in 
partnership with the private sector – has undertaken 
preparatory activities for the scale up of SSMP projects, 
which is expected to energize around 500 barangays 
nationwide.
Power Sector Re
Ceremonial switch-on of Masbate PRES Project held on 03 May 
2007 in Malacañang Palace. Present in the photo are (R to L): DOE enables the private sector to take over the supply of 
electricity to any existing NPC-SPUG area, either 
through outright purchase or lease of existing NPCSPUG assets, and/or installation of new power 
generating facilities including associated power 
delivery systems. At present, there are 74 NPC-SPUG 
areas in the country. Of the 74 NPC-SPUG areas, 
14 were offered to the private sector under the NPP 
Program. Eight out of the 14 offered areas were already 
awarded with their respective NPPs. These areas are 
in Mindoro, Marinduque, Palawan, Catanduanes, 
Masbate, Tablas, Romblon and Bantayan.
Foreign-Assisted Projects. The RPP is a 14-
year project financed by the World Bank-Global 
Environment Facility (WB-GEF). The project, which 
has four phases, aims to increase access to electricity 
services and transform ECs into more viable and 
competitive commercial entities. The first phase of 
the project, which commenced in June 2004 to end 
in 2009 will have additional target of 10,000 new 
household connections. The DOE has accredited eight 
PV companies and a MOA has been executed with the 
said companies. Establishment of tie-ups with microfinance institutions (MFIs) and rural banks has also been 
carried out. Technical assistance is also being offered to 
support the private companies and MFIs. 
The Solar Power Technology Support (SPOTS) 
Project, which supports agrarian reform communities 
(ARCs), is a joint undertaking of DAR and DOE that 
started in 2003. It is a three year project funded by 
the Spanish government. The project introduced PV 
applications for agricultural and rural enterprises 
expecting to address poverty in unenergized and offgrid ARCs. The project is now on its second phase 
targeting 44 ARCs situated in far-flung unenergized 
barangays in Mindanao.
The Alliance for Mindanao Off-Grid Renewable 
Energy (AMORE) Program - a joint undertaking 
of USAID, Mirant Philippines, ARMM, Winrock 
International and DOE - intends to energize conflictaffected and off-grid areas in Mindanao. To date, the 
project has energized 227 barangays using renewable 
energy systems. These are located in Sulu, Basilan, 
Tawi-Tawi, Maguindanao, Zamboanga Sibugay, 
Zamboanga del Sur, Sultan Kudarat, Davao City, and 
Zamboanga City. AMORE is completing the solar 
energy electrification in 148 conflict-affected areas 
in ARMM. Other activities/initiatives were likewise 
undertaken for the energized barangays under the 
said project, as follows: 
Power Sector R
energy systems; 
 Distance and computer-aided education were 
made available to beneficiaries through 
partnership with other private companies; and 
 Conducted organization and capacitybuilding training for members of the 
“Barangay Renewable Energy and Community 
Development Associations” (BRECDAs) to 
operate and maintain the systems, as well as 
sustain the socio-economic benefits extended 
to the community by the project.
Measurable Sectoral Targets
The DOE, together with its attached agencies 
and private institutions is committed to energize 892 
barangays in 2007 and 1,162 barangays in 2008 
to attain the 100 percent total barangay electrification 
(Table 33).

For the energy sector to achieve total barangay 
electrification in 2008, it would require setting up 
of renewable energy systems in off-grid areas and 
expanding 4,548 ckt.-kms. of distribution lines 
until 2008. Likewise, an additional 2,173 MVA of 
substation capacities are also needed in grid areas. 
Around 8,779 ckt.-kms. of distribution lines will be 
rehabilitated in order to deliver a reliable and efficient 
supply of electricity until the targeted year (Table 34).
As a way forward, the government’s rural 
electrification program not only envisions total 
barangay electrification by 2008 but also intends 
to realize 90.0 percent household connections by 
2017. Attaining the targeted 90.0 percent household 
connection would necessitate the expansion of 4,716

Development Challenges
� Encouraging more private sector participation in 
rural electrification, particularly in those areas/
barangays not covered by EC’s electrification 
program. 
 
� Cost of acquiring information and data on the 
geographic location of remaining unelectrified 
barangays. Such information will aid in determining 
appropriate electrification solutions to the target 
barangays. 
� Exploring innovative strategies to deliver electricity 
services in the remote areas, in particular, areas 
that are untenable due to peace and order 
situation, inaccessibility, and low population 
density. 
Action Plan
� Strengthen and establish more partnerships with 
other potential partners such as NGOs and private 
institutions to fast-track electrification activities in 
highly remote barangays. 
 
� Address the issues on disbursements, funds 
availability and any legal impediments to 
a partnership or joint undertaking for rural 
electrification projects/programs. 
� Formulate a special implementation strategy and 
subsidy scheme for the remaining unelectrified 
barangays in Mindanao. Such could be 
implemented through the inclusion of “social 
preparation fund” in the total project cost, as well 
as creating partnerships or linkages between and 
SSMP is being considered by the private sector 
as another approach to energize inaccessible 
barangays.
D. BENEFITS TO HOST 
COMMUNITIES 
The DOE has continuously extended benefits to 
communities hosting energy generating projects through 
E.R. 1-94 as provided in Section 5 (i) of R.A. 7638 
or the Department of Energy Act of 1992. Under E.R. 
1-94, host communities are entitled to both financial 
and non-financial benefits from energy generating 
companies to support their community development 
and livelihood programs, among others.

Host communities can draw funds from E.R. 1-94 
upon submission of proposed projects in any of the 
following: electrification fund (EF), development and 
livelihood fund (DLF), and reforestation, watershed 
management, health, and/or environment enhancement 
fund (RWMHEEF). 
Aside from financial benefits, the non-monetary 
entitlements include preference for employment, training 
and skills development, priority in load dispatch, 
procurement of local supplies, and environmental 
management.
Performance Assessment
As of December 2006, the DOE approved a total 
of 454 projects equivalent to PhP 534.92 million. 
From these projects, there were 297 financed under 
EF amounting to PhP 229.67 million. The EF projects 
benefited a total of 111 barangays, 239 sitios, and 
60 enhancement projects particularly in the provinces 
of Quezon, Laguna, Rizal, Northern Samar, Bukidnon, 
Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur. On the other 
hand, around 80 projects were approved under DLF 
and 77 projects for RWMHEEF with total project funds 
amounting to PhP 175.70 million and PhP129.55 About 196 projects equivalent to PhP 253.81 
million were approved under E.R. 1-94 as of 31 July 
2007. Of the 196 projects, 99 were electrification 
projects amounting to PhP 118.23 million. Around 
97 barangays and 81 sitios from the provinces 
of Batangas, Cavite, Davao City, Laguna, North 
Cotabato, Pangasinan, Romblon, Quezon, and 
Zambales benefited from EF. Forty-one projects 
were approved for DLF amounting to PhP 46.62 
million while RWMHEEF had 56 approved projects 
amounting to PhP 88.96 million.
To ensure effective and timely implementation 
of projects, the DOE instituted project management 
measures such as the opening of trust funds for 
financial benefits accruing to host communities from 
the commercial operations of the various power plants 
nationwide. Initially, a total of 24 trust funds (EF, DLF, 
and RWMHEEF) covering eight power plants were 
opened in 2006. 
Moreover, 44 completed projects were physically 
inspected and assessed in 2006. Twenty of these 
projects are under DLF while the remaining 24 are 
under RWMHEEF. The DOE also conducted various 
IECs/consultations/briefings to host communities, 
including the new stakeholders/players under the E.R. 
1-94 program.
Development Challenges
The effective implementation of E.R. 1-94 program 
is still constrained by the need to strengthen capacities 
of LGUs, particularly in the areas of project development 
planning, monitoring and evaluation. They also need 
to be equipped with skills on social preparedness and 
community organization. Meanwhile, frequent turnover 
in LGU leadership could also be mitigated with the 
continuing conduct of information dissemination on the 
merits of the program and adherence to its guidelines 
and procedures. 
Action Plan
Similarly, the action plans adopted in the reference 
plan are likewise considered in this Plan Update, as 
follows: 
� Complete inventory of all generation facilities in 
the country to ensure that benefits under E.R. 1-94 
are extended to the host communities. 
� Facilitate the establishment of the required trust 
funds through the execution of agreements between 
� Conduct regular public consultations, IEC 
campaigns and workshops with concerned 
stakeholders for the review of the amended E.R. 
1-94 procedures and project implementation.
� Facilitate evaluation of LGU project proposals and 
releases of funds for project implementation. 
� Conduct of seminar/workshop to enhance LGUs 
capability in the preparation of project proposals, 
project implementation and monitoring in 
collaboration with the power plant proponents/
owners. 
� Review Rule 29 (A)21 of the EPIRA-IRR and institute 
corresponding amendments to make the program 
more responsive. 
Power Sector RV. Downstream Energy 
Industry
A. OIL INDUSTRY DEREGULATION
R.A. 8479 or the Downstream Oil Industry 
Deregulation Act of 1998 provides that the government 
liberalize and deregulate its downstream oil industry to 
ensure a truly competitive market under a regime of fair 
prices, level playing field, adequate and continuous 
supply of environmentally-clean and high-quality 
petroleum products. To this end, the government shall 
promote and encourage the entry of new participants 
in the downstream oil industry and introduce adequate 
measures to ensure the attainment of these goals. This is 
also within the Arroyo Administration’s goal of leaving 
a legacy of successful government plans and programs 
to win the war against poverty. 
On the other hand, the DOE continually carries out 
close monitoring of oil industry activities, as well as the 
compliance of industry players to quality standards.
Performance Assessment
Eight years after the implementation of R.A. 8479, 
a total of 627 players (1st half of 2007) are engaged in 
various activities in the oil industry such as marketing, 
distribution and storage of petroleum products. Total 
accumulated investment reached PhP 30.74 billion 
as of end 2006. Such investment has increased to 
PhP 31.69 billion in the first half of 2007. Improved 
investment is seen to provide additional jobs and 
greater accessibility to quality petroleum products. 
Supply
Inventory. In 2006, actual industry inventory 
inclusive of stocks in-transit from the import sources 
averaged at a 59-day supply equivalent. This was 
eight percent lower than the 64-day average supply 
stocks by the oil companies equivalent to 15 days for 
refiners and seven days for both bulk suppliers and 
LPG players. 
Importation. For 2006, crude import volume 
increased by only 0.5 percent vis-à-vis 2005 figure 
due to high levels of stocks and not much improvement 
in the country’s oil requirements. On the other hand, 
importation of finished petroleum products is almost 
at the same level with 2005. Forty-one percent of the 
country’s demand is imported as finished product. 
Refinery Production. Total crude oil processed 
by local refiners in 2006 was 2.6 percent lower 
compared to the previous year’s level. This may be 
attributed to the maintenance shutdown of several 
process units of refinery sometime within that year. 
Likewise, other process units were also closed due 
to power outages brought about by several typhoons 
that hit the country resulting in a decline of 1.8 percent 
in the local refinery capacity utilization.
Further, 2006 local refinery production output 
slightly fell by 0.6 percent compared with the previous 
year.

the decrease in their over-all market share from 15.2 
Million Barrels (MMB) in 2005 to 13.6 MMB as of 
2006. Similarly, their market share to total demand in 
the LPG sector also dropped from 44.5 percent in 2005 
to 40.7 percent in 2006. This is due to the temporary 
shut down of operation of Nation Corporation, one of 
the LPG independent players, during the last quarter 
of 2006. 
In 2006, the industry recorded a total of 3,472 
gasoline stations. This represents an additional 103 
stations, which is equivalent to 3.0 percent increase 
from previous year’s 3,369. Among the Philippines’ 
three main island grids, Luzon has the most number of 
gasoline stations constructed by the new players. Table

The DOE ensures the reasonableness of domestic 
benchmarks and the foreign exchange. The DOE-DOJ 
Task Force is convened as necessary to determine and 
rule on reports of suspicions on unreasonable rise in the 
domestic prices. 
In May 2006, as crude oil and petroleum products 
reached new record highs, E.O. No. 527 “Temporarily 
Modifying the Rates of Import Duty on Crude Petroleum 
Oils and Refined Petroleum Products Under Section 
104 of the Tariff and Custom Code of 1978 as 
Amended” was issued to serve as a safety net against 
the volatility of the international market price of oil. The 
said E.O. provided for an automatic tariff cut based 
on international trigger price levels as agreed upon by 
the DOE, DOF/BOC and NEDA. On the basis of this 
E.O. likewise, the oil companies had reflected tarrif 
reduction for crude and finished petroleum products in 
the pump prices of diesel fuel sold to the public from 
June to November 2006.
With the country’s strong currency, coupled 
with persuasion against one-time price changes, oil 
companies effected small incremental price adjustments. 
Further reductions were offered in 605 gasoline stations 
nationwide giving price discounts on diesel for public 
transport. In Metro Manila alone, there were 253 
stations offering diesel price discount, while there were 
278 stations in Luzon, 33 in the Visayas, and 41 in 
Mindanao. 
Standards Formulation and Enforcement
Petroleum Products, Biofuels and Other 
Fuel Related Products. The DOE, through the 
Technical Committee on Petroleum Products and 
Additives (TCPPA), continues its standards-setting 
activities guided further by international/regional 
standards and trends on fuel and fuel-related products. 
The TCCPA was created pursuant to R.A. 8749 or the 
Clean Air Act (CAA) of 1999 to set quality standard for 
petroleum and other fuel-related products as mandated 
under the CAA, as well as for alternative fuels. Similarly, 
the Department spearheaded the development and 
formulation of quality specifications for alternative 
fuels from indigenous and renewable energy sources 
consistent with the country’s energy independence 
agenda and sustainable development.
Downstream Energy InConventional Fuels and other FuelRelated Products:
� PNS/DOE QS 001:2005 – Unleaded 
Motor Gasoline Specifications. This standard 
replaced PNS 1131:2002 (DOE 001:2002) 
which highlighted quality improvements such 
as the reduction of maximum sulfur content 
from 0.1percent for premium and 0.2 percent 
for regular grade to 0.005 percent mass for all 
grades in conformance with the sulfur limit of Euro 
II standard.
� PNS/DOE QS 006: 2005 – Fuel Oils (Bunker) 
Specifications. This standard updated/reviewed 
PNS 21:1997 with no major revision made except 
on the test methods. Said standard retained the 
three grades based on sulfur content: BFO1, BFO2 
and BFO 3.
� PNS/DOE QS 005:2005 – Liquefied 
Petroleum (LP) Gases Specifications.
This standard amended PNS 22:1990 to cover 
the use of LPG as a motor fuel in support of the 
government’s effort to promote the utilization 
of alternative and clean technologies for the 
transport sector. Likewise, the standard improved 
the properties of LPG, not only as fuel but also for 
its other uses. 
� DPNS/DOE QS 011:2006 – Kerosene 
Specification (in progress). This draft standard 
is a proposed revision of PNS 32:1991 (kerosene 
specification).
Biofuels and its Blends:
� PNS/DOE QS 008:2006 E-Gasoline 
(10.0 percent Ethanol-Gasoline Blend) 
Specification. This standard specified the 
chemical and physical requirements for bioethanolblended gasoline (E-Gasoline) with emphasis on the 
ethanol content at 9.5-10.0 percent volume ethanol 
blend and 3.5 percent oxygen content, maximum.
� PNS/DOE QS 007:2005 Anhydrous 
Bioethanol Fuel. This is a quality standard for 
fuel grade ethanol both pure (bioethanol with 
99.3 percent purity), and denatured grade (fuel 
bioethanol with 96.9 percent purity at 2.0 percent 
ULG denaturant) for blending with gasoline for use 
as automotive spark-ignition engine fuel.
� DPNS/DOE QS 004:2007 Fatty Acid 
� PNS/DOE QS 002:2007 Coconut Methyl 
Ester (B100) Specification (Completed on 
the 2nd Quarter of 2007). This standard 
will supersede the first CME (PNS 2020:2003, 
B100) biodiesel specification. As an improvement 
to the previous standard, current specifications 
are harmonized with the European Standard for 
Biodiesel (EN 14214) and American Standard for 
Biodiesel (ASTM D6751). The standard is likewise 
harmonized with the recent biodiesel specification 
assessments conducted by Japan Automobile 
Manufacturers Association (JAMA) and the current 
Philippine studies and actual experiences on cocobiodiesel use.
� DPNS/DOE QS 010:2006 Jatropha (in 
progress). Still in the development stage, this will 
cover the use of jatropha as a potential biodiesel 
source.
Petroleum Processes and Facilities:
� PNS/DOE FS 2:2006 – LPG Refilling Plant 
Specifications. This standard covered the 
requirements for the construction, installation and 
operation of an LPG refilling plant including the 
associated bulk storage and tank farm facility with 
the exclusion of refrigerated storage tanks. 
� PNS/DOE FS 3:2006 – Auto-LPG Dispensing 
Stations. This standard is developed to address 
the emerging business of LPG used as an 
automotive fuel. This covers the requirements in 
the installation of an auto-LPG dispensing station 
for retail operation and garage-based sites, for onvehicle dispensing of LPG as automotive fuel for 
vehicles of any type. 
� PNS/DOE FS 4:2007 – Liquid Petroleum 
Product Depot (completed on the 1st 
Quarter 2007). The standard will address the 
technical requirements for facilities involved in 
the marketing and distribution of refined oils such 
as gasoline, diesel, kerosene and bunker fuel, 
to ensure product integrity. This will also provide 
for the safety of the workers, the community and 
protection of the environment.

issuance. 
Development Challenges
� Institution of safety nets to cushion the impact 
of intermittent increase in oil prices in the world 
market. 
� Improvement in the quality and safety of LPG 
cylinders in circulation. 
� Need for policy direction on oil stockpiling and oil 
reserve supply to ensure continuous and adequate 
supply.
� Enabling policy that will require the inclusion of 
household LPG pipelines in the development plan 
of new areas and emerging communities. 
Action Plan
� Develop the Malampaya oil rim for the country’s 
national reserve as a contingent measure in the 
event of oil crises or supply disruption. 
� Diversify supply sources by strengthening bilateral 
supply agreements with non-traditional suppliers 
to avert over dependence on major suppliers. 
� Encourage infrastructure development through the 
provision of Gasoline Station Lending and Financial 
Assistance Program (GSLFAP) to new players in 
the liquid fuels sector and consequently promote 
healthy retail competition. The Program is being 
implemented in cooperation with the Philippine 
� Enhance consumer safety and welfare through 
the development of an LPG Cylinder Exchange 
Program to address the growing proliferation of 
sub-standard and dilapidated LPG cylinders in 
the market. This is to promote accountability and 
responsibility on the part of the brand owners 
to maintain their own cylinders in accordance 
with set standards. The Program will likewise 
enforce standards/rules and regulation through 
appropriate policy interventions such as the Retail 
Rules for LPG and the proposed LPG Bill.
� Study the feasibility of establishing a National 
Petroleum Strategic Reserve in 2010 by putting in 
place the necessary fuel stockpile infrastructures 
and the actualization of oil discovery prospects.
� Develop and improve standards for products and 
facilities and enhance monitoring/enforcement of 
compliance with the standards to ensure adherence 
of industry players to the Retail Rules.
� Establish quality standards and an inspection/
sampling mechanism for diesel/gasoline preblended with bio-fuels.
� Formulate appropriate policy intervention to 
promote the use of pipeline for household LPG in 
the development plan of new areas and emerging 
communities.
B. NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY 
DEVELOPMENT
Natural gas is the strategic fuel of the future for 
the Philippines. It is internationally recognized as 
the cleanest and most cost-efficient among the hydro 
carbon fuels. 
Natural gas will provide for a structural change in 
the country’s energy mix and strengthen the country’s 
fuel diversification program. It will also add to energy 
security position and sustainable development as the 
country moves away from oil.
Barely five years after the commercial operation 
of the Malampaya gas field, natural gas has become 
the country’s major fuel for power generation. With 
the long-term goal of tapping this clean energy for 
other uses, the government will provide an enabling 
environment to encourage greater private sector 
Downstream Energy Into gain momentum and contributed 
the biggest share of 29.0 percent in 
the country’s power generation mix. 
This occurred despite the damages 
wrought by typhoon “Caloy” to 
some of the gas-fired facilities and 
the conduct of the first ever 25-day 
scheduled maintenance shutdown 
of the Malampaya platform.
In Luzon, 40.0 percent of total 
electricity generation came from 
natural gas-fired power plants, i.e. 
the 1,200-MW Ilijan Power Plant, 
the 1,000-MW Sta. Rita Power 
Plant and the 500-MW San Lorenzo 
Power Plant, all of which are 
located in the province of Batangas 
and the 3-MW San Antonio Power 
Plant in the Province of Isabela. The 
combined generation amounted to 
16,366 GWh and utilized 99,527 
MMSCF of natural gas in 2006 to 
run these power plants. 
Natural gas is also being used 
by the Pilipinas Shell Refinery for its 
use in 2006, the refinery consumed 
a total of 2,257 MMSCF. 
On the other hand, the 
demonstration program promoting 
the use of CNG in public utility 
buses consumed an estimated 
volume of 13,780 SCF of gas. 
This was mainly sourced from the 
San Antonio gas field in Echague, 
Isabela, which is about 370 
kilometers from Manila. 
As of end�2006, the 
refurbishment of the country’s first 
mother-daughter station continued to 
be pursued to address the technical 
and safety requirements prior to its 
commercial operation. The system 
is expected to be fully operational 
before the end of 2007. Twenty-two 
units of public utility buses plying 
the routes of Laguna and Batangas 
going to Metro Manila will kick off 
this pilot project. 
infrastructure facilities for 
the downstream natural gas 
industry, primarily the network 
of high and low pressure gas

and pumping stations to ensure 
that natural gas is delivered 
continuously to all demand

� Need for an integrated set 
of laws, regulations and 
incentives to encourage private 
sector support on the required 
investments while at the same 
time, ensuring public safety 
and protection.
� Need for highly-skilled and 
highly-trained manpower for 
the natural gas industry.
Action Plan 
 
To increase the utilization 
of natural gas, the Philippines is 
vigorously promoting its use in the 
Figure 22. NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS
Downstream Energy Inis intensifying exploration for indigenous gas deposits 
and studying options for economically using imported 
LNG. The private sector is also encouraged to assist 
government in developing the natural gas industry
Developing the country’s natural gas industry 
entails strategic plans and programs to be carried 
out in short, medium and long terms to leapfrog its 
development and ensure competitiveness. The energy 
sector will therefore pursue the following activities, 
plans and programs:
Infrastructure Facilities Network
� Form strong public-private partnerships for the 
development of the natural gas industry, particularly 
on the identified infrastructure projects as follows 
(with corresponding indicative year of completion 
and operation): 
 Pilot CNG mother-daughter station (2007);
 Batangas-Manila (Batman 1) Pipeline (2010);
 CNG Refilling Stations for Metro Manila 
(2010);
 Sucat-Fort Bonifacio pipeline (2011);
 Bataan-Manila (Batman 2) Pipeline (2012);
 LNG terminal in Limay (2012);
 Metro Manila Gas Loop (EDSA-Taft Loop) 
(2015); and
 Connection to Trans-ASEAN Gas Pipeline 
(TAGP) via Mindanao (2015).
Market Development
� Prioritize the use of natural gas to fuel the additional 
capacity requirements in the power sector starting 
in 2010 for Luzon, as well as mandate the 
conversion of oil-thermal plants such as Sucat and 
Limay to be fueled by natural gas.
� Promote the expanded use of natural gas in 
transport, industry, buildings and agriculture in 
2010.
Manpower Capability Building
� Establish a Philippine Natural Gas Institute to 
serve as a policy think-tank center for natural gas. 
However, it could start as the national training 
center and venue for workshops, conferences and 
trainings on the operation of natural gas facilities. 
The Institute shall supply the manpower requirement 
for the industry.

A. ENVIRONMENTAL 
MANAGEMENT AND PROTECTION
 The sector’s conscious efforts to address 
environmental sustainability is never more apparent 
in its policy thrusts to promote the development and 
use of environment-friendly fuels such as renewable 
and alternative energy sources and intensify its energy 
efficiency and conservation programs, among others. 
Likewise, cognizant of the consequent effects of energy 
development to the environment, the DOE continues 
to implement various intervention programs to ensure 
ecologically-sound energy project implementation. It is 
actively engaged in various inter-agency initiatives to 
address environment-related issues and concerns. In 
August 2007, the DOE was tasked to take the lead in 
the country’s over-all campaign to mitigate the impact 
of climate change.
 
INTER-AGENCY INITIATIVES
Multi-partite Monitoring Team (MMT).
To ensure compliance of energy/power projects to 
environmental regulations and standards, and to the 
Environmental Management and Monitoring Plans 
(EMMP) as stipulated in the Environmental Compliance 
Certificate (ECC) issued to proponents, the DOE 
actively participates in MMT activities that include 
regular monitoring of air and water quality within the 
project vicinity and the socio-economic and livelihood 
projects implemented in the host communities in line 
with their Corporate Social Responsibility. Further to 
its mandate in the MMT, the DOE ensures the project’s 
sound environmental stewardship. It assists in the 
settlement of possible disputes that may arise in the 
project implementation and promotes cooperation 
and harmony among the stakeholders. It also sees to 
it that samples and observations are collected with

Environmental Impact Assessment Review 
Committee (EIARC). Under the framework of the 
Philippine Environmental Impact Statement System 
(PEISS), the DOE provides technical support and advice 
to the EIARC in the evaluation of energy projects. The 
PEISS is a process that determines the environmental 
impact of a given project and the corresponding 
monitoring and mitigating measures that have to be 
implemented by the project proponent. 
In 2007, the DOE participated and completed the 
review of the environmental impact analysis for the 
PNOC-EDC’s 50 to 120-MW Mindanao Geothermal 
Power Project. In process is the review of the Brixton’s 
Coal Mine Project in Zamboanga Sibugay and 
Philsystems Coal Mine Project in Bulalacao, Mindoro. 
Metro Manila Air Shed Governing Board 
(MMASGB). The DOE has been involved in the 
activities of the Metro Manila Air Shed Governing 
Board in support to the objectives of the Clean Air Act. 
The MMASGB formulates policies and action plans, 
ensures implementation of programs, and monitors and 
evaluates the performance and compliance of partners in 
achieving cleaner air in the Metro Manila air shed. The 
proposed geo-political coverage of the air shed includes 
25 cities and 83 municipalities from the NCR, Region III

National Disaster Coordinating Council 
(NDCC). The establishment of the NDCC is embodied 
in Section 2 of Presidential Decree 1566. The DOE is 
one of the 18 member agencies of the NDCC, which 
is headed by the Secretary of National Defense. It is 
tasked to ensure the safety and immediate restoration 
of power installations in affected areas during times of 
calamities such as typhoons and floods.
The NDCC implements a Four-Point Action Plan to 
promote disaster preparedness, to wit: (1) mechanisms 
for government and private sector partnership in relief 
and rehabilitation; (2) public information campaign on 
disaster preparedness; (3) capacity building for LGUs 
in identified vulnerable areas; and, (4) forecasting 
capability upgrading for PAGASA and PHILVOLCS.
Committee on Energy Projects in NIPAS 
Areas (CEPNA). The objective of CEPNA is to 
identify and delineate all energy projects within the 
NIPAS coverage and formulate measures that will 
create or develop resource use complementation 
and harmonization towards sustainable development 
principles. The Committee undertakes the identification 
and reconciliation of its programs with overlapping 
location with respect to protected areas. Mapping 
of identified potential energy resources located in 
proclaimed or proposed protected areas is being 
undertaken by the DOE to assist prospective investors 
in identifying possible energy projects and to expedite 
the process of providing accurate and complete 
information. 
CLIMATE CHANGE INITIATIVES
The energy sector is committed to ensure that the 
country’s environment is not jeopardized by energy 
undertakings. To this end, various climate change 
Qualifying Projects for Clean Development 
Mechanism (CDM). The CDM is one of the 
mechanisms or systems established under the Kyoto 
Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The 
others, which are for developed or Annex I parties 
under the Convention are the Joint Implementation 
and Emissions Trading. The CDM aims to provide 
investments in more efficient and less GHG generating 
projects and activities in exchange for the countries’ 
contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas 
emissions. President Arroyo signed E.O. No. 320 
on 25 June 2004 designating the DENR as the 
Designated National Authority (DNA) for CDM. On 
the other hand, the DOE takes the lead role in the 
evaluation of energy-related projects.
As of April 2007, the DNA has approved a total 
of 36 CDM projects and nine of which have been 
registered with the CDM Executive Board. However, 
only one project activity, the wind project, has so 
far requested Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) 
from the CDM Executive Board. Examples of these 
projects are other renewable energy power projects 
like geothermal, biomass and other wastes-to-energy 
projects.

Operationalization 
of the Presidential 
Task Force on Climate 
Change (PTFCC). In 
response to the country’s 
vulnerability to the impact 
of climate change, which 
is compounded by the 
location of the Philippines 
being both in the typhoon 
belt and the ring of fire, President G. M. Arroyo signed 
A.O. No. 171 Creating the Presidential Task Force on 
Climate Change (PTFCC) on 20 February 2007. The 
PTFCC is composed of the Cabinet Secretaries of the 
following government agencies – DENR, DOE, DOST, 
DA and DILG and representatives from the private Other Energy Pro
Secretary as the Chairman 
and the DENR Secretary as 
the Vice-Chairman of the 
PTFCC, respectively. The 
amendment also included 
new members such as the 
Department of Education and 
the Commission on Higher 
Education. This is consistent 
with the international trend 
of focusing the integration of programs, policies and 
projects into the sectors responsible for the generation 
of GHG and/or those significantly affected by climate 
change, and in the case of the Philippines, it is the 
energy sector. 
The Task Force is mandated to do the following: 
 Conduct rapid assessment on the impacts 
of climate change, particularly on the most 
vulnerable sectors/areas of water resources, 
agriculture, coastal areas, terrestrial and 
marine ecosystems, among others; 
 Ensure strict compliance to air emission 
standards and act with urgency to combat 
deforestation and environmental degradation 
and apprehend violators;
 Undertake/initiate strategic approaches and 
measures to prevent or reduce GHG emissions 
including fuel efficiency, energy conservation, 
use of renewable energy, waste management, 
etc;
 Conduct a massive and comprehensive 
public information and awareness campaign 
nationwide to educate the public on the climate 
change situation and its adverse impacts and 
mobilize multi-sectoral action; 
 Design concrete risk reduction and mitigation 
measures and adaptation responses, especially 
to address short-term vulnerabilities, on sectors 
and areas where climate change will have the 
greatest impact;
 Collaborate with international partners at 
the bilateral, regional and multilateral levels 
to support a global front to stabilize GHG 
emissions and institute mitigating and adaptive 
measures, especially for developing countries; 
and
climate change response framework and includes all 
the current and proposed projects of member agencies 
and private sector initiatives on climate change. This 
was presented to President G. M. Arroyo during the 
First National Conference on Climate Change held in 
Albay in November 2007.
The response framework is consistent with the 
global action agenda on climate change. It is both 
comprehensive and holistic, synchronizes disparate 
efforts across disciplines, agencies and sectors under 
one common strategy for maximum impact and has 
a strong bias for local efforts and interventions. 
The Framework also hinges on the mitigation and 
adaptation responses through technological advances 
and financial resources in cooperation with all sectors 
of society and the international community.
The PTFCC also participated in the Bali Climate 
Change Conference of the UNFCCC in December 
2007. Among the major decisions that will affect the 
non-Annex countries including the Philippines include 
the Transfer of Technology and Financing Mechanisms 
under the Convention and the grouping of small scale 
CDM projects as well as increasing the sequestration 
limit for small scale afforestation and reforestation 
projects under the Protocol. 
CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS IN 
THE ENERGY SECTOR 
To bring climate change to a halt, global greenhouse 
gas emissions particularly from the burning of fossil 
fuels must be reduced significantly. 
 
Total CO2 emissions from the use of fossil fuels 
consisting of oil, coal and natural gas decreased 
by 2.15 percent from the 71.40 MMMT in 2005 to 
69.87 MMMT in 2006. Specifically, CO2 emissions 
from the use of oil and oil products dropped by 
3.31 percent from 44.62 MMMT in 2005 to 43.14 
MMMT in 2006, while emissions from natural gas also 
decreased by 6.32 percent from 6.28 MMMT to 5.88 
MMMT for the periods in review. However, there was 
a slight increase of CO2 emissions from the use of coal 
by 1.66 percent from 20.51 MMMT in 2005 to 20.85 
MMMT in 2006. 
In terms of power generation, total CO2 emissions 
from fossil fuel-based power plants decreased by 12.68 
percent from 26.23 MMMT in 2005 to 22.90 MMMT 
in 2006. Oil-fired power plants’ CO2 emissions went 
down by 26.7 percent from 2005 level of 4.15 MMMT COUNTRIES
 International energy cooperation is seen as 
vital in pursuing collaborative activities with other 
countries to realize our goal of achieving greater 
energy self-sufficiency level, energy security and 
sustainability. Having limited energy resources and 
insufficient infrastructure support, forging strategic 
alliances through bilateral, regional and multilateral 
agreements is a potent option in advancing the 
country’s energy agenda. To date, the government 
continuously participates in international fora and 
dialogues like the ASEAN Ministers on Energy 
Meeting-Senior Officials’ Meeting on Energy (AMEMSOME), the APEC Energy Ministers Meeting (APECEMM) and APEC-Energy Working Group Meeting 
(APEC-EMM), the International Energy Forum (IEF), 
and more recently, the Asia Cooperation Dialogue 
(ACD).
In the planning horizon, the Philippines will remain 
an energy importing country and thus, international 
energy cooperation engagement will provide a 
window for diversifying energy sources, attracting 
foreign investments, promoting transfer of technology 
and exchanging information and expertise.
BILATERAL COOPERATION
There are several bilateral agreements that 
the Philippines entered into with foreign countries, 
agencies and institutions through MOA, MOU, 
Memoranda of Intent, Memoranda of Cooperation 
and other instruments. Such agreements could 
facilitate investment, energy supply arrangement/
agreement, and joint ventures on energy exploration 
and development, among others. Following are the 
bilateral agreements with other countries: 
RP-US
In March 2007, the DOE and the United States 
Geological Services (USGS) signed an MOU on Scientific 
and Technical Cooperation in the Earth Sciences. The 
Agreement provides the framework for the exchange 
of scientific and technical knowledge between the two 
countries in the energy sector.
As an initial collaborative undertaking, the USGS 
and the DOE are currently undertaking the “Joint 
Assessment of Coal-bed Methane and Coal Resources 
in the Coalfields in the Philippines”. Under this activity, 
the Philippines shall acquire new knowledge and 
technology in coal resource assessment including 
Other Energy Prog
energy sources (hydro, geothermal, solar and wind); (3) 
implementation of energy efficiency and conservation 
measures; (4) installation of pollution control technologies 
to comply with air quality standards; (5) use of advanced 
energy technologies such as combined-cycle units and 
combined heat and power (CHP) systems; and, (6) 
carbon sequestration projects (e.g. reforestation projects) 
implemented by power plants and other manufacturing 
industries.
Development Challenges
� Need to promote and sustain social acceptability 
of energy projects due to associated environmental 
concerns, which cause delays in project 
implementation.
� Need to integrate, align and merge climate 
change objectives with the challenge of providing 
affordable and sustainable energy to the country.
Action Plan
The following courses of actions are identified 
to further strengthen the initiatives on environmental 
management program:
� Continue to collaborate with energy project 
proponents and concerned local government units 
to address social acceptability issues of energy 
projects.
� Strengthen participation in various inter-agency 
activities on environmental issues.
� Pursue the development of an energy-environment 
database system of power projects to serve as 
DOE’s monitoring and policy decision-making tool 
on energy-environment issues.
� Implement climate change programs, projects and 
activities like mitigation mechanisms, vulnerability 
assessment of energy projects and facilities, 
energy efficiency projects and IEC campaigns, 
among others.

 (2.15)to manage disputes and develop friendly relations 
between ASEAN member countries and China, 
the Tripartite Agreement for Joint Marine Seismic 
Undertaking (JMSU) among China National Offshore 
Oil Corporation (CNOOC), Vietnam Oil and Gas 
Corporation (PETROVIETNAM) and the PNOC 
has already proceeded with Phase II of its work 
program.
The JSMU covers an area of 142,866 sq. km. in the 
South China Sea with a three-year term that commenced 
on 14 March 2005. Under Phase I of the agreement, 
2D seismic acquisition was undertaken in September 
to mid November 2005. Meanwhile, processing and 
reprocessing of new and vintage seismic data were 
also carried out from December 2005 until December 
2006.
The JMSU in the South China Sea has progressed 
very well and demonstrated the way forward in 
transforming the South China Sea into an area of 
friendship and cooperation. Survey results showed 
valid economic reasons why the Tripartite Agreement 
is being pursued for the second phase.
The Philippines is keen on advancing the 
Agreement and will explore the possibility of pursuing 
Joint Development Agreement (JDA) with the parties 
involved should results of the seismic interpretation turn 
out to be highly prospective in terms of oil and gas 
reserves in the covered area.
RP-Russia
Russia holds the world’s largest natural gas 
reserves with 1,680 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of gas, and 
the second largest coal reserves with 173 billion tons 
of recoverable reserves. In addition, Russia has also 
proven oil reserves of 60 billion barrels. Russia is the 
world’s largest exporter of natural gas and the second 
largest oil exporter. In 2006, Russia announced its 
intention to supply about 30.0 percent of Asia’s oil 
requirement in the next 10-15 years. 
The Philippines has previously sourced oil from 
Russia and thus, the intention is to resume negotiations 
between the two countries for supply of oil (a number 
of meetings had taken place between government 
officials and an invitation was extended to the Russians 
to visit the Philippines). An energy experts’ meeting 
may be convened as a venue to discuss possible 
areas of cooperation between the two countries, such 
as the establishment of an oil refinery, construction of 
an LNG receiving and re-gasification terminal with an 
Other Energy Pro
requirements having vast reserves of oil, gas and coal. 
A number of agreements had been signed between 
the two countries to ensure supply as well as to find 
opportunities for collaboration in energy exploration 
and development.
In early 2006, the Philippines within the purview 
of the BIMP-EAGA, initiated discussions with Indonesia 
to pursue further collaboration in the energy sector 
especially in the areas of coal supply to the Philippines. 
Initially, Indonesian President Yodhoyono agreed to 
explore discussions on long-term coal supply to the 
Philippines and geothermal development in Indonesia. 
Proposed draft agreements were exchanged and 
discussions between energy missions of the two 
countries had taken place. Currently, the two countries 
are exerting efforts to sign a formal agreement.
MULTILATERAL COOPERATION
The Philippines is also actively participating in 
regional energy cooperation. Over the years, it has 
aggressively taken bold initiatives in ASEAN, APEC, 
ACD, ASEM and East Asia Summit, among others.
The Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations (ASEAN)
Member countries of ASEAN have undertaken 
energy cooperation activities since the group’s 
formation in 1967. Currently, the regional projects 
that have been carried out and continued to be 
implemented are under the framework of the ASEAN 
Plan of Action on Energy Cooperation (APAEC) 2004-
2009. Among the major cross-border projects of the 
ASEAN are the ASEAN Power Grid and the TransASEAN Gas Pipeline. The other cooperation activities 
are in the areas of coal, renewable energy, energy 
efficiency and regional energy planning.
A major initiative in the region is the ASEAN 
Petroleum Security Agreement (APSA). The agreement 
provides for the sharing of oil supply among member 
countries in times of shortages. The Philippines initiated 
a review of this Agreement in 1999 and it is expected 
that the new draft of the APSA will be signed by the 
Energy Ministers.
Likewise, under the ASEAN + 3 (China, Japan, 
Korea) Energy Partnership, the common goal for greater 
energy security and sustainability in the region is given 
great emphasis amidst projection that the region 
would become the largest energy consuming region 
in the world. The member countries are committed to The Philippines is a member of APEC and actively 
participates in the initiatives of the APEC EWG, which 
facilitates energy trade and investment. In 2001, 
the APEC Economic Leaders endorsed the Energy 
Security Initiative (ESI). The Initiative includes shortterm measures to respond to temporary energy supply 
disruptions, as well as long-term policy responses to 
energy security concerns. Being a member economy of 
the APEC, the Philippines is involved in the following 
key areas of the ESI:
1. Joint Oil Data Initiative (JODI)
2. Sea-Lane Security
3. Real-Time Emergency Information Sharing
4. Oil Supply Emergency Response
5. Non-Petroleum and Long Term Measures
Asia Cooperation Dialogue (ACD)
The ACD was created in 2002 to promote Asian 
cooperation at the continental level with the aim of 
integrating member countries of previously separate 
political or economic regional organizations such 
as ASEAN, South Asian Association for Regional 
Cooperation (SAARC) or the Gulf Cooperation 
Council. The Dialogue serves as a platform to discuss 
Asia-wide cooperation. 
The Philippines is one of the co-prime movers on 
energy together with Bahrain, China, Indonesia, Iran 
and Qatar. Likewise, the Philippines is principally 
involved in the drafting of the ACD Action Plan in 
collaboration with Indonesia to further advance 
energy cooperation in the region. The Philippines will 
host a key ACD conference on energy that will focus 
on developing alternative and renewable energy 
sources.
East Asia Summit (EAS)
Following the signing of the Cebu Declaration 
on East Asia Energy Security by the Heads of State/
Government of the Member Countries of ASEAN 
and its dialogue partners during the 2nd EAS held 
in January 2007 in Cebu, the Leaders endorsed the 
establishment of a working group to study possible 
areas of cooperation among EAS members to enhance 
energy security. Following this directive, the EAS-Energy 
Cooperation Task Force (ECTF) was established with 
three identified areas of cooperation namely: biofuels 
for transport and other uses, market integration, and 
energy efficiency. The Philippines is designated as 
the lead country for the working group on biofuels 
for transport and other usesThe working group has 
consumers meet to discuss issues on production, 
demand outlook and regional prospects as well as 
the energy and economic Interdependence between 
energy producing and consuming countries. 
During its most recent meeting in Riyadh in May 
2007, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia – major supplier 
of crude oil – has committed to continue in providing 
oil supply requirement of the country as well as fill in 
any shortages of supply from other sources. 
The Energy Charter Treaty (ECT)
The Philippines’ application for observer status in 
conferences in the Energy Charter Treaty has already 
been approved and is due for formal signing. The 
ECT is an international agreement signed in Lisbon 
in December 1994. It is a legally-binding multilateral 
framework for energy cooperation in the context 
of establishing a legal foundation for global energy 
security and open, competitive markets and sustainable 
development. Among its fundamental aims is the 
creation of a level playing field to be observed by all 
participating governments, thereby promoting energyrelated investments and trade.
As observer, the Philippines may participate in 
the ECT conference, in the working groups as well as 
in its activities. The country may also gain access to 
the Charter’s pool of knowledge and documents. The 
ultimate full membership to the Conference and the 
adoption of the Treaty by the Philippines is foreseen to 
increase trade and investments in the energy sector. 
C. CONSUMER WELFARE AND 
PROTECTION
The government aims to build a broad base of 
well-informed, responsible and vigilant consumers. 
It also encourages consumers to play a more active 
role in policy formulation and decision-making, which 
will impact on future energy choices and consumption 
patterns.
Performance Assessment
The DOE, through its Consumer Welfare and 
Promotion Office (CWPO), is gaining headway in 
empowering energy consumers to effect long-term 
socio-economic change and improved environmental 
sustainability. An empowered consumer is said to 
be an educated consumer who knows his rights and 
responsibilities. This precept is an integral component 
Other Energy ProThe conduct of IEC also extends to foreign-funded 
projects such as the UNDP-GEF PELMATP focusing on 
the use of energy-efficient lighting systems, CBRED and 
other programs supporting the use of clean fuels such 
as natural gas, autoLPG, bioethanol, and biodiesel.
Another empowering mechanism involves 
broadening networks with consumer groups, 
government agencies, and forging partnership with 
academic institutions, such as the University of the 
Philippines-Los Baños and agencies such as the 
Department of Trade and Industry for the establishment 
of Energy Watch Teams in City/Municipal Consumer 
Protection Centers. The Team is intended to promptly 
address the energy issues at the grassroots level. The 
DOE-DTI-LGU collaboration has been found to be 
an effective vehicle in curbing unscrupulous energy 
trade practices through vigilant monitoring and 
inspection.
Likewise, in response to the call of President 
Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to bring the government’s 
program closer to the people, the energy “Common 
Folk’s Day” was institutionalized. It has also been 
integrated with the “Serbisyo Muna Caravan” with 
the objective of responding to the consumer concerns 
in real time. The DOE’s Gender and Development 
Program has likewise addressed specific gender 
issues attributable to energy activities.
In the area of research, the CWPO has initiated 
a program called Academic Research Assistance 
Program (or DOE-AREA) with the De La Salle College of 
Engineering as its first beneficiary. This is to support the 
research activities of the government and subsequently, 
enhance the capabilities of students. Thesis counseling 
has been part of the ongoing efforts to align researches 
with the needs of the energy sector. 
The DOE continues to address specific consumer 
needs and offers consumer assistance through the 
Enertxt, e-mail, phone-in, and walk-in services and 
assists in student researches, verification of household 
energy bills, and other consumer requirements. 
Development Challenges 
� Intensifying IEC campaign to address issues on 
renewable energy, implementation of the Biofuels 
Act of 2006 and other energy policies.
� Continuing and sustaining the education and 
awareness program on consumer protection and 
energy-related issues.
Other Energy Pro
professional organizations and civil society to 
strengthen consumer advocacy programs.
� Institutionalize Energy Watch Team in city/
municipality levels in key provinces/cities such as 
Palawan, Ilocos Norte, Bicol, Quezon, and Subic
� Create a database of energy researches and 
technical papers to provide ready reference for 
literature reviews and pursue efforts in the energy 
fields found viable, and avoid any research or 
project duplication
� Maintain partnership with educational institutions 
and private sector in undertaking energy-related 
researches and activities. Aside from the De La 
Salle University, other universities will also be 
tapped for DOE-AREA program, namely: University 
of Santo Tomas, Mapua Institute of Technology, 
Adamson University, Polytechnic University of 
the Philippines, University of the Philippines-Los 
Baños, Miriam College, St. Paul’s College, among 
others.
D. NUCLEAR POWER AS A 
LONG-TERM ENERGY OPTION 
 The continuing volatility of oil prices in the world 
market, the concern about global warming due to 
greenhouse gas emissions, and the growing emphasis 
on energy security has resurrected nuclear power 
as one of the most viable energy sources. This new 
wave of interest on nuclear power in the international 
energy circles has led to what may aptly be called the 
“nuclear renaissance.” As a net energy importer, the 
Philippines is once again looking into the prospects 
of developing a nuclear power program to support its 
own development needs. It has considered nuclear as 
a long-term energy option.
INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL 
DEVELOPMENTS ON NUCLEAR 
POWER
As of April 2006, there were 443 nuclear power 
reactors in operation in 30 countries, an aggregate 
capacity of 370 GW and supplies about 16.0 percent 
of the world’s electricity requirement (Figure 23). Of 
this total, 405 nuclear reactors or about 91.0 percent 
are installed in either the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries or Renewables

Among the countries in Asia, Japan has the largest 
nuclear power program, with 56 reactors currently 
in operation, followed by the Republic of Korea with 
20 units in operation, providing about 45.0 percent 
of the country’s power requirement. While Asia’s 
absolute and relative contribution to nuclear power 
is still small, significant developments are expected to 
happen within the region especially with the aggressive 
expansion plans of both India and China (Figure 24). 
Currently, India has 15 operating reactors with eight 
additional units under construction. Meanwhile, China 
has nine reactors in operation and three more units 
under construction.
Figure 24. STATUS OF NUCLEAR DEVELOPMENT IN EAST ASIA
Other Energy Pro
concluded SOME of the 25 AMEM held on 20 August 
2007, the proposal of host country Singapore for the 
establishment of a regional sub-sector network on nuclear 
energy was among the important topics discussed. The 
said sub-sector network will be tasked to explore issues 
relating to nuclear energy and develop an ASEAN-wide 
cooperation and programmes in this area. 
To date, three ASEAN-member countries have made 
pronouncements on their plans of mainstreaming nuclear 
in their respective power generation mix. Indonesia has 
confirmed its plan of building a 4,000-MW nuclear 
power plant in Mt. Muria in Central Java and expected 
to be operational between 2016 to 2018. Vietnam 
on the other hand, has been working closely with 
the Japanese government in the last five years for the 
conduct of feasibility studies on building nuclear power 
plants in specific sites. It plans to operate its first nuclear 
power facility before 2018 with an initial capacity of 
around 2,000 MW. Currently, about 20 Vietnamese 
nationals are undergoing training under the support of 
Japan’s Ministry of Energy, Trade and Industry (METI). 
Meanwhile, Thailand has indicated that 16.0 percent 
of its generating capacities to be built between 2012 
and 2021 will come from nuclear sources as laid down 
in its recently approved 15-year PDP. An integral part 
of the Plan is an intensive IEC campaign on the possible 
entry of nuclear. 
THE PHILIPPINE 
APPROACH
Long-Term Need
Since the creation of the DOE 
in 1992, only the PEP covering 
the planning period 1998-2035 
incorporated nuclear as a long-term 
energy supply option. The 1998 Plan 
forecast developed four scenarios to 
determine its sensitivity to different 
energy policy alternatives and the 
impact of regional cooperation 
programs. Under the said Plan, a 
600-MW nuclear plant which will be 
operational by 2025 will contribute 
an initial volume of 0.885 MTOE 
to the projected energy mix and 
reach up to 3.54 MTOE by 2035. 
Additional nuclear capacities of 600 
MW were simulated to be in place 
by 2027, 2030 and 2034. Thus, 
total capacity from nuclear under human resource capability building and enhancement 
as a necessary prelude in considering nuclear power 
as a long-term energy option. Capability building 
and enhancement on the various aspects of nuclear 
energy will involve training of local manpower for 
the possible introduction of nuclear into the country’s 
energy system. 
The decision to mothball the Philippine Nuclear 
Power Plant (PNPP) in 1986 left a void in harnessing 
and further developing local expertise on nuclear. 
The report of the Nuclear Power Steering Committee 
(NPSC) completed in 1998, cited that “there is a need 
for a slow but calculated build-up of the manpower 
base using young engineers and technologists.” Former 
President Fidel V. Ramos created the NPSC in 1995 by 
virtue of E.O. No. 243 to provide policies, direction, 
monitoring, evaluation, and other functions necessary 
and appropriate to attain the objectives of the overall 
Nuclear Power Program of the country. 
Currently, the DOE is leading an inter-agency 
discussion among concerned government agencies, the 
academe and private sector to thresh-out possibilities on 
re-building local technical capability in nuclear sciences 
and engineering. At present the manpower capability 
of NPC in nuclear engineering has declined from the 
original number of 710 engineers who were trained by 
Westinghouse and EBASCO Overseas Corporation in 
the 1980’s to 106 many of whom are now bound for 
retirement in the next five to ten years.
Options for Philippine Nuclear Power 
Plant-1 (PNPP-1)
Planning for the introduction of nuclear energy in 
the country will alternately need to settle the question 
of what to do with the mothballed PNPP-1 in Morong, 
Bataan. Two broad options can be considered: 
rehabilitation and conversion.
Other Energy Pro
with experience in countries such as USA, Romania, 
Argentina, among others where nuclear plants that 
were similarly mothballed in 1985 are now being 
rehabilitated. The feasibility of rehabilitating the plant 
should be referred to the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) for technical assistance. Whether the 
actual rehabilitation of PNPP-1 should be done by the 
government or contracted to the private sector is a 
policy issue that will be addressed later.
Although many studies were conducted in the past 
on converting PNPP-1 for other fuel, there is a need to 
update these studies to current economic and technical 
conditions. This study can be conducted in parallel 
with the rehabilitation study that can be entirely done 
by the NPC. VII. Investment Portfolio
Investment Po
In pursuit of the energy 
sector’s agenda to attain energy 
independence and promote a 
competitive energy sector, Table 
41 summarizes the country’s 
energy investment requirements 
amounting to PhP 1,420.41 billion 
from 2007 to 2014. The infusion 
of fresh capital and the firming up 
of financial commitment from the 
industry players and stakeholders 
are the essential factors in realizing 
the energy sector goals. In line 
with this, the Department will 
intensify efforts to encourage active 
participation of the private sector 
in the different energy business 
opportunities.
FOSSIL FUEL RESOURCES
Oil and Gas
The PECR, which also covers 
the geothermal and coal sectors, 
continuously encouraged local 
and international investors in the 
exploration, development and 
production of petroleum resources 
in the country. In the 2005 PECR, 
four petroleum contract areas were 
offered to the stakeholders. As a 
result, the following contracts 
were awarded in 2006 to the 
following: (i) PNOC-EC/Nido 
Petroleum, Pty. Ltd for Area 1 in 
Southwest Palawan; (ii) Burgundy 
Global Exploration Corporation 
for Area 2 in Northeast Palawan

will entail PhP 341.27 billion. The 
requirement of PhP 398.51 billion 
for the entire petroleum sector 
is expected to be provided by 
the private sector. In 2007, four 
petroleum service contractors have 
committed to pour in investments 
of at least US$ 153.0 million for 
offshore drilling of five exploration 
wells. Malaysia’s Petronas Carigali 
Overseas Bhd. has started drilling 
one exploration well in Mindoro 
with a total investment of US$ 23.0 
million; Galoc Production Company 
will drill two production wells in 
Northwest Palawan and allocated 
US$ 86.4 million; Japan Petroleum 
Exploration Company will drill one 
exploration well in Tañon Strait 
with an investment of at least US$ 
37.0 million; and the Singaporebased Premier Oil will drill one 
areas were offered but the bids 
tendered did not meet the technical 
criteria. Notwithstanding, 15 coal 
operating contracts were carried 
out by 11 companies in areas in 
Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao 
that generated about PhP 290.00 
million in 2005. In the 2006 PECR, 
14 coal prospects were offered for 
the exploration, development and 
production in Quezon, Negros 
Occidental, Cebu, Surigao del 
Norte, Surigao del Sur, Agusan 
del Sur, Davao Oriental and 
Zamboanga Sibugay. The bids 
submitted are estimated to bring 
in PhP 91.97 million worth of 
investments. Further, the existing 
COCs in 2006 yielded PhP 
5,759.0 billion for the exploration, 
development and production of 
indigenous coal. 
The total investment requirement 
for the coal sector in the planning 
period is estimated at PhP 139.16 
billion for 1,000 MW as shown 
in Table 43 (Annex A.1.20). From 
the said amount, PhP 20.57 billion 
will be used to develop potential 
areas in Luzon, PhP 51.43 billion 
for Visayas and PhP 30.86 billion 
for Mindanao. In addition, the mine 
investment, which includes capital 
outlay, operating cost among others, 
will require PhP 36.31 billion. 
RENEWABLE ENERGY 
The Department is continuously 
promoting the use of indigenous and 
renewable energy resources. As a 
result, a number of projects had 
been initiated and implemented by 
the private sector. With this trend, it 
is projected that a total investment of 
PhP 258.34 billion will be required 
in the entire planning period for 
the development and promotion of 
renewable energy resources.

In the 2006 PECR, on the other hand, three prospective 
areas were offered in Batangas, Biliran and 
Compostela Valley. The bids submitted are expected to 
generate US$ 3.15 million. For the planning period, 
a total of PhP 61.63 billion in investments is required 
for the operation of geothermal areas including the 
exploration and development of 580-MW potential 
capacity all over the country. From this total amount, 
PhP 20.17 billion will come from the government and 
PhP 41.46 billion from the private sector. Table 44 
(Annex A.1.21) indicates that the projects in Luzon 
will entail PhP 37.82 billion in which PhP 10.39 
billion will be provided by the government and PhP 
27.43 billion by the private sector. The Visayas area 
will need PhP 11.50 billion, with PhP 8.25 billion 
to be provided by the government and PhP 3.25 
billion to be sourced from the private sector. Lastly, 
the Mindanao area will require PhP 12.31 billion in 
capital investment with PhP 1.53 billion coming from 
the government sector and PhP 10.78 billion from the 
private investors. 
Hydropower
To further increase the share of hydropower in the 
energy mix, there are still 41 potential hydropower 
sites with a total capacity of 1,025.10 MW that 
could be tapped. Development of these sites would 
require PhP 114.81 billion in capital investments over 
the entire planning period. Table 45 (Annex A.1.22) 
shows that in Luzon, the capital requirement is PhP 
57.97 billion, while Visayas and Mindanao need 
Biomass 
The private sector has been very active in the 
implementation of biomass projects. Listed in Table 46 
(Annex A.1.23) are the biomass projects that could 
generate a potential capacity of 183.90 MW with a 
total investment requirement estimated at PhP 19.57 
billion. These projects are mostly situated in Luzon and 
in the Visayas region.
Wind
As an offshoot of the Northwind Project in Ilocos 
Norte, the private sector has been gaining grounds in 
the development of wind energy. Additional sites have 
been identified which increased the potential capacity 
to 556 MW. The total investment requirement detailed in 
Table 47 (Annex A.1.24) amounts to PhP 62.33 billion.
ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORT FUELS 
In line with the Government’s goal to reduce 
dependence from fossil fuels, the DOE is continuously 
promoting the utilization of alternative fuels for transport 
such as biodiesel (CME), bioethanol, CNG and autogas 
(autoLPG). The Biofuels Act is expected to further spur 
investments on the production of biodiesel and bioethanol. 
In addition, jatropha curcass is gaining popularity as a 
potential source of biodiesel. The PNOC’s Alternative 
Fuel Corporation is currently conducting studies in the 
determination of the best variety to be planted, cost 
effectiveness, efficient processing to biodiesel, etc. Table

ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND 
CONSERVATION
The energy sector will continue to undertake an 
aggressive campaign to promote energy efficiency and 
conservation. The DOE has lined up several activities 
which will require PhP 48.69 billion in capital investments 
as shown in Table 49 (Annex A.1.29). From this amount, 
PhP 43.77 billion will be sourced from private investors 
while the remaining PhP 4.92 billion will come from the 
government. Activities on energy labeling and efficiency 
standards will constitute the biggest share at PhP 29.72 
billion, followed by the energy management programs 
at PhP 16.10 billion. Meanwhile, the continuing IEC 
campaign will entail PhP 622.0 million. On the other 
hand, the government enercon program will need PhP 
2.25 billion while the voluntary agreement program 
will require PhP 1.40 million.
POWER AND TRANSMISSION 
DEVELOPMENT
In line with the power sector’s objective to provide 
reliable, adequate and quality supply of electricity 
in the main grid, a total investment of PhP 505.63 
billion, which includes committed power generation 
projects, will be required from both the government 
and private sectors.
Power Generation
Based on the demand forecasts, a total of 4,472.50 
MW indicative generation projects for the main grid will 
require a total investment of PhP 399.49 billion for the 
entire planning period. Table 50 (Annex A.1. 27) shows 
the investment requirements for the indicative power plants 
to be distributed as follows: for Luzon PhP 246.39 billion, 
for Visayas PhP 71.49 billion and for Mindanao,PhP

Transmission Development
Table 51 (Annex A.1. 28) indicates that transmission 
projects require a total capital investment of PhP 20.58 
billion. Of this amount, about PhP 8.15 billion will be 
utilized for the Luzon grid, while PhP 4.27 billion and PhP 
8.16 billion are needed for the Visayas and Mindanao 
grids, respectively. The total investment will cover the 
expansion of sub-transmission lines, transmission projects 
associated with generating plants and other projects.
EXPANDED RURAL ELECTRIFICATION
The attainment of the government’s target of 
100 percent level barangay electrification by 2009 
would entail PhP 4.23 billion as indicated in Table 52 
(Annex A.1. 30). The electrification of the remaining 
2,054 unenergized barangays in the country will be 
implemented by the DOE and its partners coming from 
other line agencies, NGOs and private companies. 
Of the total investment required, the private sector 
has committed to provide PhP 2.10 billion and the 
remaining amount of about PhP 2.13 billion will be 
borne by the government. The energization of 892 
barangays in 2007 will require PhP 1.60 billion, and 
PhP 2.64 billion will be needed for the electrification 
of the remaining 1,162 unenergized barangays in the 
ensuing years of the planning horizon. 
DOWNSTREAM
The total investment requirement for the downstream 
sector stands at PhP 209.65 billion for the planning 
period (Please refer to Annex A.1.31).
Oil 
Based on the activities undertaken by the oil 
companies, it is projected that the total investment and retail marketing of petroleum products, alternative 
fuels and lubes.
Natural Gas
The PhP 199.26 billion investment in the natural 
gas industry is required for the establishment of the 
infrastructure and related facilities. Significant portion 
of the investment amounting to PhP 147.26 billion will 
be required in the construction of power plants while

their respective laws. R.A. 8479, otherwise known as 
Oil Industry Deregulation Law is included under this 
category.
Refining, Storage, Marketing and 
Distribution of Petroleum Products under R.A. 
8479
This covers activities under the downstream oil 
industry, specifically refining, storage, distribution and 
marketing of petroleum products.
1. Refinery refers to oil refining, oil processing and 
oil movements and storage within the refinery, 
defined as follows:
� Oil refining refers and covers the 
manufacturing of local petroleum products 
through distillation, conversion and treatment 
of crude oil and other naturally occurring 
petroleum hydrocarbons.
� Oil processing refers to and covers the activity 
of manufacturing local petroleum products 
with or without the use of the distillation 
process.
� Oil movement and storage cover receiving/
discharging and storing petroleum within the Investment Po
increase in existing volume of production, and/ or 
improvement in the quality of petroleum products 
in conformance with the PNS, the CAA, and other 
applicable laws and regulation.
 Investments in oil movement and storage shall 
include expansion, modification and modernization 
of facilities in the refinery resulting in an increase 
in existing capacity for storage, handling and 
distribution in the refinery.
2. Storage refers to the business of receiving/
discharging and storing petroleum crudes and/or 
products of others for compensation or profit.
3. Distribution refers to the bunkering and fuels 
shipping and transport. Fuels shipping and 
transport cover shipping and transport land such 
as tank trucks, lorries and pipeline and tankers, 
and barges for the fuels to get to the points or 
areas where they are needed. Bunkering covers 
the activity of selling fuel for direct use by a vessel, 
usually for water and air transport, through the use 
of a smaller transport vessel.
 Distribution projects are limited to those utilizing 
brand new equipment and double-hulled vessels.
4. Marketing covers the following:
� Retailing of petroleum products which refers to 
selling of petroleum products or fuels in retail 
generally directed to the end users, through 
dispensing pumps in gasoline stations or in 
packaged containers such as drums for the liquid 
fuels or metal cylinders for LPG. This includes the 
establishment and operation of gasoline stations 
and LPG retailing.
 For gasoline retailing stations, except those 
locating in Less Developed Areas (LDAs) listed 
in the IPP, the applicant shall be required to 
invest a minimum capital of PhP10 million 
per station, excluding land, or such amount as 
may be determined jointly by BOI and DOE 
for augmentation purposes, as the need arises. 
Provided, that foreign retailers shall comply with 
the requirements provided under R.A. 8762, 
otherwise known as the Retail Trade Liberalization 
Law, and its implementing rules and regulations.
� Fuels bulk marketing covers the selling of petroleum 
products or fuels in wholesale through tank trucks, 
lorries, double-hulled vessels / tankers, barges 
� LPG refilling and marketing which is a combination 
of storage, distribution, and marketing activities 
may also be eligible for registration. For storage, 
marketing and distribution, only investments of new 
industry participants may be entitled to incentives. 
The applicant shall submit an endorsement from 
the DOE certifying that the applicant is a new 
industry participant with new investments.
 Except for availment of incentive on duty of 3.0 
percent on imported capital equipment, a DOE 
certification on actual new investments of the 
registered enterprise shall be required in the 
application for incentives. Said investments shall be 
validated through an ocular inspection by the DOE.
 Incentives shall be available for a period of five 
years from the date of registration except ITH, 
which shall be reckoned from date of commercial 
operation. This date shall refer to the scheduled 
start of commercial operation as indicated in the 
firm’s specific registration terms and conditions 
based on the following:
� For refineries, it will be the date when the registered 
enterprise actually first began production of the

National Oil Company (PNOC) and its subsidiaries, National Power Corporation 
(NPC), National Electrification Administration (NEA), Power Sector Assets and :Liabilities 
Management (PSALM) Corporation, National Transmission Corporation (TransCo) 
and the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) through the Philippine Electricity 
Market Corporation (PEMC) gratefully acknowledge the various contributions from our 
partners in government and the private sector who collaborated with us in coming up 
with the 2007 Philippine Energy Plan Update. This Plan Update would not have been 
possible without the valuable inputs and support of our co-workers, and respected 
stakeholders from the energy circle as well as other concerned organizations. 
� We wish to particularly thank the National Economic and Development Authority, 
Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), National Statistics Office and the National Statistical 
Coordination Board (NSCB) for providing us the socio-economic planning parameters 
used in coming up with the energy demand forecasts. 
� We also acknowledge with appreciation the continuing support of the United States 
Agency for International Development-Energy and Clean Air Project and its academic 
network for providing us with the technical assistance in the conduct of the regional 
energy consultations in four key cities of the country, namely: the cities of Bacolod, 
General Santos, Laoag and Batangas. Similarly, we wish to thank the local government 
units of these respective cities for their significant contributions rendered during the 
consultations.
