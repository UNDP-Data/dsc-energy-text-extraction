The energy sector is important to Samoa’s economic, social, infrastructure and environmental 
composition. This plan has therefore been developed using extensive consultation with many 
groups. 
The purpose of the Energy Sector Plan is to provide a comprehensive plan for the energy 
sector to deliver outcomes consistent with the overarching Strategy for the Development of 
Samoa (SDS) 2012-2016, with due regard for cross-cutting issues including emphasising the 
importance of raising living standards, increasing resilience and boosting productivity for 
sustainable development. It provides a resourcing framework to support implementation of 
the plan.
The SDS 2012-2016 vision of “Improved Quality of Life for All” is supported by fourteen 
(14) key national outcomes within the four (4) broad sectors of economic, social, 
infrastructure and environment. 
All of these national outcomes are influenced by the availability, affordability, safety and 
environmental impacts of energy. Total demand for energy has grown substantially over 
recent decades, principally driven by increased demand for fossil fuelled vehicles and 
electrical appliances. This increase in demand has mainly been met by increased importation 
of petroleum products for transportation, electricity generation and to a lesser extent cooking. 
The increase in energy demand was accompanied by a gradual shift from indigenous energy 
sources such as biomass and hydropower to more convenient and readily accessible sources 
such as diesel, petrol, liquid petroleum gas (LPG) and kerosene. There is an abundance of 
biomass available as well as other forms of renewable energy, hence energy diversification 
based on indigenous energy sources is being encouraged and promoted for electricity 
generation immediately and for transportation in the future as it becomes economical. 
The Government publishes annual energy review reports, which provide an overview of 
Samoa’s energy sector including indigenous energy sources. These reports are intended to 
provide the Government of Samoa, business and the community with a better understanding 
of the energy sector. It is crucial that the data that informs these reports is accurate and 
provided in a timely manner. The adage that “you manage what you measure” is so important 
in this context. 
Energy used in Samoa is derived from three main sources – petroleum products, biomass and 
hydropower. Due to the high and growing proportion of petroleum products, the renewable 
energy component of Samoa’s energy sources has reduced from 25% to less than 20% since 
2000. 
The Samoan energy sector has been categorised into the following three sub-sectors in this 
plan because of their distinctive and contrasting characteristics: 
 Transport (~54% of total primary energy) comprises the land vehicles and 
domestic shipping fleets1
 powered by imported petroleum fuels (petrol, diesel) and 
currently a minute fraction of biodiesel; hence this sub-sector includes essentially no 
renewable energy at this time; 
 Electricity (~27% of total primary energy) is currently sourced from hydro and 
diesel generation with a very small solar component, and delivered for residential, 
commercial, institutional and industrial users. The renewable proportion of this subsector energy sources is estimated at 13% for 2011 (lower than the trend estimate of 
16% due to well below average rainfall in 2011); and (firewood, charcoal) with lesser amounts of LPG (gas), kerosene and a very small 
solar water heating component, with the renewable energy portion currently 
estimated at 86%. 
Samoa’s total energy supply and demand is simply depicted in the following diagram and 
presented in greater detail in Section 3.4 Samoa Energy Flow Chart. The scale of the blue 
arrows is indicative of energy flows in 2011: 
Figure 1: Samoa’s Total Energy Supply and Demand 
This Energy Sector Plan drives towards the Aspirational goals in green above. 
For the Energy Sector Plan period of 2012 to 2016 the key strategies and targeted outcomes 
for the sector as a whole and for Transport, Electricity and Heating are set out in the Energy 
Sector Logical Framework in Appendix 2.

In the early to mid 2000’s Samoa experienced high levels of economic and social 
development driven primarily by its Infrastructure and Commerce Industries. However, the 
Global Economic Crisis of 2008/09 revealed the country’s vulnerability to exogenous factors 
as fuel and food price increases were seen to have large detrimental effects on the local 
economy. Real GDP growth for 2008/09 was recorded at -5.1% whilst inflation skyrocketed 
to 13.9% pushed up by imported inflation. Although import cover was within the 4 – 6 
month fiscal target (at 5month) for the year mentioned, total imports illustrates an average 
increase of around 8% per annum for the past 4 years since the Global Economic Crisis. Of 
total imports, about 21% are petroleum products and according to the Central Bank of Samoa, 
percentage change in the value of petroleum imports from the 4Q11/12 over 4Q10/11 was an 
approximate 30% increase. 
In light of this heavy reliance, the Government of Samoa is committed to reducing this 
through raising the country’s energy self sufficiency through the promotion of RE 
investment, Energy Efficiency and Conservation. 
The Energy Sector Plan outlines the strategic directions and sets of targets that the Energy 
Sector in collaboration with its key stakeholders, intend to achieve within the period 2012 – 
2016 and is closely linked to the priority areas of the Strategy for the Development of Samoa 
2012 – 2016. 
The SDS 2012 - 2016 sets the National Development Goals, with the Energy Sector Plan 
interacting strongly with all other sectors, as set out in the diagram below. All other sectors 
are dependent on the energy sector for reliable, dependable, safe, high quality, 
environmentally sound and cost effective delivery of energy.

The national planning framework is now set over a four year period of realistic resource 
projections. Accordingly, the Energy Sector Plan is for the years 2012 – 2016 and it includes 
key outputs and performance measures, including measurable indicators as well as 
mechanisms for annual sector reviews that are linked to the budget process. 
1.2 Methodology 
The Energy Sector Plan has been compiled through a highly consultative process as well as 
reviews of existing literatures as a result of past research and studies for the Energy Sector. below. 
Figure 3: Conceptual Framework 
1.3 Purpose of this Plan 
The purpose of the Energy Sector Plan is to provide a comprehensive plan for the energy 
sector to deliver outcomes consistent with the overarching SDS 2012 - 2016, with due regard 
for cross-cutting areas such as emphasising the importance of raising living standards. It 
provides a resourcing framework to support implementation of the plan. The Plan also 
reviews existing institutional and monitoring arrangements with the aim of improving 
coordination, management and implementation of the plan. 2.1 Energy and the Economy 
The Strategy for the Development of Samoa (SDS) 2012–2016 details the Government’s 
commitment to enhancing people’s choices with its theme “Boosting productivity for 
Sustainable Development” and the vision continuing to be the longer term goal of “Improved 
Quality of Life for All”. 
The SDS 2012-2016 is supported by fourteen (14) key national outcomes within four (4) 
broad sectors: 
Priority Area 1: Economic Sector 
 Key Outcome 1: Macroeconomic Stability
 Key Outcome 2: Re-invigorate Agriculture 
 Key Outcome 3: Revitalised Exports 
 Key Outcome 4: Sustainable Tourism 
 Key Outcome 5: Enabling Environment for Business Development 
Priority Area 2: Social Policies 
 Key Outcome 6: A Healthy Samoa 
 Key Outcome 7: Improved Focus on Access to Education, Training and Learning Outcome 
 Key Outcome 8: Social Cohesion 
Priority Area 3: Infrastructure Sector 
 Key Outcome 9: Sustainable Access to Safe Drinking Water and Basic Sanitation 
 Key Outcome 10: Efficient, Safe and Sustainable Transport System and Networks 
 Key Outcome 11: Universal Access to Reliable and Affordable ICT Services 
 Key Outcome 12: Sustainability Energy Supply 
 Priority Area 4: Environment Sector 
 Key Outcome 13: Environment Sustainability 
 Key Outcome 14: Climate and Disaster Resilience 
All of the priority areas are influenced by the availability, affordability, safety and 
environmental impacts of energy. Total demand for energy has grown over the last 20 years 
along with a preference for electricity and fossil fuelled equipment and appliances. This 
increase in demand is mainly in petroleum products for transportation, electricity generation 
and to a lesser extent cooking. Essentially, there has been a gradual shift from indigenous 
energy sources such as biomass to more convenient sources such as petroleum and liquid 
petroleum gas (LPG). Between 1981 and 2001, the percentage of household cooking with 
wood dropped from 73% to 62% of households in Samoa2
 a trend expected to continue when 
this year’s census results are released. There is an abundance of biomass available as well as 
other forms of energy, hence energy diversification based on indigenous energy sources will 
be encouraged and promoted in a more sustainable manner. 
Fuel imports by both government and the private sector continue to increase. In Samoa’s First 
National Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention in 1999, it specifies 
that in spite of Samoa’s relatively small greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, there were parallel 
increasing trends in each of the greenhouse gases examined. These trends will continue if 
they were not addressed properly and promptly. A priority list of technology transfer is also 
provided in that document and energy interventions compose 50% of these. Samoa’s World 
Summit on Sustainable Development Assessment Report in 2002 also emphasised the 
promotion of viable renewable energy as one of the key priorities to be addressed in the 
energy sector. to meeting the increased demand. Energy efficiency and conservation plus demand side 
management are available to encourage end users to use energy wisely and efficiently 
resulting in energy savings. These measures will contribute to sustainable energy 
development improving quality of life for all by minimising environmentally adverse effects 
and maximising benefits. Sustainable development in its narrowest form will always be 
associated with efficient and reliable supporting services, such as electricity, transportation, 
communication and other services. 
Energy suppliers and distributors currently active in Samoa are Electric Power Corporation 
(EPC), Petroleum Products Supply (PPS), BOC Samoa 
and Origin Energy. EPC is a Government-owned 
corporation and the main producer and supplier of 
electricity in Samoa. Under contract to the Samoan 
Government, PPS receives and distributes petroleum 
products throughout Samoa, the products largely being 
purchased directly by the government under a Request 
for Proposal tendering process every 5 years. Mobil 
Oil Ltd won the first tender and supplied petroleum 
products to Samoa from 1998 to 2003, followed by 
Shell and now Exxon-Mobil. The Government sets and monitors fuel prices every month 
based on international fuel prices, the application of excise and other taxes, plus a 
distributor’s and retailer’s margin. 
The transport sector is a critical part of the national economy, underpinning a myriad of other 
industries and reflecting directly upon the value of everyday activity in terms of time and 
access. 
Electricity availability, reliability and price are important to the economic well-being of 
existing consumers and can potentially attract new industry and commercial development. 
2.2 Primary Energy Sources 
Samoa has undergone a transformation towards a 
society relying on commercial energy supply based 
on imported petroleum products, driven primarily by 
increasing demand for road vehicles and electrical 
appliances. Total energy demand for Samoa is met by 
3 main sources, petroleum products (diesel, petrol, 
kerosene and LPG), biomass and hydropower. 
Currently approximately 80% of the total energy used is derived from petroleum products, 
17% from biomass and 3% from hydropower. The contribution of solar energy to Samoa’s 
current energy mix is extremely small with rapidly increasing uptake.3 
The following graph shows the various sources of energy in Samoa between 2000 and 2011. 
Public Transport in Samoa 
Solar water heating  Source: Energy Database, Energy Policy Coordination and Management Division, Ministry of Finance 
Petrol and diesel are used in transport, diesel and hydro are used in electricity generation, and 
biomass, LPG and kerosene are use in heating, predominantly cooking. 
New information can be expected shortly with results of the 2011 Census, but the 2001 
Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) indicated that 91% of all households used 
electricity for lighting compared to less than 9% using kerosene. In contrast, only 3% used 
electricity for cooking and most of these households are in Apia. Biomass was the 
dominating cooking fuel, especially in rural areas with 74% of all households cooking with 
biomass compared to only 37% of Apia households. Around 9% of all households used LPG 
for cooking which was cheaper than electricity and easier to use than biomass. 
Renewable energy sources, currently estimated at 20% of Samoa’s total energy market are 
comprised of biomass (firewood) for cooking, hydro, which constitutes approximately 13% 
of the energy required for generation of electricity4, and a very small but expanding solar 
energy component. 
The resultant renewable energy content of Samoa’s total energy since 2000 is shown in the 
graph below. It is notable that the renewable share is low and diminishing as the nonrenewable component grows.

 The energy required for electricity generation reflects the conversion efficiencies of the technology used. For The Samoan energy sector is most easily analysed by segregating the sector into three subsectors, of transport, electricity and heating. This classification ensures a relatively limited 
mix of energy sources by sub-sector, with: 
 Transport (54% of total primary energy) comprising of petrol and diesel not used 
for electricity (with a very small biofuels component), and essentially 0% renewable 
energy; 
 Electricity (27% of total primary energy) comprising of non-transport diesel, all 
hydro and a very small solar component, with renewable energy sources for the subsector estimated at 13% of total but declining; and 
 Heating (19% of total primary energy) comprising predominantly biomass 
(firewood) with lesser amounts of LPG, kerosene and a very small solar water 
heating component, with renewable energy for the sub-sector estimated at 86%. 
The split of Samoa’s energy since 2000 by sub-sector is given in the graph below. The high 
proportion of transport fuels is apparent.

The aspirational goal for Samoa’s energy future, subject to economic, social and 
environmental constraints, is to substantially reduce energy imports (top entry), maximise 
idi(lft idt)d iiil(bttit) thbThe important cross-cutting issues to be considered when formulating policy for each Subsector are: 
1. Hardship; 
2. Climate Change; 
3. Human and Institutional Capacity; 
4. Promotion and Dissemination of Information; and 
5. Resilience 
These are addressed where appropriate throughout this Plan. This section explains each of the 
cross-cutting issues in greater detail. 
Hardship 
In general, Samoa has performed well in terms of human development. However there have 
been concerns expressed over inequality in income distribution, hardship amongst vulnerable 
groups, and the lack of formal employment and income generating opportunities (especially 
for school leavers). 
Based on a recent Poverty Report developed by the Samoa Bureau of Statistics with United 
Nations Development Program assistance in 2010, the analysis of hardship and poverty in 
Samoa used 2008 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) data to estimate food 
and Basic Needs Poverty Lines (BNPL). In terms of food and BNPL, the per capita costs 
have been estimated as a national average household expenditure of SAT$53.60 per capita 
per week with the Apia Urban Area having the highest at SAT$60.00, and the Rest of Upolu 
having the lowest at SAT$49.50. 
The level of serious poverty, as measured by the proportion of households in the population 
falling below the food poverty line is very low; only about 3% of households and 5% of the 
population. The average incidence of basic needs poverty among all households nationally is 
estimated at 20% accounting for 27% of the population. Within this national average, Savai’i 
had the highest proportion of the population (29%), followed by north-west Upolu (27%) and 
Rest of Upolu (27%) as shown in the following graph.

The increase in basic needs poverty that is seen is concentrated in the rural areas. The current 
policies and actions targeting these areas will need to take into consideration the ability and 
willingness of customers to pay for service delivery and other initiatives included in the Plan. 
ClChclimate change factors have had major effects on the sector in Apia and the rural areas. Dry 
and drought periods have resulted in water shortages and rationing, whilst heavy rains have 
bought the problems of flooding and sedimentation which affect the water quality and 
quantity of clean water available. 
Samoa has faced the challenge of a long dry period (drought) from May to October 2011, 
which resulted in serious water shortages in western Savai’i and southeast Upolu. 
Conversely, in areas where there is a good amount of rainfall, the clearance of trees and 
development in watershed areas will also require close monitoring in coming years to ensure 
protection of the resource. 
All of EPC’s hydro schemes have been affected with hydro inflows substantially down in the 
past year and gradual deterioration in the utilisation factor of hydro facilities caused in part 
by deforestation. Sea level rise and increased rainfall also need to be taken into consideration 
for all new energy facilities and may also influence the management of existing assets. 
Samoa has a “Carbon Neutral by 2020” goal approved by Cabinet in 2010, and there is 
consideration being given to a carbon neutral energy sector and a NAMA (Nationally 
Appropriate Mitigation Actions) in the energy sector emerging from Samoa’s participation as 
a member of the Cartagena Dialogue in 2011. These initiatives are currently not well 
developed, but this Energy Sector Plan is strongly aligned with the general intent, 
encouraging uptake of renewables, increased distributed sources of energy and increased 
community involvement in the sector. A watching brief and potential involvement as these 
evolve is important to the sector. 
For the energy sector climate change mitigation and adaptation forms part of overall sector 
resilience as discussed further below. 
Human and Institutional Capacity 
Human and institutional capacity building is an important part of further developing and 
strengthening the energy sector in Samoa. Lead agencies for each of the sub-sectors are 
responsible for identifying any resource and capacity building requirements and looking to 
resolve these. 
The Energy Policy Coordination and Management Division, as Energy Sector Co-ordinator, 
should also be informed and where appropriate may be able to facilitate the shifting of 
resources across government and possibly with the private sector. At the very least, shortfalls 
need to be raised at the sector level and included in sector wide resource development. 
Promotion and Dissemination of Information
The Government recognises the importance of disseminating information related to all subsectors of the energy sector, in particular promoting public awareness of energy efficiency 
and conservation, information on vehicle and appliance energy consumption ratings, 
promoting energy audits and demonstrating ways to minimise electricity usage. These efforts 
need to be implemented in all three sub-sectors in order to culminate in greater consumer 
awareness on cost saving measures in terms of household and business energy usage and 
demand side management. Better coordination of transport data collection will also contribute 
greatly to public awareness and improve information on energy demand and supply for 
dissemination. Resilience is a very important part of energy sector management and operations. Resilience 
encompasses most of the cross-cutting issues and also recognises that the sector is part of the 
overall infrastructure sector with common characteristics including significant capital 
invested, long-life assets, and technology based systems delivering service to consumers. 
Increasing levels of resilience can be achieved by having redundancy and diversity, but this is 
only one consideration. It is not always necessary to aim for high levels of resilience 
throughout an energy system, a good example being the use of fuses in electrical networks 
and in homes. By introducing a point of weakness (the fuse), any overload can be controlled 
and remedial measures can be simple and immediate by replacing the fuse. Pressure valves in 
gas systems are another example. 
As the word resilience can be a little vague and everyone has a different understanding of 
what it refers to, it is useful to establish a common understanding as it applies to Samoa’s 
energy sector and indeed to the infrastructure sector as a whole (which also includes 
transport, water, and telecommunications). 
At the highest level: 
“Resilience - National Infrastructure is able to deal with significant disruption 
and changing circumstances.” 
The resilience of infrastructure involves users as well as network providers, management as 
well as operators, and funding agencies as well as insurers. It includes risk management in 
advance as well as ability to respond to evolving events over time (rising sea levels, changing 
demographics) or shock events (flooding, global oil supply restrictions). 
For the energy sector resilience embodies the following attributes: 
 Attribute (1) – Service Delivery 
There is a focus on national, business and community needs in the immediate and longer 
term. 
 Attribute (2) – Adaptation 
Energy infrastructure has the capacity to withstand disruption, absorb disturbance, act 
effectively in a crisis, and recognises changing conditions over time (eg. climate change). 
 Attribute (3) – Community Preparedness 
Infrastructure users and providers understand the outage risks they face and take steps to 
mitigate these. Aspects of timing, duration, regularity, intensity, and impact tolerance differ 
over time and between communities. 
 Attribute (4) – Responsibility 
Individual and collaborative responsibilities are clear between owners, operators, users, 
policy-makers and regulators. Responsibility gaps are addressed. 
 Attribute (5) – Interdependencies 
A systems approach applies to identification and management of risk (including 
consideration of interdependencies, supply chain and weakest link vulnerabilities). 
 Attribute (6) – Financial Strength 
There is financial capacity to deal with investment, significant disruption and changing 
circumstances. This includes; available funds, the awareness of financiers and insurers, 
continuing capital investment and maintenance expenditure. 
 Attribute (7) – Continuous 
On-going resilience activities provide assurance and draws attention to emerging issues, 
recognising that infrastructure resilience will always be a work in progress. 
 Attribute (8) – Organisational Performance These attributes of resilience can be applied at the household, the community, the business 
and the national level with all potentially having a different perspective on the desired levels 
of resilience. Additional effort is required by all energy stakeholders in Samoa to improve 
understanding of current levels of resilience and where further effort should be applied. 
This sector plan begins addressing some of these for example through reducing dependence 
on imported fuels and encouraging more distributed electricity generation. 
2.6 Retail Energy Prices 
Retail prices (inclusive of Value Added Goods and Services Tax - VAGST) for the various 
forms of energy since 2000 are shown in the graph below. LPG prices are currently 
unavailable for earlier years. The firewood price relates to market prices in Apia. Most 
firewood sourced in rural areas is collected locally by the end user at no monetary cost to the 
consumer.

2.7 Governance, Policy and Regulatory Framework 
The energy sector governance, policy and regulatory settings contribute strongly to a focused 
and productive sector oriented towards national goals. These 3 topics are covered 
individually below. 
2.7.1 Governance 
The National Energy Coordination Committee is the key decision making body for the 
Samoan energy sector. It comprises representatives from all key government ministries and 
agencies that have input into the sector. 
National Energy Coordination Committee 
The National Energy Co-ordination Committee (NECC5
) was established in 2010 in 
recognition of the somewhat dispersed nature of decision making in the energy sector, and the 
need to achieve a co-ordinated pragmatic approach recognising the substantial importance of 
the energy sector to the future of Samoa. 
The objectives of the NECC are: 
 Advocating for energy as an essential enabling tool for realising the national 
development goals as well as to support the sustainable development issues; 
 Promoting the mainstreaming of energy into all sectors and decision-making 
processes at all levels of government and society, including national planning and 
budgetary processes; 
                                                      
5 Central Apia
energy with clear policies, plans and legislations, accountable institutional and 
organisational arrangements, which are inter-linking all the various levels of 
government, sectors and communities; 
 Promoting evidence and knowledge based 
decision-making, reflecting a shift away from the 
traditional ad hoc practices; and 
 Creating an environment for sustained, 
coordinated and harmonised support from regional 
entities, international organisations and 
development partners. 
Importantly, the NECC is concerned with the entire energy sector. To undertake its role, the 
NECC needs overall awareness of the sector, and the ability to review and endorse any 
activities whether in the private or government sector, with or without government or aid 
funding. It is a clearing house for initiatives and activities that warrant government 
endorsement The Energy Policy Coordination and Management Division of the Ministry of 
Finance acts as the Secretariat for the NECC. 
2.7.2 Policy Framework 
There are a number of key policy documents relevant to the Energy Sector Plan, the most 
important of which is the overarching Strategy for the Development of Samoa 2012 – 2016. 
Strategy for the Development of Samoa (SDS) 2012 - 2016 
The SDS 2012 – 2016 presents Samoa’s development vision, its medium-terms national 
development goals, and the strategies to be implemented during four financial years 2012 – 
2016 in order to achieve those goals. The SDS 2012 – 2016 framework is considered an 
appropriate basis for the development of the Energy Sector Plan. 
Samoan National Energy Policy (SNEP) 2007 and its Strategic Action Plan (SAP) 2008 
(Both superceded by this Energy Sector Plan) 
The Samoan National Energy Policy (SNEP) 2007, and its associated Strategic Action Plan 
(SAP) 2008, constituted the first energy sector policy aimed at providing a clear direction for 
all energy developments in Samoa. This Energy Sector Plan takes the opportunity to 
consolidate the SNEP 2007 and SAP 2008 into one document, targeting the strategic areas of: 
Transport, Electricity, and Heating, and embedding renewable energy and energy efficiency 
throughout. 
National Infrastructure Strategic Plan 2011-2021 
The National Infrastructure Strategic Plan (NISP) 2008 – 2018 outlines the Government’s 
priorities and strategic directions for major initiatives in the economic infrastructure over the 
next 5 – 10 years. The NISP is closely linked to the SDS 2012 - 2016 and its vision of 
“boosting productivity for sustainable development”, in that it recognises that there is a 
“clear and positive link between infrastructure, social development, community wellbeing 
and economic growth.” 
The four main initiatives identified in the Energy section of the NISP are: the Power Sector 
Expansion Project; a demand-side strategy; the development of clean energy resources 
through the establishment of a local Clean Energy Fund; the establishment of Samoa under 
the global Clean Development Mechanism; and other renewable energy generation including 
large on-grid solar. National Policy of Combating Climate Change 2007, and Greenhouse Gas Abatement 
Strategy 2008 – 2018 
Both documents refer to greenhouse gas mitigation strategies and objectives that involve 
energy, including renewable energy and energy efficiency. It is important that these policies 
are taken into account and considered when formulation and implementing the Energy Sector 
Plan. 
Towards an Energy Secure Pacific: A Framework for Action on Energy Security in the 
Pacific 2010 
Regional initiatives and interventions are mentioned as a way of supplementing, enhancing 
and adding value to national capacity. There may be ways that these and any other regional 
programs and initiatives such as the Pacific Regional Environment Programme Strategic Plan 
2011 – 2015, can assist Samoa with the implementation of its Energy Sector Plan. 
Water & Sanitation Sector Plan 2012 - 2016 
Water is one of the priority sectors in Samoa, as it directly impacts on the quality of life and 
the overall productivity of the population. A “sector wide planning approach to planning 
(SWAP) has been embraced by both government and the water sector development partners
for resources mobilisation and implementation of sector plan”. The main objective of the 
draft 2012 – 2016 water sector plan is to focus on implementation of key reforms and policies 
over the 2012 – 2016 timeframe. 
Energy is also a utility that cuts across many other sectors, so the water sector governance, 
institutional arrangements and programmes are useful considerations for the Energy Sector 
Planning process. 
2.7.3 Regulatory Framework 
The key Samoan Acts and Regulations applicable to the energy sector are as follows: 
1. The Electric Power Corporation Act 1980; 
2. The Electricity Act 2010; 
3. The Petroleum Act 1984; 
4. The Planning and Urban Management Act 2004; and 
5. The Land Transport Authority Act 2007. 
Relevant considerations in relation to each Act, for the purpose of the Samoan Energy Sector 
Plan, are set out below. 
The Electric Power Corporation Act 1980 
The purpose of this Act is to consolidate and amend certain enactments relating to the 
Electric Power Corporation, its functions, operations and other related matters including its 
role in the generation, supply and use of electricity. 
The Electricity Act 2010 
The purpose of this Act is to provide for a new legislative framework for regulating the 
electricity sector, the establishment of the post of the Electricity Regulator at the Office of the 
Regulator, and for related matters. It also enables the setting of tariffs and the licensing of 
new electricity generators or operators of independent electricity networks. The Petroleum Act 1984 
The purpose of this Act is to make provision for the supply, transport and storage of 
petroleum. Most significantly, this Act is now quite dated and makes no provision for the 
import, production, sale and use of biofuels. The New Zealand Engine Fuel Specifications 
Regulations 2011 and the Australian Fuel Quality Standards Regulations 2001 provide useful 
examples for considering how any fuel oil specification regulations could look in Samoa. 
The Planning and Urban Management Act 2004 
The purpose of this Act is to establish a Planning and Urban Management Agency and to 
implement a framework for planning the use, development, management and protection of 
land in Samoa for the present and long-term interests of all Samoans and for related purposes. 
There appear to be no particular restrictions on the development of renewables and other 
energy sector initiatives other than those that apply generally to developments. 
Land Transport Authority Act 2007 
This Act outlines the Authority’s functions, which involves undertaking necessary planning, 
design, supervision, construction and maintenance of national roads and land, as well as 
transport infrastructure throughout Samoa. 
2.8 Key Stakeholders
Broadly speaking, all suppliers and consumers of energy products and services in Samoa are 
stakeholders, covering industries, communities, businesses and institutions. 
For the purposes of this plan, the following are 
the key implementing agencies of the Energy 
Sector whilst Appendix 3 provides a 
Responsibility Matrix highlighting their key roles 
in the implementation of the Energy Sector Plan: 
Ministry of Finance, Energy Policy Coordination 
and Management Division (EPCMD) 
Formerly a unit within the Economic Policy and 
Planning Division of the Ministry of Finance, the Energy Policy Coordination and 
Management Division (EPCMD) was set up as part of the Public Finance Management 
Reform Program Phase II. The EPCMD is tasked with overseeing the analysis of petroleum 
prices on a monthly basis as well as the compilation of annual energy reviews to inform 
policy decision making. The EPCMD is also the technical arm for the National Energy 
Coordination Committee (NECC) as well as the Designated National Authority (DNA). 
Electricity Regulator, Office of the Regulator (ER-OOTR) 
This is a newly established division, set up as a consequence of Cabinet’s decision to open up 
the electricity sector to Independent Power Producers (IPP’s) and in light of the need to 
regulate electricity tariffs to not only benefit all producers but to also protect consumers from 
high electricity prices. 
 
Ministry of Natural Resources & Environment (MNRE) 
The Ministry of Natural Resource houses the Renewable Energy (RE) Division who is tasked 
with undertaking feasibility studies and research into RE sources for Samoa whilst ensuring 
that environmental sustainability is maintained. 
Meeting of the NECC The EPC is currently the sole provider of electricity for the country and provides insight into 
the pricing and costing of electricity generation and distribution. Furthermore, EPC currently 
establishes and maintains all infrastructures for both electricity generation and distribution. 
In addition to this role, the EPC also houses projects for the testing and piloting of RE 
technologies that feed into the country’s grid. 
Land Transport Authority (LTA) 
The LTA is the lead agency for energy efficiency within the transport sector through 
regulation and enforcement. Their key role is to ensure the enforcement of tiered 
registrations for vehicles based on engine size as well as the enforcement of fines on transport 
practices that are not energy efficient which contributes to reduction in fuel consumption and 
GHG emissions. 
Scientific Research Organisation of Samoa (SROS) 
In addition to efforts implemented by the MNRE, the SROS also conducts and pilots RE 
technologies to test their feasibility given Samoa’s context. Since 2008, SROS has 
researched, developed and successfully piloted the use of biodiesel and currently have a total 
of 8 vehicles running using the RE source. 
Ministry for Revenue (MfR) 
The Customs Department for the Ministry for Revenue at the Apia Wharf plays a key role in 
the regulating of tariffs on imported vehicles as well as the recording of data on the number 
of vehicles as well as their engine sizes upon arrival at the Apia Port. 
Ministry of Women, Community and Social Development (MWCSD) 
The MWCSD plays a key role as mediator between all the line agencies mentioned above and 
the communities. They will be key in ensuring that ownership is developed at the community 
level when RE and EE projects are established at this level. 
Others 
Other stakeholders with roles in implementing the Energy Sector Plan include the Samoa 
Bureau of Statistics, Petroleum Products Suppliers and Private Sector in terms of data 
collection, information dissemination as well as monitoring of all key Energy policy areas. 3.1 Energy Sector Vision 
The vision for the Energy Sector is derived from the Strategy for the Development of Samoa 
2012 – 2016 (SDS): 
Sustainable Energy 
The Energy Sector Plan 2012 – 2016 is guided by the theme of: 
Sustainable Energy Supply- towards Energy Self Sufficiency 
This theme highlights the Government of Samoa’s commitment to reducing reliance on 
imported fuels and to the promotion of research, development and use of alternative RE 
sources. 
3.2 National Development Strategic Areas 
As stipulated within the SDS, the national development strategies for the Energy Sector are 
as follows: 
3.3 Energy Sector Overarching Objective and High Level Indicators 
Adapted from the vision and the national development strategies, the overall objective and 
high level indicators for the Energy Sector are as follows: 
Overall Sector Goal/Objective: 
To reduce the growth rate in the volume of imported fossil fuels by 10% by 2016 
The high level indicators for this overarching goal/objective are: 
i. Energy Sector Plan launched and implemented with at least 75% of targets achieved 
by 2016; 
ii. Increase in the contribution of RE to total energy consumption by 10% by 2016; 
iii. Increase in the supply of RE for energy services by 10% by 2016; 
3.4 Key Sector Policy Outcomes 
Due to its wide scope and crosscutting nature, the Energy Sector Plan has been divided into 
four key policy areas under the following key outcomes: 
1) Institutional Framework 
Efficient and effective coordination and management of the Energy Sector; 
2) Transport 
Efficient, sustainable, safe and cost effective energy use in the transport sector; 
3) Electricity 
Efficientreliablesafeaffordable and sustainable electricity services; 
Strategic Areas 
 Promote and increase renewable energy investment and generation; 
 Efficient, affordable and reliable electricity supply; 
 Effective management of petroleum supply; 
 Promote energy efficiency practices in all sectors particularly the transport sector; and 
 Efficient and effective coordination and management of the sector through the implementation of the 
energy sector plan.Growth in energy demand is expected to continue into the future consistent with the SDS 
2012 – 2016 Strategic Areas. The increasing consumption of petroleum fuels poses concerns 
in terms of environmental impacts not only in terms of emissions but also from poor handling 
and management of fuel and lubricants. The unloading and storage of petroleum products as 
well as handling and storage of waste oil and other petroleum by-products needs to be 
managed properly. Energy efficiency and conservation measures are not actively pursued and 
should be encouraged as immediate savings are anticipated. This would minimise the strain in 
meeting energy demand as well as reducing the negative environmental impacts and other 
adverse effects. Due to the increasing fuel prices and Samoa’s heavy reliance on fossil fuel to 
meet its demand, renewable energy, indigenous energy sources and energy efficiency are 
promoted and encouraged. Key Policy

1.11Promote energy efficiency in each of the three sub-sectors 
4.1 Strategic Direction 2012-2016 
The activities within this component primarily focus on increased governance, leadership and 
co-ordination across the energy sector plus a number of aspects that encompass all of the subsectors such as raising public awareness and energy efficiency initiatives which drive from 
the consumer end of the system. Importantly, the public should be well informed of the 
potential negative impacts of fossil fuel on the environment, the cost benefits available from 
energy efficiency across the sector and the move to more renewable energy. These activities 
along with their performance targets are outline in the Energy Sector Logical Framework set 
out in Appendix 2. 
Energy Data 
The Government publishes annual energy review reports, which provide an overview of 
Samoa’s energy sector and are intended to provide the Government of Samoa, business and 
the community with a better understanding of the energy sector. It is crucial that the data that 
informs these reports is accurate and provided in a timely manner so that positive advances 
can be quickly recognised and quick responses are made where divergence from the Energy 
Sector Plan occurs. 
Expressions of Interest Approach6
A key aspect of this Plan is the need to immediately establish a more robust process to 
confirm the relative merits of energy proposals which reduce the dependence on imported 
petroleum products by substituting for diesel fuelled electricity generation and provide 
locally sourced biofuels, subject to economic viability. The recommended mechanism to 
achieve this is to seek “Expressions of Interest” from experienced interested parties. This 
clearly needs to be undertaken in the context of what opportunities actually exist at this time. 
For transport fuel substitutes, it needs to be recognised that the existing transport fleet will be 
slow to change and can only tolerate certain levels of fuel substitution. 
 
A significant opportunity exists to progressively establish a commercial biofuel industry, 
based on existing proven technologies possibly coupled with existing commercial operations 
in other countries. Bio-diesel (from coconut and from other lower value oil-based crops) and 
bio-alcohols (ethanol and perhaps methanol) from viable source crops are likely to be 
dominant candidates for commercial establishment based on international experience. An 
“Expressions of Interest” approach will result in a range of projects that can be assessed respect to criteria established in the Energy Sector Plan, rather than one-off assessments of 
proposals that are currently received on an ad-hoc basis. 
Accordingly, it is considered essential that, consistent with the direction of the SDS 2012-
2016, the Government of Samoa move from a reactive stance (receiver of proposals on an adhoc basis) to a proactive stance (seeker of proposals from experienced interested parties) to 
ensure focus on “boosting productivity for sustainable development”. The biofuels industry 
development opportunity is considered to rank highly as a major economic opportunity for 
Samoa provided that such industries can be proven to be commercially viable. 
A framework for assessing energy sector proposals is currently under development by the 
NECC. To this end, the assessment of proposals must be based on strict adherence to a 
process that complies with the direction of the Energy Sector Plan 2012 – 2016 (which in turn 
must comply with the direction of the SDS 2012 – 2016). This is likely to include: 
 All energy sector initiatives, including new policies, plans, investment and divestment 
proposals, across both the government and private sectors, that may impact on the 
Energy Sector come within the purview of the NECC; 
 Use of technology that is deemed technically and commercially viable; 
 The outcomes (production of liquid fuels, generation of electricity, etc) are consistent 
with the goals and targets of the Energy Sector Plan 2012 – 2016 (and hence the SDS 
2012 – 2016); 
 The initiative sponsor is assessed as being of good character and of sufficient financial 
strength to complete the proposed activity; 
 Where possible, all risks are the responsibility of the initiative sponsor/s and/or suppliers 
through long term supply agreements (where this is not possible, the Government of 
Samoa must not be required to bear unreasonable responsibility for risk); 
 The initiative is deemed economically viable based on thorough economic analysis 
(including meeting acceptable financial assessment criteria such as net present value, 
internal rate of return and sensitivity analyses for key variable costs and product prices); 
 Funding sources are either in place or under a “Heads of Agreement” framework; and 
 Maximum use is made of Samoan skills in project development and ongoing operations. 
Governance and Regulatory 
The current institutional frameworks for sector governance and sector co-ordination are 
considered appropriate for the scale of undertaking and the direction required for the sector. 
Strengthened endeavour and clarity of respective roles and responsibilities is required. 
Although the role of the Electricity Regulator has been extended to an Energy Regulator role, 
the fact that the energy sector is dominated by petroleum fuels with its price and delivery 
already entirely regulated by Government, call for the need to ensure that the roles and 
responsibility of the Regulator is clearly articulated. With respect to liquid petroleum gas 
(LPG) the presence of two suppliers ensures a level of competition, and essentially LPG 
needs to be price competitive with alternate sources such as electricity and biomass. 
Consideration will be given to the merits of developing a new Energy Act to mandate new 
efforts under the NECC including the terms and conditions for IPP’s, development of PPA’s 
as well as minor details which are not clearly mandated under existing legislations. 
Upgrading the Electric Power Corporation Act 1980 and the Petroleum Act 1984, as well as 
completing the electricity tariff setting regulations under the Electricity Act 2010, will be

5.1 Transport Sub-sector Definition 
For the purposes of this document, transport refers to the movement of people, goods and 
services, largely using motorised vehicles, local shipping and machinery, together with their 
fuels such as petrol and diesel (excluding diesel used for electricity generation), biofuels such 
as bioethanol, biobutanol and biodiesel and potentially electricity if used in future for motive 
energy applications. International aviation and international shipping are excluded as the 
energy is essentially used outside Samoa. 
5.2 Sub-sector Review 
This section incorporates a review of the Transport Sub-sector, its past performance, current 
status and its resultant potential opportunities, and its composition from energy supply and 
demand perspectives. 
Currently approximately 55% of energy used for transport is derived from petrol, with the 
balancing 45% derived from diesel. The following graph shows the component energy 
sources for the transport sub-sector from 2000-2011. 
Figure 12: Transport Sub-sector Energy Sources 2000-2011 
Source: Energy Policy Coordination and Management, Ministry of Finance 
Transport Overview 
Transportation is vital to the social and economic development of Samoa. Development in the 
transportation sector has direct links to the advancements in other sectors of the economy. It 
enables the movement of goods and services both domestically and abroad and increases 
access for non-urban dwellers to markets7
, employment opportunities and services such as 
education and health. 
While it is important to develop the transport sector 
together with other utilities8
, they are generally 
characterised by very costly projects to implement and 
maintain. However, there are major benefits in having an 
effective and energy efficient transportation sector, 
which flows into other sectors of the economy. A better 
planned and managed public transportation network will 
significantly improve efficiency in the Transport Subsector. 
 The Transport Sub-sector together with the Electricity Sub-sector consumes a major share of 
fossil fuel used in Samoa. Unlike electricity, almost all of the energy consumption in the 75% of total fossil fuel and was responsible for a substantial portion of greenhouse gas 
emissions and air pollutants. By 2005, the transport sector accounted for over 80% of total 
fossil fuel consumption. 
The increasing number of imported cars accounted for most of the increasing demand for 
fossil fuel. To assist in easing these pressures as well as promoting efficient vehicles, 
restrictions were imposed on vehicle importations based on model year. To further promote 
efficient vehicles, engine capacity is used both in determining if an import excise tax is also 
charged in calculating vehicle registration fees. For instance, vehicles above 2000 cc engines 
are required to pay an excise tax and car registration fees are levied against engine capacity. 
These measures have contributed to improving the efficiencies in land transport but there are 
other necessary initiatives that would promote renewable energy usage in the sector. The 
viability of using biodiesel derived from coconut oil to supplement fossil fuel is being 
explored especially with the abundance of coconuts available in Samoa. In addition, walking 
and cycling reduce the usage of vehicles and fossil fuel as well as having health benefits. 
Passive design features are also effective. Removal of speed bumps, use of electronic 
technology to manage vehicle speeds, reliance on roundabouts rather than traffic lights and 
easily maintained roads are some specific examples. 
Petroleum safety standards and regulations must be 
adhered to with regard to storage and refuelling of all 
transport modes. Development of alternative and 
sustainable modes of transport and upgrading vehicles 
to curb emissions is encouraged. Emphasis on 
disseminating information related to air pollution and 
promoting public awareness of the impact of transport 
on the environment through the media is also 
encouraged. 
Better coordination of transport data collection will contribute greatly to public awareness 
and improve energy demand and supply information for dissemination. 
Transport Fuels 
The Transport Sub-sector comprises petrol and diesel (excluding diesel used for electricity 
generation). These fuels, along with kerosene, are imported to Samoa under contract to the 
Samoa Government, with onshore management and distribution the current responsibility of 
Petroleum Product Supplies Limited (PPS), a private Samoan company. The international 
supplier is currently Exxon-Mobil with the multi-year contract due for retendering in 2014. 
The Government sets petrol, diesel and kerosene prices monthly based on a price formula 
which includes distribution and retail margins. 
PPS ensures the Government mandated security-of-supply stored volumes are equal to or 
exceed 10 days national demand. The products are supplied by tanker vessel and are pumped 
via single pipeline from the wharf facilities to the PPS managed facility. Tank capacities are 
currently approximately 6,340kl for diesel, 3,650kl for petrol, and 2,375kl for kerosene 
(including JetA1 which is transferred to the airport by road tanker). Diesel, petrol and 
kerosene are distributed by tanker (either PPS operated or sub-contractor owned) to the 
various major customers (eg EPC) or fuel station outlets. Additional storage capacity is in the 
Apia Wharf and fishing fleet are being used in fuel blends in some vehicles with no known adverse effects. However, the 
amount of biofuels used is extremely small compared to the mineral-derived diesel and petrol 
volumes used. There is considerable potential for expansion of biofuels production in Samoa, 
subject to economic constraints. 
Bioethanol from cassava and biodiesel from coconut oil are proven technologies. Biodiesel 
from coconut oil, however, is constrained by the high price of coconut oil compared to the 
price of mineral diesel on global markets. In addition, the cost of coconut oil and in turn 
biodiesel from coconut oil is highly sensitive to the cost per coconut, currently around 10-30 
sene per coconut. Nevertheless, subject to economic constraints, the opportunity to import 
bioethanol and blend at up to 15% (E15) with imported gasoline, ahead of local commercial 
bioethanol production, could be considered given the immediate positive impact such an 
approach would have on renewable energy levels. 
In the long run, subject to the transformation of Samoa’s electricity generation to renewable 
energy sources, the advent of electric cars holds considerable prospect for transforming 
Samoa’s transport fuels from non-renewable fossil fuels to largely renewable electricity. To 
this end, a roadmap for the introduction of electric cars needs to be considered. 
Petroleum Fuel Supply 
The rationalisation of supply and distribution of petroleum products, which was initiated in 
the early 1990s, and came into effect in 1998, has resulted in the government acquiring all 
storage facilities for petroleum products. A tendering process is carried out every 5 years to 
appoint an operator for the facilities to be responsible for the supply and distribution of 
petroleum products in accordance with the Petroleum Act 1984 and petroleum standards and 
regulations. This rationalisation exercise has resulted in Samoa being one of the countries in 
the region with the lowest fuel prices. Fuel prices are calculated and released on a monthly 
basis based on fluctuation in international market fuel prices and an agreed formula to cover 
other costs. Further refinement is needed to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness in 
monitoring, management and assessment of petroleum related matters such as pricing, 
security of supply, tendering process, quality and standards. 
In addition, the supply of fuel and gas to rural locations and outer islands is not always 
reliable and carried out in a safe manner. All these factors gave rise to the need to enhance 
and enforce the existing legislation. 
Informing the Public 
Above all, the public should be well informed of 
government initiatives in the petroleum sector and 
also about the potential negative impacts of fossil 
fuel on the environment and the move to renewable 
energy. Furthermore, public awareness programs 
need to be continued on energy efficiency and 
conservation including; appliance energy 
consumption ratings, promoting energy audits, and 
demonstrating ways to minimise electricity usage. 
These efforts will culminate in greater consumer awareness on cost saving measures in terms 
of household and business kilowatts usage and demand side management. 
Fuel outlet The regulatory framework for Transport as it relates to energy largely centres on the 
Petroleum Act 1984, the purpose of which is to make provision for the supply, transport and 
storage of petroleum, and the Land Transport Act 2007, which relate to the functioning of the 
Land Transport Authority (LTA). 
Petroleum Act 1984 
As currently worded the Petroleum Act 1984 defines ‘petroleum’ as “any gas, liquid, or solid 
compound, whether used as a fuel or for lubrication purposes, which is derived wholly or in 
part from the refining and blending of hydrocarbon compounds.” As such, the Act does not 
cover ethanol, biodiesel and glycerol. 
In order to enable new opportunities such as the ability to import, produce, use and sell 
ethanol, biodiesel and glycerol in Samoa, the Petroleum Act 1984 would need to be amended 
to broaden the definition to cover all fuel types. Moreover, amendments would need to cover 
issues around importing, producing, using and selling to determine the extent of private and 
Government rights with regard to fuel oils other than petroleum, which the Government 
already has substantial powers over. For example, any ethanol produced in Samoa is likely to 
be blended into petroleum in Samoa rather than sold in its pure form, so private rights could 
exist until point of sale for blending with petroleum in Samoa. 
Regarding petroleum safety, the petroleum sector is guided by the Petroleum Act 1984 in 
issuing petroleum licences for and maintenance of service stations. Petroleum safety 
standards and regulations for handling and storage of petroleum products are also used to 
ensure that the supplier is safely and reliably supplying and distributing petroleum products 
to different destinations including all service stations in the country and storage facilities are 
well maintained to avoid major damage to the environment. However, enforcement of this 
Act and related legislation is required to ensure that these products are handled safely in an 
environmentally sensitive manner. A number of human resource, technological and 
legislation needs should be addressed to ensure safety and environmental compatibility 
including the disposal of waste oil and the merits of using alternative fuel sources. 
Land Transport Authority Act 2007 
The Land Transport Authority Act 2007 outlines the Authority’s functions which involves 
undertaking “necessary planning, design, supervision, construction and maintenance of 
national roads and land transport infrastructure throughout Samoa”. 
Besides this Act, the Road Traffic Ordinance 1960 regulates the registration of vehicles and 
the Road Traffic Regulations 1961 regulate the emission of smoke and sparks from vehicles. 
Engine Fuel Specifications 
Regarding importing, using and selling ethanol, biodiesel or other bio-fuels and glycerol, 
regulations specifying quality standard requirements would be essential. The New Zealand 
Engine Fuel Specifications Regulations 2011 and the Australian Fuel Quality Standards 
Regulations 2001 provide useful examples for considering how any fuel oil specification 
regulations could look in Samoa. 
Liquid Fuels Pricing 
Liquid fuels pricing is a delicate balancing act globally with countries applying excise tax to 
achieve funding of infrastructure development and to initiate price based responses by 
consumers. The following graphs depict the primary components of the final delivered price 
fbth tl d dil iSprimarily due to volatility in the landed cost component. 
Figure 13: Liquid Fuel Costs 
Source: Energy Policy Coordination and Management Division, Ministry of Finance 
Important points to be made are that petrol and diesel price components are more or less the 
same, and that a significant portion of the delivered price (approximately SAT$1) is 
distribution, retailer and other charges. For any prospective fuel substitute such as a biofuel, 
comparison needs to be made with the basic Landed Cost of approximately SAT$2 per litre. 
When comparing petrol and diesel prices globally, Australia and New Zealand tend to be at 
the cheaper end of the spectrum (see the graph below). When comparing the delivered price 
in Samoa with these countries it is cheaper again, raising the prospect there may be some 
merit in reviewing the current level of excise tax in Samoa.

5.5 Key Stakeholders 
All key stakeholders have responsibilities to ensure all health and safety standards are 
adhered to and operational best practice is followed. As set out in the conceptual framework 
diagram in Section 2.2, the key agencies responsible for implementation of the Transport 
Sub-sector are the Ministry of Finance, the LTA, the Ministry of Works, Transport and 
Infrastructure (MWTI), the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment (MNRE), 
and the Scientific Research Organisation of Samoa (SROS). 
 
In particular, this Plan assigns increased responsibilities to the LTA with respect to 
implementing a range of initiatives related to the transport fleet, fuels used and transport 
network design, including public transport and cycle ways. 
The Ministry of Finance’s Energy Policy Coordination and Management Division has 
responsibility for the continued ownership of petroleum facilities together with the 
procurement and distribution of liquid fuels. Currently Exxon-Mobil and PPS are the key 
khldfld diibiPif l ihkNonu plant 
There is considerable international activity seeking alternatives to fossil fuels for transport. 
The primary endeavours include:
 chemical processes to manufacture liquid fuels to replace diesel or petrol. These 
renewable fuels are typically bio-alcohols (for blending into petrol) produced from 
biomass via fermentation processes, or biodiesels (for blending into or replacement of 
diesel) produced from biomass-sourced oils via a trans-esterification process;
 electric vehicles which source electric power for their batteries from renewable 
electricity generation sources. This has some real advantages as: 
o The cost of electric vehicles continues to decline;
o Samoa converts electricity generation to largely renewable sources; and
o The energy efficiency of electric vehicles is at least 3 times more efficient than 
petrol engines.
Bio-alcohols 
The comments made in this section equally apply to the Electricity and Heating Sub-sectors 
in so far as bio-alcohols are considered a viable renewable fuel option in those sub-sectors. 
Although bioethanol competes with petrol in respect of price, it has some limitations 
including the following: 
 Storage: given it is the alcohol source for alcoholic beverages, it needs to be 
manufactured and stored in a regulated or controlled environment – this can be remedied 
by adding a component to denature it making it distasteful or causing nauseating effects;
 Energy content: significantly lower energy content per litre than petrol;
 Cost: relatively high cost of refining due to energy requirements and the occurrence of 
an azeotrope which limits refinement via distillation to 95%, requiring more expensive 
chemical treatment to produce anhydrous ethanol;
 Chemical compound: it is a hydroscopic compound with high water solubility, which 
poses issues in tropical environments and in storage tanks where water is present; and
 Transportation: it normally requires transportation by tankage as opposed to pipelines.
 
Bioethanol importation to Samoa for blending into petrol is not 
considered commercially viable due to the above issues, 
logistical constraints, the current world market costs, and the 
added complexity that would result from this additional 
imported fuel source. However, subject to critical economic, 
social and environmental assessment, opportunity exists to 
evaluate the establishment of a bioethanol manufacturing 
capability in Samoa derived from local feedstocks such as 
breadfruit, nonu, cassava and sugar cane. For that purpose, the 
biobutanol option (discussed below) may have significant advantages over the bioethanol 
option for Samoa’s future transport fuels needs. 
Biobutanol is a relatively new bio-alcohol which has yet to gain status as a fully proven 
commercially viable biofuel. It is classified by the USA Environmental Protection Agency as 
an approved Advanced Biofuel. The claimed benefits as adapted from the website 
www.butanol.com include: 
 Biobutanol has many advantages both as a direct biofuel and as a biofuel blend to 
existing fuels (both petrol and diesel); 
 it is a direct 'Drop-In' replacement for petrol; Jatropha plant
than ethanol (76,100); 
 it does not have intoxicating effects when digested so its manufacture and storage does 
not need to be controlled; 
 it is non-corrosive and can be shipped via pipeline rather than in tanks; 
 it has lower emissions: reduces hydrocarbon emissions by 95%; carbon monoxide to 
.01%; and oxides of nitrogen by 37%; 
 it can be made from a wide variety of non-food feedstocks such as wood and forest 
residues, temperate prairie grasses, corn stover, bagasse, and green bio-waste as well as 
low cost sugar crops such as sweet sorghum or sugar beets; 
 it has limited (7.7%) solubility in water, so there is a much less energy intensive method 
of separating butanol from water, and that is by letting it phase separate; and 
 it is 6 times less evaporative than ethanol; and 13.5 times less than petrol, making it 
inherently safer to use. 
A project at Tulane University (USA) is currently confirming the technical and commercial 
viability of biobutanol. If that investigation proves successful, biobutanol will be a very 
strong contender as a viable future renewable liquid fuel for Samoa. It is strongly suggested 
that an active ongoing assessment of this option is maintained. 
5.6.1 Biodiesels 
The section is equally applicable to the Electricity and Heating Sub-sectors in so far as 
biodiesels are considered a viable renewable fuel option in those sub-sectors. Biodiesel is 
most commonly produced from relatively low value palm oil in South East Asia and shipped 
principally to Europe to assist European countries comply with strict environmental laws. An 
option exists to import this biodiesel to Samoa, provided it: 
 is cost competitive with mineral-derived diesel; 
 can be incorporated logistically into the liquid fuels facility; and 
 will be used in blends that do not void existing equipment warranties. 
Biodiesel is currently being produced from coconut oil at the SROS facilities in Apia and is 
successfully fuelling a number of diesel vehicles. Unfortunately the economics of this process 
may be unfavourable due to; the high value of coconut oil on commodity markets, the 
significant cost of methanol and sodium hydroxide required for processing, and the 
significant energy yield reduction caused by the production of a low value by-product 
(glycerol). 
However, increasing coconut oil production in Samoa is of 
considerable strategic value and should be significantly 
encouraged via the Agriculture Sector Plan and other 
initiatives. The greatest challenge is not the technology of 
conversion into either coconut oil or into biodiesel derived 
from coconut oil, but is in the supply chain logistics for the 
raw materials. This is where the greatest sensitivity in 
production costs lie as well as the challenges to motivate and source delivery. The Energy 
Sector Plan strategy is therefore to strongly support coconut oil production thereby enabling 
and making available the future option of rapid transition to biodiesel production should 
global economics change. Biodiesel can also be produced from jatropha, another locally 
available crop, and further work is currently being undertaken in this area to assess economic 
viability in the Samoan context. 
Essentially a watching brief is required across all biodiesel options to monitor their relative 
id bblid iihld ibdd bfiilThere is considerable opportunity to expand energy efficiency initiatives in the Transport 
sub-sector, ranging from incentives to use smaller, more efficient engines and hybrid 
vehicles, improved traffic management, improved public transport options, improved vehicle 
maintenance, and so forth. There is a study underway that will look at restricting car imports 
based on greenhouse gas emissions. Any increase in electricity demand to power electric cars 
should come from renewable sources. 
Good information on vehicle registrations by type is difficult to secure and reflects 
deterioration in data quality over time. Efforts are being applied to address this extremely 
important element of transport sector energy use management. The following plot is 
indicative: 
Figure 15: Vehicle Registrations by Type 
 Source: Land Transport Authority 
5.7 Sub-Sector Policy Outcome 
The key outcome for this subsector is to have an efficient, sustainable, safe and cost-effective 
transport sector. 
To reach this outcome, transport needs to be considered in a total system context, the three 
main components being: 
 Transport infrastructure (roads, ports, sea lanes) - good engineering contributes to ensure 
minimum energy use (eg. well maintained roads, removal of speed bumps) 
 Vehicle numbers and type – energy requirements, efficiency and environmental impact 
(eg. more efficient buses); and 
 Users – driver behaviour strongly impacts on energy use, eg. social marketing campaigns 
to reduce average speed, erratic driving, etc. 
5.8 Strategic Direction 
The Transport Sub-sector Strategic Direction is one of gradual transition and positioning for 
the future, with certain activities able to be immediately implemented. In the medium and 
longer term the opportunities available offer considerable economic, employment and 
capacity building opportunities providing the resources can be mobilised. 
There appears little economic merit in advancing biodiesel production from coconut or other 
sources at this time. Encouragement is given to the increasing production of coconut oil to 
longer term strategic advantage. Substitutes for petrol deserve some applied research to 
better determine the potential resource availability and the commercial viability, but are 
considered unlikely to be economic at this time. Details of the specific Transport Activities along with performance indicators can be found in 
the Energy Sector Logical Framework in Appendix 2 for each of the strategies below: 
For biodiesel, evidence suggests making it from coconut oil may not be cost effective at this 
time. However this requires further confirmation through and Expressions of Interest 
process. Biodiesel supply from coconuts and other sources such as jatropha, and butanol 
blending options need to be regularly reassessed for economic viability, and a plan needs to 
be in place for rapid response should development imperatives arise. The commercial 
viability of biodiesel importation should also be examined. 
For bio-alcohols, a watching brief needs to be kept on bio-alcohol technologies mainly 
focused on blending into petrol (ethanol to 10%, butanol potentially unlimited) and a resource 
assessment of breadfruit, nonu and cassava (SROS & the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Fisheries) should be carried out to determine their suitability as bio-alcohol feedstocks. 
Technical and financial assessment of breadfruit, nonu and cassava for conversion to bioalcohols need to be made and the commercial viability of de-natured ethanol importation 
considered. 
For the transport fleet, development of a roadmap towards electric vehicles would be useful, 
along with consideration of other international vehicle technology developments. For owners 
of fleets of vehicles, active encouragement of fleet turnover for new more efficient vehicles 
to transition into common use should be encouraged. Lastly, energy efficient designs for road 
networks should be advanced including for example the removal of speed bumps. 
5.8.2 Transport Indicators 
The Transport component of the Energy Sector Logical Framework in Appendix 2 identifies 
key indicators against specific Activities. By 2016 it is expected that significant advances will 
have been made across the sector with identifiable improvements. Some slight increase in 
biofuel use can be expected with Samoa well positioned to adapt to changing circumstances 
over time.

in the transport sector; 6.1 Electricity Sub-sector Definition 
The Electricity Sub-sector comprises the total electricity supply system from the sourcing of 
fuels through generation, distribution and delivery to electric appliances and machinery. It 
includes both network delivered services and private supply of electricity for example 
through photovoltaic panels and batteries as well as diesel generators. 
6.2 Sub-sector Review 
This section incorporates a review of the Electricity Sub-sector, its past performance, current 
status and its resultant potential opportunities, and its composition from energy supply and 
demand perspectives. 
The Electricity Sub-sector is largely managed by the Electric Power Corporation (EPC), a 
State Owned Enterprise, which is a combined generator, transmission/distribution network 
operator, and retailer. 
Electricity is generated primarily from reciprocating diesel engine generators from facilities 
on Upolu (currently close to Apia), Savai’i and Manono Island. In addition, EPC has hydro 
generation with one major dam-fed generator on the east of Upolu and a number of run-ofriver hydro generators, most of which are close to Apia. In 2007, a small (13.5kW) solar PV 
facility with battery storage was installed as the sole generation source on Apolima Island 
(approximately 100 residents). Approximately 400kW of solar photovoltaic (PV) generation 
is currently planned to be installed at five locations across Samoa, with the prospect for up to 
7MW of solar PV generation potential planned for the future. Maximum demand on Upolu is 
currently around 18MW with a minimum current demand of around 8MW. Maximum 
demand on Savai’i is currently around 2.6MW with a minimum current demand of around 
0.6MW. 
Figure 16: Electricity Sub-sector Energy Sources 2000-2011 
 Source: Energy Policy Coordination and Management Division, Ministry of Finance 
Renewable energy currently comprises some 13% of the total energy used to generate 
electricity, down from 30% in 2000. However, given the high conversion efficiency of hydro 
and solar electricity generation (approaching 100%) and the low conversion efficiency of 
electricity generation from reciprocating diesel generators (approximately 30%), the share of 
electricity generated that is renewable is currently 37%, down from 52% in 2000. 
There is considerable potential for expanded renewable electricity generation in Samoa with 
hydro-electric opportunities, solar PV opportunities due to an abundant solar resource, and 
some biomass opportunities (via gasification and/or biofuel technologies), being the most 
advanced. EPC has a power purchase agreement (PPA) with a biomass gasification 
technology company and also a PPA with a solar company to purchase electricity at a set 
price from proposed neinstallationsIn additionthere is a largelnassessed geothermal Hydro generation plant 
Several energy efficiency initiatives exist in the Electricity Sub-sector including benefits 
associated with distributed generation, improved electricity transmission/distribution 
networks, and improved energy efficiency of appliances9
 and light bulbs. The electricity 
transmission network comprises predominantly 33kV and some 22kV circuits on Upolu and 
Savai’i. 
About 98% of the population have been electrified10 with the EPC seeking alternative energy 
options to provide electricity to those currently not connected to the grid. The electricity retail 
operations have focussed in recent years on converting approximately 75% of customers from 
post-paid accounts to pre-paid meters, with 71% of customers currently converted. Public 
Awareness programs need to be conducted including; promotion of energy efficiency and 
conservation, information on appliance energy consumption ratings, promoting energy audits 
and demonstrating ways to minimise electricity usage. These efforts will culminate in 
demand side management by developing greater consumer awareness on cost saving 
measures in terms of household and business kilowatts usage. 
The Electricity Act 2010 encourages the participation of the private sector in both generation 
and provision of electricity networks, with licencing the responsibility of the Electricity 
Regulator. 
In line with the SDS strategic focus on providing reliable utility services, effort will be 
directed to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the production and management of 
electricity. Provision of technical assistance for the EPC management and the electricity 
sector is considered essential in up skilling those involved aiming at improving reliability and 
efficiency in the electricity service for all customers. 
Electricity Generation 
The total production of electricity generated by the EPC in the 2010/11 financial year11 was 
109million kWh, slightly down on demand in the previous year. It is difficult to predict future 
demand with a number of planned new building developments and the potential uptake of 
renewables and energy efficiency by the private sector. The drop in total production is partly 
attributed to conversion of over 70% of customers to prepayment electricity meters.

Electricity supply is reliant on diesel generation which 
accounts for some 55 to 70% of total generation. 
Cost of Generation 
Hydro generation is the cheapest source of energy with a 
current direct cost to generate electricity (including 
repairs, maintenance and operational costs) estimated by 
                                                      
9 F
llif tilPifiIld’ltiitld tht 75% f dtiltiitdirect cost to generate electricity from diesel (including cost of diesel, repairs, maintenance 
and operational costs) is currently estimated by EPC at 82 sene per kWh. 
 
The cost varies significantly due to the change in cost of diesel from month to month as 
illustrated in the following table. The cost of diesel to EPC in November 2011 was SAT 
$0.67 per kWh (excluding VAGST). 
Figure 18: Varying Cost of Generation

New diesel generators are nearing commissioning on Upolu. The improved fuel efficiency 
rates of the new generators after commissioning will lower the effective cost of diesel 
generation. For example, a weighted average increase in fuel efficiency from the current 3.80 
to 4.55 kWh per litre would reduce the cost to generate electricity by approximately 20%, 
assuming operation at close to full load most of the time. 
The direct cost of diesel is the “avoided cost of diesel generation” which is an appropriate 
cost to compare any renewable energy option against. It will continue to fluctuate and 
therefore introduce risks to the relative commercial viability of any renewable energy option. 
As of June 2012 the EPC diesel cost is around SAT 260 sene per litre (excluding VAGST) 
leading to an avoided cost of generation with the new units around 60 sene per kWh. These 
estimates need to be continually adjusted as fuel prices fluctuate and the effective efficiencies 
of the new generators are confirmed. 
Structuring investment in renewable energy 
Most investment proposals assume that the current relatively high cost of diesel will continue. 
This may or may not be the case although it is reasonable to assume that the long term trend 
of high international oil prices will continue. An investment in renewable energy will produce 
a hedge against future imported diesel costs as well as contribute to greenhouse gas 
abatement. However, any contractual arrangements must anticipate the situation that the cost 
to generate electricity from renewable energy sources may at times exceed the cost to 
generate electricity from diesel. 
In addition, relative movement is expected between the costs to generate electricity from 
different renewable energy options over the long economic life of a renewable energy 
investment. For example, the cost to generate electricity from solar photovoltaic installations 
currently exceeds the cost to generate electricity from biomass. However, the cost of solar 
photovoltaic continues to drop and may eventually fall below the cost to generate from 
biomass significantly impacting on the relative commercial viability over the balance of a 15 
to 20 year economic life of the respective renewable energy options. 
For these reasons, it would seem prudent to spread the risk with a “balanced portfolio” 
approach investing in a range of renewable energy options in the almost certain knowledge 
that some investments will ultimately be more attractive than other renewable energy options. This includes the proposal to establish a demonstration facility for gasification of indigenous 
biomass; as well as the pilot plant for biodiesel production from coconut oil. Contractual 
arrangements can be structured to ensure that resources are harvested sustainably with 
adequate protection to the environment, that independent environmental impact studies form 
the basis for determining whether new species should be introduced, that research and 
evaluation of and that information remains in the public domain, while at the same time 
demonstrating commercial feasibility. 
Independent Regulation of electricity tariffs 
Independent regulation of electricity tariff setting becomes more imperative with the 
increasing diversity of sources of generation through private sector investments by 
Independent Power Producers. A regulatory regime is required that balances the interests of 
consumers as far as tariff and service standards are concerned; against the need of EPC and 
private sector investors to have certainty over earning a fair return on their investment. 
The relative movement between the costs of electricity generated from various renewable 
energy sources and that generated from diesel will have a fundamental impact on the ongoing commercial viability and the amount of operational subsidies that may be required 
unless the costs (or benefits) can be passed through to electricity consumers. The 
development and negotiation of Power Purchase Agreements which are fair to both the 
project investors (irrespective of public or private sector funds) and EPC is a key risk in 
considering any renewable energy investment decision. 
Power Purchase Agreements 
It is crucial that adequate due diligence is undertaken during negotiation of contractual 
arrangements given the commercial implications over the long asset life of any investment. 
The issues that need to be considered in negotiating a PPA include the term of agreement, 
payment term, supply conditions including technical specifications and penalties for nondelivery, power quality, and feed in tariff and formula for future changes. 
Reducing system losses 
The regulatory regime should encourage EPC to invest in initiatives that improve the 
efficiency of operations. For example, EPC generated 109m kWh and billed 90m kWh in the 
financial year ending 30 June 2011. This equated to a total system loss12 of 17.7%. This level 
of losses is not untypical of island networks although the most efficient island networks may 
achieve total system losses of 13%. Work is underway through the power expansion project 
to reduce the level of losses through initiatives such as the installation of accurate pre-pay 
meters and distribution network upgrades. Every 1% reduction in system losses would reduce 
the cost to generate electricity by around 1 sene per kWh billed. 
Demand Side Management 
Initiatives such as the replacement of high pressure sodium street lights with new generation 
light-emitting diode (LED) lanterns will reduce usage by some 600 kWh per annum per 
lantern13. New LED lights last for 50,000 hrs or approximately 13 to 14 years at 10 hours 
usage a night. Initiatives such as this will reduce the demand to generate electricity from 
diesel as well as renewable sources. 
                                                      
12 The current approach of electricity supply management, essentially managing the hydrogenerated electricity based on available hydro storage on top of the base load dieselgenerated electricity, will need to be expanded and enhanced to effectively maximise the 
electricity generated from the expanding range of renewable electricity sources. 
Distributed Generation 
Distributed generators are generators located at a home, at a business (often solar panels) or 
in a community which are capable of generating electricity for own use. They are also 
increasingly of a capacity that will be capable of supplying electricity back into EPC’s 
network that is surplus to their own requirement. It is anticipated that the renewable energy 
available from these distributed systems will increase significantly over the next 5 to 10 
years. The increasing capability of this renewable energy option presents two major policy 
considerations for Government and EPC: 
 Whether generation from renewable sources should be encouraged as one option of 
reducing the dependence on imported diesel generation; and if so, the implications for 
EPC who will still be expected to provide backup diesel generation capacity when these 
largely intermittent forms of renewable generation are unable to supply all of the 
consumer’s own requirements; and 
 Should surplus electricity be “purchased” into the EPC network; and if so, on what terms 
and conditions. 
EPC has developed interconnection agreements to allow private consumers to install their 
own renewable energy generators to meet their own electricity demand. Surplus electricity is 
fed into EPC system but EPC will not pay for it but allow these consumers to accumulate 
credits to offset electricity purchased from EPC system. 
It is recommended that a Distributed Energy Guide is developed to assist consumers in 
planning for the installation of Distributed Generation Systems. EPC must also remain aware 
of what is happening, because the system could be hugely disruptive to the network load 
requirements in the event that either, the consumer still requires a connection to the grid to 
supply back up electricity or, arrangements are required for the purchase of surplus electricity 
into the network. 
Comparative analysis of renewable energy options 
The comparative analysis of each of Samoa’s renewable generation options for electricity 
generation is indicated in the following figure. It is anticipated that this be updated as new 
information comes to hand. 
Figure 19: Levelised Generation Cost sene/kWh EPC has approximately 32,000 electricity customers. The majority of consumers are located 
on the islands of Upolu, Manono and Apolima (80%) with the balance of consumers located 
on Savai’I (20%). The majority of customers are domestic consumers (~83%) accounting for 
28% of electricity units consumed. Commercial customers (13% of total consumers) account 
for the majority of unit consumption (47%). 
Figure 20: Electricity Consumption Details 
6.2.2 Capacity Considerations 
Maximum and minimum demand on Upolu and Savai’i are currently: 
Peak Demand Minimum Demand 
Upolu 18 MW 8 MW 
Savai’i 2.6 MW 0.6 MW 
It is most significant that should the current new generation proposals be successfully 
implemented, including the current biomass gasification and solar photovoltaic proposals, 
this would substantially meet Upolu’s current electricity requirements. It should also be noted 
that, as the planned solar systems are without batteries, this will limit capacity of solar 
generators to be connected to the electricity grid to 20% of noon peak of 15MW or 3MW. 
Figure 21: Upolu Generation Mix MWh 
This would lead to the new diesel fuelled generators being required to run as back up to the 
intermittent generation and these units may not be optimally sized for this operating regime. 
Some increase in demand is possible with a number of development proposals under 
discussion. Increased modelling of possible future electricity demand and supply scenarios is 
necessary to ensure sufficient forward planning.

The two key Acts governing the Electricity Sub-sector are the Electricity Act 2010 and the 
Electric Power Corporation Act 1980. In addition to the legislation, an Electricity Regulator 
has been established to regulate the sub-sector. These are described below.
The Electricity Act 2010 
The purpose of this Act is to “provide for a new legislative framework for regulating the 
electricity sector, the establishment of the post of the Electricity Regulator and the Office of 
the Regulator, and for related matters”. It also encourages the participation of the private 
sector in both generation and provision of electricity networks, with licensing the 
responsibility of the Electricity Regulator. Regulations to be drafted under the Act will 
determine electricity tariffs. 
The Electric Power Corporation Act 1980 
The purpose of the Electric Power Corporation Act 1980 is to “consolidate and amend 
certain enactments relating to the Electric Power Corporation, its functions, operations and 
other related matters including its role in the generation, supply and use of electricity”. 
At the time of writing this Energy Sector Plan, amendments to the Electric Power 
Corporation Act 1980 from the Electricity Act 2010 had not yet been incorporated, so the two 
following points relate to the former Act as it currently stands. Section 25(3) of the Electric 
Power Corporation Act 1980 requires a licence for the purpose of carrying out electrical 
wiring work or of generating or distributing electricity, although it is not completely clear 
whether this is limited to ensuring suitably qualified persons carry out electrical wiring or 
whether it extends to enabling new generation or distribution opportunities per se. 
In the Act, there is no requirement on the Electric Power Corporation to regularly make 
electricity market data available, including supply and demand data. However, section 
51(2)(c) states that regulations may be made to prescribe further records or accounts to be 
kept by the Corporation. The benefits to the Ministry of Finance and other energy sector 
stakeholders of regulated data provision would need to be balanced against the onus on the 
Corporation, and whether the Ministry of Finance or Minister merely asking the Corporation 
to provide such data regularly (eg weekly, monthly) is sufficient. One option is that the Act 
could be amended to at least require a minimum level (eg quarterly) of data provision from 
the Corporation to the Ministry and/or stakeholders 
in general. 
Section 32(2) states that the General Manager ‘shall, 
where reasonably possible, be a qualified and 
experienced professional engineer and shall be the 
Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation’. This 
requirement of engineering experience, whilst 
preferable, may not be necessary as the role is 
essentially one of organisational leadership. 
Electricity Regulator 
The role of the Electricity Regulator is established under the Electricity Act 2010 and the 
Regulator’s Office is in the process of recruiting a full complement of resources. The initial 
focus of the Electricity Regulator, based in the Office of the Regulator, will be on assessing 
and approving the electricity tariff. The policy details of the tariff will be developed by the 
Regulator’s Office in conjunction with the Ministry of Finance’s Energy Policy Coordination In general terms, the key stakeholders of the Electricity Sub-sector consist of the electricity 
suppliers and users in Samoa. As set out in the conceptual framework diagram in section 2.2 
of this Energy Sector Plan, the key agencies responsible for implementation of the Electricity 
Sub-sector Work Programme are the Ministry of Finance, EPC, Ministry of Natural 
Resources and Environment, the Ministry of Women, Community and Social Development, 
and SROS. 
6.5 Existing Activities 
The most substantive programme in the electricity sector is the Samoa Power Sector 
Expansion Project (PSEP) with total funds obligated or committed and spent to the end of 
December 2011 standing at US$69M with the remaining US$31M to fund remaining projects

6.6 Development Opportunities and Constraints 
The Electricity sub-sector has numerous renewable energy opportunities with the greatest 
challenge to choose the most optimum developments. The electricity sub-sector could be 
substantially renewable within a very short space of time based on current long run cost 
estimates and on projects where PPA’s already exist.
Particularly on Upolu there may not be much room left 
for new generation and on Savai’i the opportunity exists 
to immediately implement renewable generation options. 
It is therefore proposed that the “Expressions of Interest” 
(EOI’s) process as explained under Sector Wide 
strategies is deployed to tease out the real opportunities 
and choose the best at this time. 
 
A structured series of EOI’s is proposed, the first two being one for solar generation options 
and one for biodiesel to fuel the diesel generators. This could for example be followed with 
one for wind and one for renewable generation on Savai’i. The greater issue may rapidly 
become oversupply of renewables and potential need to “spill” renewable energy as the 
system dynamically matches demand and supply. The electricity networks and the back-up 
generation need urgent reassessment for a significantly different mode of operation. 
6.6.1 Crosscutting Issues 
No new electricity generation proposals offer significant reductions in the cost of generation 
and consequently in the delivered price of electricity. It can be hoped that over time the 
benefits of renewables and the move away from import dependency will lead to least cost 
options, and to improved social and environmental outcomes. 
There is already some resilience in the electricity system due to the ring main configuration 
of the networks. However significant improvements in resilience can be expected with 
increasing points of supply and distributed renewable generation. Further opportunities to 
improve resilience including aspects of climate change adaptation should be examined and a 
programme of action determined. 
6.6.2 Renewable Energy 
The choice of renewable energy options for Samoa needs to take into consideration the 
differing economic benefits to be derived. Biomass options offer considerably greater 
increased economic activity over an extended period relative to options of high capital cost 
and very low operation and maintenance. 
Samoa has participated in regional renewable energy projects such as a Biomass Resource 
At ditd bSOPACPifiIldRblEPjt(PIREP) 
Solar panels on UpoluNetherlands and Regional Energy Program on Poverty Reduction (REP-POR) financed by 
United Nations Development Programme. 
Clean Development Mechanisms (CDM) should also be considered with regards to 
greenhouse gas emissions and potential funding pathways. 
Existing hydro schemes in Samoa have experienced decreasing load factors, due to change in 
climate and in part to removal of vegetation in the catchments. Some reforestation is 
proposed along with investigating means to add storage with flood retention schemes 
upstream of existing facilities. EPC also has plans to develop up to five new micro hydro 
plants in the next five years which will increase hydro installed capacity and increase hydro 
generation. 
6.6.3 Energy Efficiency 
Given the energy cost savings that an effective energy programme can provide, energy 
efficiency improvements will be given a high priority. Policy development will recognise that 
the three main energy consumer sectors – Government, Industrial/Commercial and 
Household – have different characteristics and will require different approaches. In all three 
consumer sectors measures will be a combination of advice and incentives. Specifically, the 
Ministry of Women, Community and Social Development is being asked to take a more 
prominent role in promoting energy efficiency at the individual and community level by 
identifying energy opportunities and the resultant benefits. Quite a number of initiatives are 
possible with the added benefit of demonstrating the energy sectors focus on end-users. The 
Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment will take a more prominent role working 
with the private sector, institutions, government agencies and businesses to implement energy 
auditing and advice functions. These initiatives are discussed in more detail under Sector 
Wide strategies. 
6.7 Sub-sector Policy Outcome 
The key outcome for this subsector is to have efficient, reliable, safe, affordable and 
sustainable electricity services. 
To support the objectives, electricity needs to be considered in a total system context, the 
main components being: 
 Energy source - reducing cost of energy source (e.g. through reducing cost of 
shipment) 
 Conversion efficiency - improving efficiency of conversion of energy source to 
electricity and end use (such as refrigeration) 
 System losses - reducing total system losses from generation to billing; and 
 Dependency - reducing dependence on imported fuels. 
6.8 Strategic Direction 
The strategic direction of the Electricity Sub-sector is dominated by the potential for an 
immediate step change to a substantially renewable generation situation. This requires 
significant adaptation on the part of EPC and presents significant opportunities for the private 
sector to be more actively involved as Independent Power Producers (IPP’S), potentially as 
network operators and, by means of Interconnection Agreements, at the individual consumer 
level. 
The options of hydro, solar and wind are near commercial if not commercial already but do 
not offer the economic advantages potentially available via biomass options. Biomass options Details of the specific Electricity Activities along with performance indicators can be found 
in the Energy Logical Framework in Appendix 2 for each of the strategies below: 
Key Policy 
Outcome 3 Efficient, Reliable, Safe, Affordable and Sustainable Electricity Services; 
Key Strategies 3.1 End user focused delivery of service is strengthened; 
3.2 Improve the tariff structure; 
3.3 Continue to encourage private sector involvement in electricity production; 
3.4 Promote electricity generation from proven renewable energy 
technologies; 
3.5 Promote demand and supply side-management strategies for all consumers 
and EPC; 
3.6 Promote energy efficiency strategies across all consumer sectors; and 
3.7 Greenhouse gas abatement through renewable energy (biomass 
gasification) in the electricity sector. 
Within the various strategies are specific actions related to the Electric Power Corporation 
(EPC) including a structural reform programme to ensure the organisation adapts to the new 
paradigms in the electricity sector with increased customer focus and generation widely 
deployed by the private sector in a distributed network configuration. New network operators 
may also evolve. The EPC needs to quickly establish standard Interconnection Agreements 
and critically assess the necessary grid upgrades to maximise penetration of distributed 
generation and minimise system losses. 
Wide deployment of photovoltaic panels is both technically and commercially feasible. It is 
important that only high quality PV systems (panels, inverters and other components) are 
deployed and some consideration should be given to instituting quality standards similar to 
appliances. 
The biomass opportunities offer the greatest potential economic benefits but are most 
challenging to implement. Various biomass gasification proposals are currently being 
pursued and combustion technologies should not be overlooked. 
6.8.2 Electricity Indicators 
The Electricity component of the Energy Sector Logical Framework in Appendix 2 identifies 
key indicators against specific Activities. Production of Biogas 
7.1 Heating and Cooking Sub-sector Definition 
The heating sub-sector comprises: 
 primarily biomass (firewood, coconut husks, charcoal) used for domestic, commercial and 
institutional cooking and other heating applications, as well as for industrial process heat 
(copra drying etc); 
 dual purpose kerosene (kerosene) and liquid petroleum gas (LPG) used for domestic, 
commercial and institutional cooking/lighting and other commercial, institutional and 
industrial heating applications; 
 diesel used to generate process heat for institutional and industrial applications; 
 biogas and potentially bio-liquids produced from waste streams used for provision of heat; 
 solar energy used for water heating. 
The heating sub-sector excludes heating applications 
including cooking that is derived from electricity. Based 
on the 2006 census, approximately 60% of households 
utilise biomass (firewood) as the cooking fuel source, 
including those households that utilise biomass in addition 
to another energy source such as LPG or kerosene. This 
analysis can be updated in late 2012 when there is an 
initial planned release of data from the 2011 census.
The typical amount of firewood consumed for cooking per 
household is difficult to estimate accurately. The analysis used in this Plan assumes that a 
household that uses firewood only for cooking would typically use 40kg (40% moisture 
content) across Monday to Saturday and a further 20kg on Sunday for a traditional earth oven 
(umu), or a total of 60kg/week14. Those households that use two fuel sources including 
firewood for cooking have been assumed to use 50% of the amount used by firewood only 
households. This analysis can be updated if more accurate data becomes available. 
7.2 Heating and Cooking Sub-sector Review 
This section incorporates a review of the Heating Sub-sector, its past performance, current 
status and its resultant potential opportunities, and its composition from energy supply and 
demand perspectives. 
Despite growth in recent years in the use of LPG (to some degree replacing kerosene), the 
renewable energy content for this sub-sector is relatively constant at approximately 86%, 
giving limited opportunity for additional renewable energy growth unless a viable liquid 
biofuel can be sourced and competitively priced to replace kerosene and the more expensive 
but convenient LPG. However, the use of efficient wood stoves provides a good opportunity 
for energy efficiency gains in this sub-sector. The following graph shows the component 
energy sources for the heating sub-sector from 2000-2011. 
                                                      
14 7.3 Regulatory Framework 
There is no particular regulatory framework relating to the use of the biomass for heating 
applications, and regulations relating to the use of petroleum products (kerosene and LPG) 
are limited to standard safety aspects in supply. 
There are health and safety concerns primarily at the domestic level in the use and application 
of all these energy sources, but these are not considered sufficient to warrant introduction of 
new regulations. The greatest benefits can be derived from an awareness campaign to 
encourage best practice use of these fuels, fuel substitution and improvements in efficiency. 
7.4 Key Stakeholders 
Key stakeholders are residential, commercial and industrial consumers using any of these fuel 
sources for heating and cooking. This includes market operators where kerosene and LPG use 
has been observed. The key agencies responsible for implementation of the Heating Subsector are the Ministry of Women, Community and Social Development (MWCSD), the 
Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, including its Renewable Energy Division, 
and the Ministry of Finance. 
7.5 Development Opportunities and Constraints 
As noted above, there is limited opportunity for renewable energy growth in the Heating Subsector, unless a viable liquid biofuel can be sourced and competitively priced to replace 
kerosene and the more expensive but convenient LPG. There 
are energy efficiency gains to be made. The range of 
development opportunities therefore include: 
• Installation of anaerobic digesters for large organic 
waste flows (eg solids from waste treatment plant, 
landfill sites) to produce biogas 
• Installation of anaerobic digesters at the community 
level to convert organic waste to biogas 
• Bio-alcohol (ethanol, butanol) industry & associated 
bioenergy plantation, harvesting, processing & logistics 
operation 
• Switch to renewable electricity, possibly including solar 
cooking 
• Biogas from organic waste 
• Bio-alcohol (ethanol, butanol) as fuel source to replace 
kerosene and LPG 
• Phase out kerosene as a domestic fuel 
• Energy efficient stoves (as shown) 
7.5.1 Energy Efficiency 
In addition to the above development opportunities, awareness programmes will be put in 
place to encorage: 
Energy Efficient Stovesequipment; 
 Use of fuel efficiency stoves, emphasising environmental and health benefits. 
7.6 Sub-sector Policy Outcome 
The key outcome for this subsector is to have efficient, reliable, safe, affordable and 
sustainable heat source supply. 
7.7 Strategic Direction 
Details of the Heat Strategies and specific Activities along with performance indicators can 
be found in the Energy Sector Logical Framework in Appendix 2. Due to its relatively small 
scale and already high renewables percentage there are only two Heating Strategies. These 
are however, very important in the context of cross cutting issues and also for activating 
increased community engagement in the Energy sector. 
7.7.1 Heating and Cooking Strategies 
Details of the specific Heating and Cooking Activities along with performance indicators can 
be found in the Energy Sector Logical Framework in Appendix 2 for each of the strategies 
below: 
Key Policy 
Outcome 4 Efficient, Reliable, Affordable and Sustainable Heat Source Supply; 
Key Strategies 4.1 Improve Energy Efficiency in heating and cooking; and 
4.2 Promote biogas opportunities; 
7.7.2 Heating and Cooking Indicators 
The Heating Component of the Energy Sector Logical Framework in Appendix 2 identifies 
key indicators against specific Activities.8. MONITORING AND EVALUATION FRAMEWORK 
The Sector Planning Manual produced by the Ministry of Finance mandates the development 
of a functional monitoring and evaluation framework to track the successful implementation 
of the Energy Sector Plan. 
The Monitoring and Evaluation of the Energy Sector Plan will be overseen by the National 
Energy Coordination Committee with the EPCMD as its technical arm acting as Secretariat. 
The Energy Sector Logical Framework in Appendix 2 establishes set targets to be achieved 
within the Sector Planning timeframe whilst the Responsibility Matrix in Appendix 3
matches activities to lead agencies. It is the responsibility of these identified lead agencies to 
report on the progress of their activities towards meeting their targets on an annual basis to 
the National Energy Coordination Committee.GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES:
