KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLANOutline of the Energy Master Plan and
Assessment of the First Energy 
Master Plan
CHAPTER I6 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
A. Legal Basis 
◎ Article 41 of the Basic Law on Low Carbon Green Growth and Clause 1 of Article 10 of the 
Energy Law
B. Period and Cycle 
◎ Revised and re-implemented every five years over a period of twenty years. The First Energy 
Master Plan was introduced in 2008.
C. Procedure for Establishment
◎ Reviewed and approved by three separate entities in a three-step process:
• National Energy Committee → Presidential Committee on Green Growth → State Council
D. Key Features (Under Clause 3 of Article 41 of the Basic Law on Low Carbon 
Green Growth) 
1. Matters concerning trends and prospects of domestic and overseas demand and supply of 
energy 
2. Matters concerning measures for stable import, supply, and management of energy 
3. Matters concerning the targets for demand of energy, the composition of energy source, 
the saving of energy, and the improvement of efficiency in the use of energy 
4. Matters concerning the supply and use of environmentally friendly energy, such as new and 
renewable energy 
5. Matters concerning measures for the safety control of energy; and 
6. Matters concerning the development and diffusion of technology related to energy, the 
training of professional human resources, international cooperation, the development and 
use of natural resources of energy, and welfare in energy.OUTLINE OF THE ENERGY MASTER PLAN AND 7
ASSESSMENT OF THE FIRST ENERGY MASTER PLAN
◎ Supply side plans: power, gas, renewable energy, integrated energy, etc. 
◎ Demand management and other low carbon-related plans: rational use of energy, energy 
technology development, climate change response, etc.
2. Purpose and Features of the Energy Master Plan
A. Scope and Purpose
◎ The Energy Master Plan is a comprehensive plan that covers all energy sectors, and 
systematically links and coordinates energy related plans from a macro perspective.
* As an overarching plan, it presents principles and directions for energy-related plans 
source-by-source and sector-by-sector.
◎ The main purpose of the plan is to provide a fundamental philosophy and vision for mid- to longterm energy policy while suggesting major targets to help realize these ends. 
B. Relation to Sub-Plans
◎ As a master plan, it contains a long-term perspective rather than detailed objectives. It is also 
scheduled to apply for a relatively long period of time (five years), and hence it cannot easily 
be adjusted in response to changes in the policy environment.
• As a result, excessive restrictions on sub-plans could worsen distortions caused by energy 
policies.
◎ Sub-plans will therefore be independently designed to reflect changing conditions and 
the particular needs and objectives of each plan while complying with the Master Plan’s 
fundamental philosophy and principles.
◎ Additionally, compatibility will be ensured as much as possible both between individual subplans and between sub-plans and the Master Plan.8 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
◎ Due to the increasing complexity of energy policies and growing conflicts among 
stakeholders, it is essential to actively involve the private sector in the establishment of the 
Master Plan.
◎ A channel is needed for civic groups and experts to participate from the initial stage. The plan 
must be confirmed by the National Energy Committee and Committee on Green Growth, 
which are composed of the public and private sector.
3. Changing Direction of Energy Policy
Until the 1990s
◎ The major policy objective was to secure a stable and affordable supply of energy needed for 
economic growth, daily life, and industrial production.
• The energy sector was dominated by public monopolies, and energy prices* were directly 
regulated by the government, with a priority on achieving rapid economic growth.
* In the case of petroleum products, oil prices were liberalized in 1997. However, prices continued to be 
regulated for electricity, gas, heat, etc.
In the Early 2000s
◎ The government promoted competition in the energy industry through measures such as 
structural reform of the power industry.
• The government allowed the market to decide energy supply and demand and energy prices, 
with a focus on keeping both government intervention and market failures to a minimum.
Until the First Energy Master Plan (2008)
◎ The main objective of mid- to long-term energy policy was to achieve sustainable 
development, simultaneously considering energy security, economic growth, and 
environmental impact.
* "3 Es" of Energy Policy: Energy Security, Efficiency, and Environment
• Amid world-wide efforts to respond to climate change, greenhouse gas emissions reduction 
emerged as a major issue for energy policy.OUTLINE OF THE ENERGY MASTER PLAN AND 9

B. Overall Assessment
◎ The core policy objective in the First Energy Master Plan was “Low-Carbon Green Growth."
• The plan was aimed at maximizing the use of nuclear and renewable energy and dramatically 
reducing energy intensity by curbing demand, while at the same time creating a new growth 
engine by developing green technologies.
• The First Energy Master Plan has provided the basis for a variety of measures aimed at 
achieving green growth since 2008, including enacting basic laws, establishing committees, 
and setting a national greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction target.*
* GHG reduction target of 30% from business-as-usual (BAU) by 2020
◎ Previous energy policies focused on one primary purpose, the affordable and stable supply of 
power, to support economic growth and industrialization.
• The First Energy Master Plan pursued sustainability in the energy industry and presented 
a new and advanced paradigm for creating a new growth engine through green technologies.10 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
* For renewables, between 2007 and 2011, the number of enterprises in the market increased two 
times, the number of employees four times, the volume of sales eight times, and the volume of 
exports and amount of private investment seven times.
◎ In 2012, the final energy consumption growth rate surpassed the projection of the First 
Energy Master Plan by 3.3%. 
(If the trend continues, the gap between the actual growth rate and the projection will reach 
13.3% by 2030.)
◎ The electrification of energy consumption, in which demand is focused on electricity due to 
low electricity rates, destabilized the power supply-demand balance. 
• More and more generation facilities have been constructed to meet growing demand, but this 
resulted in negative effects, such as increased GHG emissions, an overloaded transmission 
network and opposition from local residents.
◎ Overseas resources development, which was led mainly by public enterprises with a narrow 
focus on quantitative growth, resulted in increased debt without sufficiently improving 
development capability.
* "3 Es" of Energy Policy: Energy Security, Efficiency, and Environment
C. Assessment of Main Tasks
Energy Mix
◎ Key points: Maximize* the use of nuclear energy, which has both environmental benefits, such as 
CO2 reduction, and economic benefits. 
* Targeting 41% of total installed capacity and 59% of total power generation by 2030.
• Expand renewable energy to 11% of primary energy consumption by 2030 through various 
measures, including the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) and the One Million Green 
Home project.
◎ Areas for improvement: The energy mix proposed in the plan emphasized both GHG 
reduction and economic efficiency. However, it was insufficiently comprehensive in terms of 
considering such factors as feasibility*, public acceptance, power grid conditions, and safety.
* Renewable energy: potential after considering geographical/technological conditions, environmental 
regulations, etc.; nuclear energy: load-following capacity, etc.OUTLINE OF THE ENERGY MASTER PLAN AND 11
ASSESSMENT OF THE FIRST ENERGY MASTER PLAN
* Energy intensity (TOE/1,000$): 0.347 in 2006 → 0.233 in 2020 → 0.185 in 2030 
◎ Forecast vs actual consumption: Total energy consumption in Korea has increased faster 
than forecasted in the First Energy Master Plan for last five years (2007~2012).
◎ Energy consumption in the industrial sector has been increasing faster than forecasted, 
while the trend is less pronounced in the transportation, household and commercial sectors. 
* Whereas the First Energy Master Plan forecasted that energy consumption in the industrial sector 
would decrease from 57.5% of final energy consumption in 2007 to 56.1% in 2012, actual consumption 
increased to 61.4%.

Power Supply and Demand
◎ Key points: Reduce electricity demand by 7.6% by 2020 and 12.4% by 2030.
◎ Forecast vs actual consumption: Electricity demand as of 2012 was over 9% higher than 
forecasted, accounting for almost 20% of final energy consumption.
* Share of electricity in final energy consumption: 17.5% in 2007 → 19.3% in 2012
• Low electricity prices resulted in increased consumption as people switched to electricity 
from other energy sources.
* Following price liberalization, the price of petroleum products soared due to high oil prices. However, 
the increase in electricity rates was kept to a minimum out of consideration for consumer prices.

to fundamentally reduce electricity demand and peak load. 
Overseas Resource Development
◎ Key points: In view of Korea's high dependence on energy imports (96%), innovative efforts 
are needed to raise the self-development rate for overseas resources.

CHAPTER II16 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
A. Consumption by Sector
◎ The average annual growth rate (AAGR) of final energy consumption from 2000 to 2012 
was 2.8%.
* The AAGR, which was 7.2% in the 1990s, slowed considerably after the Asian financial crisis.
◎ The share of energy consumed in the industrial sector has been steadily increasing and 
currently exceeds 60% of final energy consumption.
* The shares of the household, commercial, public and transportation sectors have steadily decreased.
◎ Feedstock, such as naphtha and coking coal, accounts for more than half of energy 
consumption in the industrial sector and more than 35% of total final energy consumption. 
* If consumption of feedstock is excluded, the AAGR of final energy consumption decreases by 0.6% 
percentage points to 2.2%. 
Energy used as feedstock was the largest contributor to the increase in energy consumption. 
Industrial energy consumption soared throughout the recovery from the 2010 financial crisis.

coal electricity heat/others city gas oil
◎ Oil: The share of oil in final energy consumption reached a record high of 68.2% in 1994 
before steadily decreasing to 48.9% in 2012.
* AAGR: Reached 8.0% in the 1990s before decreasing to 1.0% from 2000 
- By oil product: gasoline 1.2%, diesel for transportation 1.4%, kerosene/light oil -2.9%, heavy oil

- Excluding feedstock: Industry 14.5%, transportation 70.2%, household/commerce 13.1%18 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
• Low electricity prices compared to other energy sources, along with convenience of use, 
accelerated the electrification of energy consumption.
◎ City Gas: Consumption of city gas increased very rapidly at an AAGR of 30.5% in the 1990s, 
but this increase slowed to an AAGR of 5.9% after 2000 due to saturation of infrastructure.
* AAGR by sector (from 2000): industry 9.3%, household/commerce 3.6%
◎ Coal: The share of coal remained in the 13% range in the 2000s before increasing to 15.4% in 
2012 due to recent rise in industrial consumption.
* The share of bituminous coal in total coal consumption, which was 50.4% in 1990, increased sharply 
to 91.8% in 2012 due to a decrease in anthracite coal consumption and an increase in the use of 
bituminous coal for power generation.
2. Global Conditions
A. Global Energy Demand Forecast
◎ Global energy demand is forecasted to increase by 48.3% between 2010 and 2035 on the back 
of economic and population growth in developing countries, and GHG emissions are expected 
to increase by 40.2%.
• Total energy demand will increase by 0.5% annually on average in OECD countries and 2.3% 
in non-OECD countries.
◎ By energy source, nuclear and renewable energy will experience the fastest growth with an 
AAGR of 2.7%.
* Among fossil fuels, natural gas will see the largest increase as a result of the distribution and 
expanded production of shale gas.BACKGROUND TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF 19

■Non-OECD countries will lead the growth in global energy demand. The share of fossil fuels 
in energy demand will decrease from 84% in 2010 to 79% in 2035 despite increased use of 
unconventional resources, such as shale gas.
B. Continued High Oil Prices
◎ Global oil prices, which averaged $94.3/bbl* in 2008, fell in 2009 following the financial crisis 
before rebounding to a record high of $124/bbl in 2012.
* Dubai crude oil
◎ Oil prices are expected to remain high, reaching $140/bbl by 2035 according to the IEA (WEO 
2012). 
* EIA's projection: $145/bbl by 203520 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
Cause · Supply-side instability in the Middle East and 
other regions
· Demand growth from emerging countries 
· Increasing marginal cost of production
Price 
Recovery
· Prices return to previous levels when 
conditions normalize · Oil prices remain high
■A steady increase in fossil fuel prices will have a large negative impact on the entire Korean 
economy, which is highly dependent on imports.
■However, continued high oil prices will accelerate the development of alternative energy and 
improvements in energy efficiency.
C. Expanded Development of Unconventional Energy Sources
◎ The development of unconventional energy sources, such as shale gas and tight oil, will 
change the landscape of the energy market.
* Unconventional gas will account for 48% of the growth in gas production by 2035. The US, which 
currently imports 20% of its energy, will achieve energy self-sufficiency by 2020.
■Regions with shale gas resources, such as China, Europe, and the US, will replace the Middle 
East and Russia, which are the largest exporters of traditional gas, as the dominant players in 
the natural gas market. 
■The markets for natural gas substitutes, such as coal and oil, are also highly likely to be affected. 1992-01 1992-07 1993-01 1993-07 1994-01 1994-07 1995-01 1995-07 1996-01 1996-07 1997-01 1997-07 1998-01 1998-07 1999-01 1999-07 2000-01 2000-07 2001-01 2001-07 2002-01 2002-07 2003-01 2003-07 2004-01 2004-07 2005-01 2005-07 2006-01 2006-07 2007-01 2007-07 2008-01 2008-07 2009-01 2009-07 2010-01 2010-07 2011-01 2011-07

THE SECOND ENERGY MASTER PLAN
◎ In the aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear accident on March 11, 2011, several countries, 
including Germany and Switzerland, announced plans to shut down their nuclear power 
plants in operation.
◎ Japan decided to phase out nuclear energy by 2030 after soliciting public comments on three 
scenarios for nuclear energy use.
* The decision was later put on hold in the face of opposition from the industry and allies, such as the 
US, and it was effectively reversed after the new government took office.
◎ Some countries are turning back to nuclear energy, including the UK, which announced plans 
to construct a new nuclear power plant for the first time in 20 years.
• The Nuclear Regulatory Authority of Japan announced new safety regulations on July 8,
2013, and plans to restart the operation of nuclear power plants after confirming their safety
under the new regulations. 
* Hokkaido Electric Power Co., Kansai Electric Power Co., Shikoku Electric Power Co., and Kyushu 
Electric Power Co. applied for safety tests on twelve reactors in five nuclear power plants.
◎ Many countries have not significantly changed their positions on nuclear energy and are 
maintaining their previous nuclear energy policies with the addition of new measures, such 
as stronger safety standards.

■Although some countries have announced plans to shut down nuclear power plants, world-wide 
reliance on nuclear energy has not changed significantly since the Fukushima accident. 22 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
◎ The Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Advanced Action (ADP) aims to 
conclude negotiations on a new post-2020 global climate framework that is applicable to all 
nations by the end of 2015.
* Whereas the Kyoto Protocol of 2008 to 2020 called for mandatory GHG reduction by developed nations 
and voluntary GHG reduction efforts by developing nations, the new post-2020 climate regime will be 
a single climate regime applicable to all participating nations.
◎ The recent 19th session of the Conference of Parties (COP 19) developed a concrete work 
plan for conducting negotiations on the new post-2020 climate regime through the end of 
2015.
• The parties agreed to come forward with their intended national contributions to post-2020 
global GHG emissions reduction by 2015.
■Persistent disagreements between developed and developing countries as well as global 
economic uncertainty have weakened the momentum for negotiations compared to the period of 
the First Energy Master Plan.
■The establishment of a new post-2020 climate regime applicable to both developed and 
developing nations is likely to put increased pressure on Korea.
F. Restructuring of the Renewable Energy Industry
◎ The renewable energy industry is going through a period of rapid restructuring due to a 
sluggish global economy and an overabundance of solar PV and wind power manufacturers.
* Reduction of the number of solar PV companies and production capacity between 2011 and 2013: 
Europe (25 companies, 2,400 MW), US (15 companies, 1,200 MW), Korea & China (200 companies, 3,200 
MW).
◎ Accelerated technology development has continually driven down the generation costs of 
renewable energy.
* Unit costs of generation: (wind power) $200/MWh in 2010 → $100/MWh by the end of 2012; 
(solar PV) $315/MWh in 2010 → $166/MWh by the end of 2012
■Although the renewable energy industry is going through period of stagnation and restructuring in 
the short-term, technology competition is likely to lead to considerable growth in the mid- to longterm.BACKGROUND TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF 23

A. Deteriorating Conditions for Power Supply & Demand
◎ Low electricity prices have led to a sharp increase in the electricity demand of the industrial 
sector and in demand for cooling and heating.
* From 2008 to 2012, electricity consumption in the industrial sector grew by 6.4% annually on average, 
making it the largest contributor to the increase in total electricity consumption. Due to a decrease in 
the relative price of electricity, electricity used for heating accounted for 25% of peak demand.

18.6 19.8 22.0 22.6 24.1 25.4
◎ The issue of electricity demand and supply should be addressed by controlling industrial 
demand, spreading an energy saving culture, and using decentralized generation.
B. Growing Demand for Nuclear Safety
◎ The Fukushima nuclear accident has heightened public concerns about nuclear safety.
• Despite moves to strengthen nuclear safety standards, including the establishment of a 
Nuclear Safety and Security Commission, corruption scandals involving suppliers have led 
to increased calls for reform of the safety management and overall culture of the nuclear 
industry.
◎ Plans for the construction of new nuclear power plants were put on hold in the 6th Basic Plan 
for Long-term Electricity Supply and Demand. 
C. Deteriorating Power Transmission Conditions
◎ Although the transmission network was expanded to prepare for the construction of new 
power plants, the difference between the location of generation sites and areas of high 
demand has caused transmission lines to the Seoul metropolitan area to be become 
overloaded.BACKGROUND TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF 25
THE SECOND ENERGY MASTER PLAN
D. Emergence of Various Controversial Issues
◎ Various controversies have arisen surrounding energy policy, including nuclear energy policy, 
spent nuclear fuel issues, and the construction of transmission lines. 
◎ Unilateral policy making by the central government has a limited capacity to effectively 
address such issues. 
E. Changing Conditions for GHG Emission Reduction
◎ Since the establishment of the First Energy Master Plan, policy efforts to reduce CO2
emissions have been strengthened. 
• In 2009, the government set a national GHG emissions reduction target of 30% below BAU 
levels by 2020.
* An emissions trading system (ETS) will be introduced as part of efforts to achieve the GHG emissions 
reduction target. 
◎ However, conditions have become less favorable for GHG emissions reduction policies.
* Supply: Limitations to renewable energy deployment, increased use of coal-fired power plants, etc. 
* Demand: Increased production in energy-intensive industries, including steel and petrochemicalsBasic Direction of the Second Energy 
Master Plan
CHAPTER III28 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
A. Inefficient Resource Distribution
◎ A low-price policy motivated by social and economic concerns has reinforced energy 
overconsumption patterns and accelerated the trend toward disproportionate use of certain 
types of energy, such as electricity.

• In particular, the electrification of energy consumption is causing serious problems.
■Significant energy loss (63%) takes place during the production process
(generation, transmission, etc.).
* 2.74 TOE of energy input is needed to produce 1 TOE of electricity.
■While a stable supply of other energy sources can be maintained by stockpiling and imports, a 
sudden increase in demand for electricity may result in a supply-demand imbalance if the supply 
infrastructure is insufficient. 
■An expansion of generation facilities could cause environmental degradation, overload the 
transmission network, and provoke a backlash from local residents.
• Low electricity prices are also a significant obstacle to the creation of new markets in less 
economical areas, such as renewable energy and smart grid.
◎ The current energy mix is based on economic feasibility without giving sufficient consideration 
to external effects.BASIC DIRECTION OF THE SECOND 29
ENERGY MASTER PLAN
B. Policies Centered on Supply and Quantitative Growth
◎ In place of aggressive measures to curb demand, large-scale, centralized supply 
infrastructure (the unified power grid) was expanded to meet growing demand.
• An expanded power grid, larger power generating complexes, and supply-demand 
imbalance in the Seoul metropolitan area have led to deteriorating operating conditions in 
the power grid and transmission network.
◎ A narrow focus on efficiency during the rapid growth of the nuclear industry had unintended 
consequences:
• The goal of achieving rapid “nuclear self-sufficiency*” resulted in decreased transparency 
within the industry, while little attention was given to investment in safety and improving the 
safety regulation system.**
* (1978) Kori #1 → (1999) Uljin #3·4 (OPR1000) → (2014) Shin Kori #3·4 (APR1400)
** The Ministry of Education and Science and Technology was previously in charge of nuclear safety 
regulation. An independent regulatory body, the Nuclear Safety and Security Committee, was 
established in October 2011 following the Fukushima accident.
C. Result-Oriented Policy Goals
◎ New power plant construction was kept to a minimum while ambitious demand management 
targets were set to achieve the policy goal of sustainable development.
* The 3rd Basic Plan for Long-term Electricity Supply and Demand attracted criticism about overinvestment in generation facilities due to the high power reserve ratio (18.4% in 2003).
◎ Overseas resources development, which was led mainly by public enterprises with a narrow 
focus on quantitative growth, resulted in increased debt without sufficiently improving 
development capability.
◎ As the current deployment rate of renewable energy is a mere 2.75% (85% of the target of 
the first plan), reconsideration of the deployment target and detailed measures to achieve the 
target are needed.
* It has been pointed out that the First Energy Master Plan did not include practical measures, such as 
funding mechanisms, to achieve the deployment target of 11%.30 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN

Second Energy Master Plan
CHAPTER IV36 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
A. Background
◎ During the drafting of the First Energy Master Plan, the National Energy Committee was 
formed as a deliberative and decision-making body by representatives of the public and 
private sectors. The opinions of interested parties were collected through public hearings 
and discussions.
* National Energy Committee: (8 members including the president, the prime minister, and heads 
of related institutions) + (11 members including industrial, academic and research professionals), 
(5 members recommended by civic groups) - total 24 members.
◎ Since that time, increasing energy-related controversies have made it all the more crucial to 
reach reasonable and amicable agreement during the establishment and implementation of 
energy policies.
◎ Therefore, whereas the collection of public opinion on the First Energy Master Plan took 
place in the final stages of planning as a matter of formality, the Second Energy Master Plan 
was designed to reflect the views of the public from the very beginning through the formation 
of public-private working groups.
• Five working groups were formed from the draft plan stage by 60 interested participants 
from industry, academia and civic groups. 
[ Main Discussion Topics of Working Groups ]
Coordinating WG
• Direction and coordination of four working groups on demand/electricity/nuclear energy/
renewable energy; setting the basic direction for the Energy Master Plan and reviewing the 
energy mix 
Demand WG • Demand forecast; target demand based on demand management effects; energy pricing 
policy; etc.
Electricity WG • Review of constraints on transmission; measures to promote distributed generation and 
reduce GHG emissions; etc.
Nuclear WG • Analysis of economic feasibility of nuclear power plants; review of nuclear scenarios; 
mid- to long-term nuclear policies, including strengthening nuclear safety
Renewable WG • Setting mid- to long-term deployment targets for renewable energy; 
improving deployment policy; etc.ESTABLISHMENT PROCESS FOR 37
THE SECOND ENERGY MASTER PLAN
◎ In-depth discussions on various energy policy issues have taken place at more than 50 
meetings since May 2013. 
◎ Seven major tasks for the Second Energy Master Plan were introduced in August 2013. The 
Master Plan was written based on reports prepared by the five working groups.
Seven Major Tasks
① Energy pricing system revision: Correct imbalance in the consumption of electricity 
and other energy sources
② Sustainable energy mix: Give comprehensive consideration to economic feasibility, 
public acceptance, the environment, grid conditions, etc.
③ Distributed generation system: Expand distributed generation, rationalize the 
transmission network
④ Stronger demand management: Manage demand in a forward-looking manner using 
pricing schemes, technology and policies
⑤ Balance with environmental policies: Strengthen GHG reduction efforts in each sector
⑥ Improved transparency and acceptability in the energy industry: Improve the industrial 
ecosystem, respond actively to energy related conflicts
⑦ Creation of new growth engine: Promote new businesses in areas such as renewable 
energy and smart grid
◎ In October 2013, the public-private working groups announced their recommendations for 
the Second Energy Master Plan based on the seven major tasks and discussions.
Key Recommendations
■ The Second Energy Master Plan should establish a consensus on the energy mix, 
including the share of nuclear energy, and present future policy directions on restoring 
the market function of energy prices, improving power grid stability, and other areas. 
 • Nuclear energy share: A share of 22%~29% for nuclear energy was recommended in 
view of changed conditions since the First Energy Master Plan.
 • Renewable energy share: A share of 11% for renewable energy was recommended 
after considering analysis of the deployment potential of each energy source.38 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN

A. Economic Growth Rate 
◎ Figure: The economy is expected to grow by 2.8% annually on average from 2011 to 2035.
* * Annual average growth rate: 6.5% from 1990 to 2000, 4.2% from 2000 to 2011 
◎ Method: The Korea Development Institute (KDI) produced the long-term economic forecast 
using the production function approach*.
* To calculate projected GDP growth, past GDP growth is divided into contributions from production 
factors, including labor, capital and total factor productivity. Forecasts for each factor are then added 
up to predict future economic growth.
B. Population and Households 
◎ Figure: The population will grow by 0.17% annually on average from 2011 to 2035 and is 
likely to decrease after 2030. The number of households will increase by 0.96% annually on 
average during the same period due to a larger share of single-person households.
• Increasing energy consumption in the residential sector is partly attributable to the rising 
number of single-person households.
* Single-person households: 24.7% in 2011 → 29.6% in 2020 → 32.7% in 2030 → 34.3% in 2035

demand outlook in the 1st plan
• Electricity demand growth is mainly attributable to increased investment in infrastructure 
as well as increased production by iron and steel manufacturers, petrochemical businesses, 
and fabricated metal product businesses whose global competitiveness increased during the 
recovery from the international financial crisis. 
• Low electricity prices have encouraged fuel switching from energy sources, such as oil and 
gas, to electricity.ENERGY DEMAND FORECAST, 47
TARGETS, AND THE ENERGY MIX
■ How is the business-as-usual (BAU) demand forecast calculated? 
 • The BAU demand forecast is based on the assumption that government policy and 
the energy consumption trends of economic players will remain constant at current 
economic growth rates. 
 • In other words, BAU outlook is the forecast with the highest probability, based on 
assumption that the current policy conditions and consumption pattern will be 
maintained. This process is applied to all countries.
■ Should demand-management effects be reflected in the demand outlook? 
 • Any expected effect from normalized electricity rates and improved demand 
management will be reflected in the target demand, not the BAU demand. 
 • [ (BAU demand: 816 TWh)-(Demand reduction target: 15%)=(Target demand: 696 TWh) ]
C. Comparison With Other Countries
◎ According to the IEA's forecast, the share of electricity in Korea's final energy consumption 
will be lower than that of Japan and similar to that of the US in 2035.

5. Share of Nuclear Energy in 2035
A. Working Group Recommendations
◎ After considering changes in electricity demand, transmission network conditions and 
public acceptance since the First Energy Master Plan, the working group recommended that 
nuclear energy represent 22% to 29% of the energy mix in 2035.
B. Considerations When Deciding the Share of Nuclear Energy
Energy Security 
◎ Given Korea's extremely high energy import dependence (96.4%), a balanced energy mix is 
needed to replace the excessive use of thermal power and other forms of energy.
◎ The decreased use of nuclear energy and the rising share of coal and LNG in the energy mix 
could bring a risk of greater exposure to global fuel price fluctuations.50 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
■ CaseⅠ: At the time of the second oil crisis in 1979, 71% of generation facilities used oil 
as fuel. As oil import prices tripled, electricity rates also rose more than three times 
from 22 won/kWh to 70 won/kWh.
■ CaseⅡ: Following the shutdown of nuclear power plants in Japan, Japan's LNG 
imports sharply increased, turning a trade balance into a trade deficit (6.6 trillion yen in 
2010 → -7.7 trillion yen in 2013).
Economic Feasibility 
◎ High prices of oil and other fossil fuels place a heavy burden on the entire economy. The 
generation cost of nuclear energy is lower than other energy sources because it is relatively 
unaffected by oil prices.
[ Generation Cost by Source (2012) ]
Nuclear Coal LNG
won/kWh 39.5 66.25 168.1
* The Working Group on Nuclear Energy concluded that nuclear energy has high economic feasibility 
even after taking into account decommissioning costs, response costs for potential accidents, policy 
costs, etc.

■ Conclusions
 • The economic feasibility of nuclear energy is maintained with a utilization rate of 80%.
 * The economic feasibility of nuclear energy further increases after taking into account 
the extra costs of coal and gas and other resources, such as GHG reduction.
GHG Reduction
◎ The use of low carbon energy, such as nuclear energy and renewable energy, should be 
expanded to reduce GHG emissions.

C. Global Supply and Demand Conditions
◎ As an energy-poor country with insufficient natural resources, Korea has an energy import 
dependency ratio of 96% while ranking 10th in the world in energy consumption.52 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
◎ Among the ten largest energy-consuming nations in the world, China, the US, India, and 
Russia (the top 4 energy consumers) have abundant natural resources by comparison.
• Japan, Germany, France, and Korea are categorized as energy poor countries.

◎ A high share of nuclear energy is a common feature of energy-poor countries.
• Before the Fukushima accident, France supplied 78.7% of its electricity from nuclear energy, 
while Japan supplied 29%, Germany 29%, and Korea 34%. 
◎ There are clear differences between the situation of Korea and that other energy-poor 
countries.
• In the case of Japan, Germany and France, the need for massive infrastructure investment is 
lower than Korea as their energy consumption is decreasing or not significantly increasing.
- Policy change on the energy mix is relatively easier in Japan and Germany since their energy 
consumption has been steadily decreasing with their reserve ratios reaching 38.5% and 96.4% 
respectively as of 2010.ENERGY DEMAND FORECAST, 53

Czech Republic and Austria, are able to secure additional supply capacity by importing and 
exporting electricity. 
◎ Germany, France, and some other countries have high potential for renewable energy 
deployment, and, as of 2011, the share of renewable energy in their final energy consumption 
is higher than Korea's 2020 target.

D. Conclusions on the Share of Nuclear Energy
■ The First Energy Master Plan suggested that nuclear power plants should supply 
energy up to the minimum load point in order to maximize the use of low-carbon 
nuclear energy (41% of total installed capacity).
■ The Working Group on Nuclear Energy recommended a downward revision of the 
nuclear energy share from 41% in the First Plan to 22%~29% in view of changed 
conditions in electricity demand, public acceptance and grid stability. 
■ At the moment, however, there are no energy sources that can replace the role of 
nuclear energy in terms of energy security, industrial competitiveness and GHG 
reduction, especially since Korea imports nearly all of its energy.
■ As a drastic reduction in the use of nuclear energy is not desirable at this point, a share 
of 29% was chosen on the basis of the working group’ recommendations. 54 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
■ A total of 43 GW of installed capacity is required to raise the share of nuclear energy to 
29% by 2035. 
 • As the 6th Basic Plan for Long-term Electricity Supply and Demand already confirmed 
the construction and operation of nuclear power plants with a total capacity of 36 GW 
by 2024, additional facilities with a capacity of 7 GW should be constructed.

■Korea is the only country where heavy oil (blue) is more expensive than electricity (green).
◎ Another source of distortion in energy consumption is that electricity rates do not sufficiently 
reflect the environmental and social costs of power generation.SIX MAJOR TASKS 57
1. Transition to Demand Management Policies
• Other costs related to issues such as extra-high voltage transmission lines for large-scale 
base load power plants and the social controversy surrounding them are also not fully 
reflected in the price of electricity.
B. Direction
■Adjust both energy taxes and electricity rates to encourage more rational consumption of energy 
and electricity.
■Gradually make energy prices reflect social costs, such as nuclear plant safety, transmission 
line maintenance, and GHG emissions reduction
◎ Taxation adjustment: Impose a consumption tax on bituminous coal* used in power 
generation, and lower the tax on LNG, which is an alternative to electricity
* Industrial uses, such as steel making and cement production, will be exempted from the tax to avoid 
hampering industrial competitiveness. 
• Lower the tax rate for kerosene and propane to ease the burden on low-income families and 
adjust the relative prices of energy sources
◎ Electricity rate adjustment: Adjust energy rates to reflect the various social costs of 
producing, transporting, and distributing power
• Costs related to nuclear power plants: Reassess the costs of nuclear decommissioning and 
waste disposal through an objective process. Other costs, including increased investment in 
safety-related facilities and the costs of responding to accidents, will be rationally calculated.
• Transmission costs: Improve power lines, including HVDC, and offer realistic compensation 
to minimize the impact on local communities.
• Conversion to clean fuel: Take into account the costs of achieving renewable energy 
deployment and the national GHG emissions reduction target.
◎ Complementary policy to support the underprivileged: Minimize the impact of the energy 
price adjustment on the vulnerable by offering energy vouchers and increasing investment in 
energy efficiency.58 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN

January 2012 - general use of more than 300 kW, educational use of more than 1,000 kW 
May 2013 - all high voltage for general and industrial use
B. Main Tasks
① Rationalization of Electricity Rates
◎ Set electricity rates at realistic levels to encourage reasonable electricity use
• Maintain realistic rates by being more flexible in incorporating cost-changing factors, such 
as fuel price changes
② Improvement of Progressive Scheme for Household
◎ Gradually improve the progressive scheme for households to reflect changes in household 
power consumption patterns
• Household consumption has increased due to the spread of home appliances, abnormal 
weather conditions, such as heat and cold waves, etc. 
* Households using more than 300 kWh per month (%): (2002) 12.2, (2008) 27.7, (2012) 33.5
◎ Changes in household composition, such as a growing number of one- and two- member 
families, have reduced the value of the progressive scheme for benefiting energy poor.
* Energy use is related not only to income level but also to household size.
◎ Consider the introduction of Time-of-Use pricing for households on an optional basis 
following the deployment of smart meters, which enable tiered pricing by hour
③ Expansion of Demand Side Management and Opt-In Pricing
◎ Expand seasonally/hourly tiered pricing to all types of power use, including optional coverage 
for low-voltage power, to accompany the expanded deployment of smart meters
◎ Develop and apply various opt-in pricing schemes to promote reasonable power consumption 
and reflect power supply and demand, individual consumption patterns, etc.
• Develop a variety of hourly-tiered pricing schemes to encourage users to invest in demand 
side management for peak reduction using private generators, ESS, etc.60 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
◎ In the mid- to long-term, review a variety of opt-in pricing schemes, including contract pricing 
between consumers and operators* and tiered pricing based on power supply quality**.
* e.g. Adopt a pricing system based on the introduction of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), and 
provide various value-added services such as electricity use tracking, device control, etc.
** e.g. Premium (high price) rates guarantee minimal blackout hours, high-quality voltage, and 
compensation for damage cause by blackouts
④ Improvement of Use-Based Pricing Scheme
◎ Simplify the use-based pricing scheme to minimize pricing differences between different 
types of use
* Power for homes, street lights, and night-time use has different load characteristics and so should 
continue to be priced separately.
• Phase in tiered pricing by voltage to reflect different production costs, while using seasonally/
hourly tiered tariffs, opt-in tariffs, and others to appropriately reflect differences in load 
factor (i.e., average load divided by peak load), load patterns, etc.

to meet growing demand, to demand side management, in which demand is reduced in 
advance in a reasonable manner.
◎ Although Korea has world-class ICT infrastructure*, it has not made the most of its ICT 
infrastructure to improve energy efficiency.
* Ranked 1st in the world: ICT development index (IDC) for 4 consecutive years (ITU), households with 
an internet connection, smart phone penetration, market share for display, etc.
• ICT has not been fully applied to the energy sector because energy prices have remained low 
and the efficiency and demand management markets are not fully developed. 
* Energy service companies are actively operating in major countries, such as the US and the EU, 
where load and efficiency management markets are well-developed.62 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
■ The US has applied the Energy Efficiency Resource Standard (EERS) to energy 
suppliers since the 1990s when it hit the limit in expanding supply facilities.
■ Energy suppliers have worked with demand management companies to identify 
demand management resources, resulting in the formation of an ICT-based technology 
market.
◎ Priority has been placed on load management projects aimed at shifting the time of energy 
use to off-peak hours in times of supply shortage rather than improving energy efficiency by 
fundamentally reducing energy demand.

B. Direction
◎ Transition to fundamental and systematic demand side management using ICT, science, and 
technology rather than temporary consumption regulations, such as indoor temperature 
limits
• Deploy demand management as a new growth industry by removing regulations and 
improving systems to enhance the added value of applying ICT, such as ESS and EMS
• Employ integrated resource planning that reflects not only supply resources but also 
demand management resources when devising supply and demand plans for each energy 
source
◎ Create a demand management market so that demand side management can be measured 
and understood as a resource and therefore treated in the same way as supply resources in 
the energy market
• Improve current systems to allow a choice between demand resources and supply resources 
based on comparison of their economic values
* US: demand management (1.7cents/kWh) 〈 supply cost (10cents/kWh), Demand management 
outweighs supply cost.SIX MAJOR TASKS 63
1. Transition to Demand Management Policies
software companies and others should be nurtured as demand management business.
C. Plan
① Energy Storage System (ESS)
◎ Initial market formation: Strengthen the leading role of plant operators and renewable 
energy businesses
• Use ESS to fulfill the frequency reserve function currently provided by thermal power 
generators
* Promote early development of the core technologies for frequency regulation, such as ESS, control 
systems, and grid control algorithms, and the establishment of operation standards and settlement 
rules to ensure an initial installation of 200,000~300,000 kW by 2015.
• To control the power quality of renewable energy, treat renewable energy facilities equipped 
and operated with ESSs as having additional capacity 
◎ Investment promotion: Encourage heavy energy consumers and public organizations to make 
a large investment in ESSs by revising electricity rates and related systems
• Advise heavy consumers with a certain amount of contract demand to install ESSs
* Select heavy power consumers and public buildings as the first targets for the installation of ESSs 
→ Expand opt-in tiered pricing and provide incentives for ESS installation, such as tax credits for 
investment
• • Use smart ESSs as an emergency power supply in accordance with relevant regulations
* * e.g. Fire safety standards for high-rise buildings, equipment standards for buildings, inspection 
standards for elevators, etc.
• Regularly monitor ESS performance after installation and, if found to be insufficient, review 
measures to mandate the phase-in ESS installation
② Energy Management System (EMS)
◎ Market expansion: Recommend the introduction of EMSs to large new buildings as well as 
existing buildings and factories which consume large amounts of energy
* Increase allotted credits for the Energy Performance Index in the Energy Conservation Design 
Standards for Buildings and revise Energy Management Standards to reflect EMS recommendations.64 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
* Give additional credits when assessing the eligibility of EMS-based energy conservation projects for 
financial support
• Provide tax credits for investment in installing EMS and lengthen the diagnosis interval when 
those subject to the Energy Diagnosis adopt EMS (3-5 years → 10 years maximum, revision 
of the Energy Use Rationalization Act)
◎ Business support: Develop energy service companies (ESCOs) with EMS technologies 
as demand side management businesses/aggregators. Moreover, give such companies 
opportunities to participate in the power market
* Profits can be generated by selling EMS-based demand management resources in the power market, 
or placing tenders for efficiency improvement performance records in the energy efficiency market.
③ ICT-based High-Efficiency Devices
◎ LED: Replace lights in subway stations, tunnels, terminals and other places with large-scale 
LED lighting using ESCO funds and PF
* 1.36 million lights in subway stations, tunnels, airports, railway stations and highway tunnels will be 
replaced first.
• Replace all lights used in public buildings with LED by 2020 and obligate the use of LED for 
mostly-on lights used in private buildings, such as underground parking lot lighting
• Give subsidies for installation to low-income families, welfare facilities, poultry farms, etc.
* In line with phasing out incandescent light bulbs starting in January 2014, jointly conduct the 
replacement program with local governments
◎ Inverter: Encourage the use of high-efficiency inverters for three-phase induction motors
* Inverters control the motors of production facilities and home appliances, saving energy by up to 30%.
◎ Smart plugs: Add smart functions to the criteria for energy efficiency ratings and efficiently 
manage the energy consumption of home appliances
* Provide a service which help consumers track the amount of electricity consumed by each product 
and control power use through a smart phone application
• Promote the mid- to long-term distribution of smart home appliances equipped with 
intelligent DR functions, such as smart plugsSIX MAJOR TASKS 65
1. Transition to Demand Management Policies
improvement projects starting from 2014
• Set and gradually expand an investment goal for efficiency improvement project compared to 
total sales.
◎ Expanded targets: Expand targets of energy efficiency improvement to gas and district 
heating operators based on the progress made by KEPCO
◎ System improvement: Based on the outcome of pilot projects, change the efficiency 
investment target to the ratio of energy savings to total annual energy sales as is the case in 
major countries
* The US has set its savings target at 0.8% of annual average consumption. 
• Seek measures to minimize the link between sales and profits (decoupling) from investment 
of energy suppliers in efficiency improvement
⑤ Promotion of the Demand Management Market
◎ Demand resources market: Create a demand management resources market to allow 
demand reduction resources (negawatts) gained from ESS and EMS to be traded the same 
way as supply generation resources (megawatts) 
• Promote profit generation and commercialization for a variety of business models using ESS, 
EMS, EHP and other demand management resources
◎ Creation of an energy efficiency market: Revise relevant regulations to allow energy saved 
during peak hours as a result of efficiency projects to be traded in the power market
• Revise regulations to allow energy saved through efficiency improvements to be traded in the 
power market, taking into consideration the progress in demand-side bidding and the growth 
of demand management businesses, such as ESCO66 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN

A. Progress
◎ Inter-ministry measures for demand management have brought continuous improvements 
in energy efficiency.
• Transportation: Average fuel efficiency for passenger cars has been improved by 32% since 
2006 when fuel efficiency standards for passenger cars were introduced.
* Fuel efficiency standards for passenger cars (km/L): (2006) 10.76 → (2008) 11.47 → (2010) 12.87 →
(2012) 14.16
• Buildings: Targets for energy conservation design standards for buildings,* including 
insulation standards and window/door seal performance grades, have been expanded (2013)
* Health care and lodging facilities bigger than 2,000 m2, offices and shops bigger than 3,000 m2 → all 
buildings bigger than 500 m2
• Appliances: 2.2 million TOE (equivalent to 1.4 trillion won of imports) has been saved annually 
by enforcing an energy efficiency labeling program for major home appliances, a system for 
saving stand-by electric power, etc.

1. Transition to Demand Management Policies
◎ Transportation: The average fuel efficiency of domestic passenger cars is slightly higher than 
in the US, but 15~20% lower than in Japan and the EU.
* Average fuel efficiency: (US) 15.3km/L, (Japan, 2010) 19.6km/L, (EU) 20.4km/L
◎ Building: There is an urgent need to improve the energy efficiency of pre-existing buildings, 
which account for 97% of total buildings, as most efficiency measures for buildings have been 
focused on newly-built buildings, public buildings and big buildings. 
• Residences, which account for 53% of all building energy consumption, face many barriers to 
implementing regulations or incentives related to residential energy efficiency.
• While energy saving for buildings had been carried out on the basis of appliances and 
equipment, energy consumption management has not been carried out systematically and 
comprehensively for entire facilities.
* Replacing existing facilities with high-efficiency ones is a main business area for ESCO.
◎ Appliance: As home appliances are integrated with ICT and become smarter, bigger and 
more connected, their electricity use has increased despite improvements in energy 
efficiency.
• For windows and built-in devices, which determine a building's insulation performance, lowefficiency and low-price products, which consume large amounts of stand-by power, have 
been installed.
* Construction companies supply low-efficiency built-in products to consumers because they do not 
bear the cost of electricity.
C. Main Tasks
① Transportation
◎ Fuel efficiency standards for cars: Design new fuel efficiency standards for 2016 to 2020 so 
that average fuel efficiency can reach the level of advanced countries by 2020 (Japan: 20.3km/
L, EU: 26.5km/L)
• Expand the scope of fuel efficiency standards from passenger cars to small commercial 
vehicles
* Fuel efficiency regulations in the US and Europe have already been expanded to cover small 
commercial vehicles.68 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
and comply with energy savings targets
◎ Eco-friendly cars: Distribute hybrid cars and clean diesel cars, which require less new 
infrastructure by 2020 and lay a foundation for distributing electric cars and hydrogen fuel 
cars 
• Build charging stations in accordance with the green car distribution rate and pursue the 
establishment of appropriate standards, revision of safety regulations and improvement of 
certification schemes
• Develop business models, such as car sharing and long-term lease services, and begin the 
formation of a new market through purchase subsidies for different vehicle types and other 
measures
* Consider the introduction of sunrise and sunset systems for subsidies and tax credits based on 
vehicle age and type
② Building
◎ Newly-built buildings: Gradually strengthen the Energy Conservation Design Standards for 
Buildings to achieve the goal of zero energy for all newly-built buildings by 2025 
* Insulation standard based on 2009 figures: (2017) 60% reduction → (2025) 100% reduction
• Strengthen the consultation system for energy use plans and recommend the efficient use 
of integrated energy and the active utilization of renewable energy when developing cities or 
industrial clusters.
* Improve the energy efficiency of heating in large-scale residential complexes through small-scale 
CHP plants and the expansion of the integrated energy supply.
◎ Existing buildings: Expand the scope of the certification scheme for energy efficiency 
performance, which currently covers only new buildings (e.g., office and apartment buildings), 
to include existing buildings
• Expand the scope of the energy performance certification scheme*, which requires the 
issuance and submission of a certificate containing the energy consumption information of a 
building in the event of a property transaction
* (2013) Apartment buildings in Seoul with more than 500 units, offices of 3,000m2 or larger → (2016) 
All buildings across the country
• Train professionals, including building energy performance assessors, to prepare for the 
possible increase in demand for the certificationSIX MAJOR TASKS 69
1. Transition to Demand Management Policies
• To ease the burden of initial investment costs, provide more subsidies for district cooling and 
gas cooling installation and promote the distribution of desiccant cooling systems* to provide 
district cooling for apartment buildings
* Desiccant cooling: a new technology which uses existing heating pipelines of apartment complexes to 
remove humidity from indoor air and uses the evaporation heat of water for refrigeration
• Expand the installation of cooling facilities for power load management (e.g., gas cooling, ice 
thermal storage) to all buildings above a certain size and treat district cooling as power load 
management equipment
③ Improvement of Appliance Efficiency
◎ Expansion of the energy efficiency management scheme: Expand the scope of the energy 
efficiency management scheme, which now applies to energy-using machinery, to cover 
energy-related products (ErP)* including construction materials (2014)
* Products that do not directly use energy but have a direct or indirect impact on energy consumption, 
such as insulation products and glass
• Establish energy efficiency management standards for built-in energy-using machinery/
products* that construction companies install and provide to residents
* Efficiency of built-in refrigerators (2011-2012 estimates): (grade 1) 3.1%, (grade 2) 2.7%, (grade 3) 
45.8%, (grade 4) 13.4%, (grade 5) 35.0%
◎ Enhancement of energy efficiency standards: Improve energy consumption efficiency by 
banning the production and sale of incandescent light bulbs, expanding the distribution LED 
lights, and distributing premium motors
• Maintain the ratio of first grade products below 20% by strengthening minimum energy 
performance standards for cooling and heating devices, home appliances and motors
* Closely regulate the standby power of set-top boxes and other devices which are on standby for 24 
hours and gradually tighten the standard for standby power of electronics (current 1W → 0.5W 2015)
◎ Creation of a road-map: Draft and present a road map for energy efficiency management 
programs, including energy efficiency labeling on products, to reduce market uncertainty
* A mid- to long-term time-line to improve efficiency should be outlined, including a 5-year (to 2017) 
regulatory directions.
• Introduce a sunset system for energy efficiency management; periodically monitor the 
operation, maintenance and termination of efficiency standards; and systematize the 
operation of energy efficiency programs70 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
scheme and other measures in accordance with the 2020 greenhouse gas emissions 
reduction target (18.5% reduction compared to BAU).
◎ Small and medium sized companies (SMEs): Encourage voluntary energy conservation by 
providing additional support and incentives
* Target SMEs which are not subject to the target management scheme and the emissions trading 
scheme
* Promote factory energy management systems (FEMS), provide conservation consulting services, 
facilitate financial and technological cooperation between big and small companies (green credits), 
and offer policy support, such as financial and tax incentives 
◎ Promotion of energy management systems (EnMS): Promote systems to systematically plan 
and implement energy demand management and energy efficiency activities in industry
* Develop manpower and educational programs, bolster international certification and cooperation for 
measuring and verifying efficiency performance
Response measures for different industries and sectors
• Steel: Develop technologies* for CO2-free steelmaking and promote ICT-based 
energy management systems
 * The replacement of coal with hydrogen in the steelmaking process is expected to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions by 30%.
- Operate in-house commercial power generators, improve the use of thermal energy 
through waste heat and by-product gas recovery and promote distributed generation
 * POSCO operates in-house generators with capacity of 2.88 GW, equivalent to 3 reactors.
• Petrochemicals: Invest in equipment for better heat recovery (larger heat exchangers), 
improve processes to minimize standby power, install waste vapor reuse facilities 
(MVR), etc.
• Vehicles: Facilitate R&D and early commercialization of environmentally friendly 
vehicles; remove energy-intensive stages, improve the manufacturing process by 
constructing resource-recycling plants,1) etc.; and diversify the energy mix2) to 
protect the environmentSIX MAJOR TASKS 71

construct resource-recycling plants where captured CO2 can be used as a resource 
 * 2) Introduce photovoltaics, fuel cells and other renewable energy sources for vehicles and 
processes, adopt VOC recovery systems, etc.
• Others: Increase the use of emergency generators and replace low-power facilities 
(e.g., semi conductors), install wind power facilities (ship building), use lighter 
materials to improve transport efficiency (e.g., textiles), etc.
5. Reform of the Energy Information Management System
■Systematically manage and share information on energy supply, demand and reduction 
technology to improve the effectiveness of energy policy
◎ Demand management: Create a virtuous cycle of policy implementation, analysis/
assessment, and policy improvement
• Cooperation of consumers: Obtain from consumers consumption information and patterns 
regarding transportation (region, type of car, engine displacement), homes and buildings 
(location, type of use, size), factories (type of business, location, size), etc.
* Consumers who volunteer to provide the information may receive incentives, while heavy consumers 
may be required to submit the information.
• Analysis of policy effectiveness: Analyze energy consumption patterns and other information 
to assess the effectiveness of each policy, including pricing policy and reduction of energy 
consumption for each sector, and make policy measures more precise and efficient
◎ Demand outlook: Use Energy information service systems to provide timely and appropriate 
information for policy makers and energy consumers through a reliable energy forecasting 
system
• Open and integrated systems: Establish a system for cooperation on statistics and policy and 
conduct joint forecasting between energy suppliers and related organizations. Additionally, 
seek cooperation with outside professional agencies72 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
reliability and authority
◎ Future technology: Develop technology portfolios, including the best available technology* 
that can be applied in advance, by reviewing and analyzing demand management 
technologies and policy trends at home and abroad
* e.g. Ultra Super Critical (USC), carbon capture storage, and other energy conversion technology for 
reduction.
◎ Establishment of infrastructure: Establish a system to collect end user energy consumption 
data and set up a legal and institutional framework to expand related infrastructure- Six Major Tasks - 2. Establishment of a

A. Progress
◎ Stable power supply: Industrial competitiveness has been improved by producing a stable 
and affordable supply of energy through large-scale power plants (nuclear, coal, etc.).
• Korea has grown to have the world's 13th highest installed capacity with a total installed 
capacity of 81.8 GW as of the end of 2012.

2. Establishment of a Distributed Generation System
◎ Power generating conditions: Current power policies are now facing limitations because of 
opposition from local residents and environmental concerns despite the continued expansion 
of the power supply led mainly by large plants
• Opposition from local residents and environmental advocacy groups has often resulted in 
hold-ups or cancellations of plant construction, causing disruptions in the power supply. 
◎ Power transmission conditions: The transmission lines which deliver electricity northward to 
the Seoul metropolitan area have reached full capacity due to the disparity between areas of 
high power consumption and plant locations.

◎ Minimize the construction of new extra-high voltage lines and construct such lines only when 
unavoidable, such as when expanding nuclear and other power plants for policy reasons and 
improving the public grid
D. Plan
◎ Give priority consideration to grid constrains when formulating the Basic Plan for Long-term 
Electricity Supply and Demand.
• Avoid the past approach of formulating transmission plans only after planning plant 
construction
• In the future, integrate both plant construction plans and transmission installation plans into 
a single package
◎ Provide location guidelines/grid maps to utility operators in advance
• Encourage operators to choose locations where no additional grid construction is needed by 
offering them location guidelines before conducting intent surveys
◎ In the mid- to long-term, consider applying differential transmission fees according to plant 
locations, with lower fees for the plants near a demand site
* Currently, plants do not bear transmission fees.
2. Promotion of Distributed Generation
■Supply more than 15% of electricity from small-scale, distributed sources by 2035 (currently 5%) 
■Finalize detailed measures in the Distributed Power Sources Promotion Plan (expected to be 
available in 2014)
A. Current status
◎ Distributed sources account for 12% of Korea's power grid in terms of installed capacity, but 
only 5% in terms of actual generation and contribution to the power grid.SIX MAJOR TASKS 77
2. Establishment of a Distributed Generation System
Integrated Energy (5.83GW) Co-generation of heat and electricity, sold exclusively to consumers in certain areas
In-house/
private Generator (4.88kW) Generating power internally to meet a portion of general power needs.
Renewable Energy (4.08kW) solar PV, wind, geothermal, fuel cells, ESS, etc.
B. Obstacles
◎ Current policy has limited the rise in electricity rates, while prices of LNG and other fuels 
have increased, making in-house/private generators and integrated energy less economically 
viable. 
2005 2012 rate of increase
electricity price 74 won/kWh 94 won/kWh 27%↑
gas price 453 won/㎥ 884 won/㎥ 95%↑
* Japan: The price of industrial-use electricity in Japan is more than double that in Korea. As a result, 
distributed generation facilities account for almost 23% of total installed capacity (price as of 2012 ($/
MWh): Japan 194, Korea 82). 
◎ Need to improve the inconsistent power quality of renewable energy by developing advanced 
technologies, including microgrid
C. Implementation measures
① Promotion of In-house/Private Power Generators
◎ Encourage energy intensive companies and industrial clusters larger than a certain size to 
meet some of their demand by in-house/private generation
• Revise electricity tariffs (stricter peak pricing) and offer incentives for power conservation, 
such as energy use rationalization funds and tax benefits78 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
product gas
Best practices of POSCO
■ 70% of POSCO's power consumption needs are met by in-house/private generation 
(2.90 GW, equivalent to 3 nuclear reactors).
■ POSCO uses waste heat and by-product gas as a main fuel. Additionally, it has adopted 
high-efficiency LNG combined generation using by-product gas and other fuels in 
addition to LNG since 2000.
② Promotion of Integrated Energy
◎ Review possible reforms of energy pricing, taxation and subsidies with a view to improving 
the profitability of integrated energy supply and the fair treatment of energy sources
◎ When granting permits, give preference to larger-scale projects involving more than 
50,000~100,000 households and more than 100MW in order to achieve economies of scale
• Strengthen evaluation of measures to diversify business, such as ensuring low price heat 
sources, developing district cooling supply plans and cooperating with local operators
◎ To improve economic feasibility during summer, commercialize desiccant cooling, which 
is suited to apartment complexes, and expand the number of buildings targeted for the 
adoption of district cooling (e.g. larger than 3,000㎡→ larger than 1,000㎡)
③ Promotion of distributed renewable energy
◎ Promote projects for small-scale energy distribution to meet the daily energy demand of 
homes, villages, schools and others with renewable energy 
• Introduce a photovoltaic rental business to provide one-stop service to help anyone easily 
install and maintain such devices
* Existing government-led initiative: Consumers pay for the 50% of the initial investment, and a 
subsidized 3-year warranty is provided over the 20-year product life. 
• Create a renewable energy complex by designating certain areas to receive support for a 
total package of solar PV, wind power and ESSs (Currently, support is provided for individual 
energy sources.)SIX MAJOR TASKS 79
2. Establishment of a Distributed Generation System
* Benefit Sharing: In Germany, citizens' generators that are invested in and owned by residents are 
becoming more common.
◎ Build power supply systems for specific sites (islands, buildings, etc.) with a focus on 
distributed generation through development and demonstration of microgrids
* For islands, demonstrations have been underway at three sites, including Jeju island (Gapa island), 
by local governments and KEPCO with total funds of 41.2 billion won. For buildings, an industrial 
complex has been created in GuroGValley as part of the K-MEG project.
D. Plan
◎ Confirm details in the Distributed Generation Promotion Plan (2014) and the 7th Basic Plan 
for Long-term Electricity Supply and Demand
3. Efficient Planning and Operation of the Transmission Network
■Change the process of planning and constructing transmission lines in such a way as to improve 
the stability of power grid and the level of social acceptance
A. Grid conditions
◎ There is an increased possibility of massive blackouts in the event of transmission line 
malfunction because of increased installed capacity at four major power generation sites, 
concentrated demand in the metropolitan area, etc.
◎ Because KEPCO, the Korea Power Exchange and plant operators share responsibility for grid 
operation, it is unclear who is responsible for what, and this lack of clarity is a limitation when 
preventing and responding to accidents.
* There is no impartial supervisory body. Every party involved takes the role of player and judge at the 
same time and focuses more on profits than grid safety.80 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
① Enhancement of Acceptance When Constructing New Transmission Lines
◎ When the construction of extra high voltage transmission lines is unavoidable, carry out 
complementary measures, such as burying HVDC lines underground
* HVDC lines are more socially acceptable as they have no distance restrictions, deliver power over 
long distances with underground cables, and emit few electromagnetic waves. However, Korea lacks 
practical experience in this area.
• Establish grid control and operation strategies that are appropriate for the features of HVDC 
and achieving self-reliance in HVDC technology
◎ Commence the construction of transmission lines only after giving full consideration to the 
opinions of local residents at every stage, from selecting routes to finalizing construction 
plans
② Stable Operation of Transmission Lines in the Metropolitan Area
◎ There has been a gradual rise in grid instability, including an increased possibility of fault 
currents, as the power load is concentrated in the Seoul metropolitan area, which has a looptype transmission grid
◎ Continuously retrofit the grid to ensure the stable operation of transmission lines. 
Additionally, in the mid- to long-term, consider reconfiguring the loop-type grid, introducing 
a load-dispersing pricing scheme, etc.
• For the short-term, take measures to retrofit facilities, such as installing reactors and 
increasing breaker capacity, to reduce faults
• For the mid- to long-term, review the possibility of dividing the Seoul metropolitan area into 
small, alternate current network areas and to link with BTB HVDC
• Review possible pricing schemes to disperse the demand in the metropolitan area and 
others for the mid- to long- term
③ Improvement of the grid reliability management structure
◎ Establish a specialized body dedicated to impartially managing and supervising the national 
grid along the lines of the US NERCSIX MAJOR TASKS 81
2. Establishment of a Distributed Generation System
◎ Create "Power grid reliability standards*" to improve grid reliability to the level of advanced 
countries and to establish clear-cut lines of authority and responsibility among related

and strengthen industrial competitiveness 
Regulation-oriented GHG 
reduction Technology and market-oriented GHG reduction
A. Progress
◎ Introduction of regulations: The institutional basis has been laid for reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions by establishing the Greenhouse Gas and Energy Target Scheme (implemented in 
2012) and Emissions Trading Scheme (enacted in 2012).
* The national emissions reduction target was announced in November 2009: 30% below the BAU level 
by 2020.
◎ Creation of a carbon market: A voluntary carbon market (Korea Voluntary Emission 
Reduction Program (KVER)) has been operated since 2005. Korea will also launch a national 
emissions trading market (allocation market), the 4th of its kind in the world, in 2015. 
* KVER: The government pays for greenhouse gas emissions reduction achieved by companies 
participating in the target scheme without reduction obligations.
** ① EU (2005), ② New Zealand (2008), ③ Australia (2015, considering an early launch in 2014)
B. Limitations
◎ Increase in GHG emissions: Despite reduction efforts, greenhouse gas emissions have been 
steadily rising due to the prevalence of energy-intensive companies, the export-oriented 
industrial structure, etc.
* Greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 increased by 9.8% compared to the previous year. Energy 
consumption from 2010 to 2012 was also greater than initially forecasted, and greenhouse gas 
emissions continue to rise. 
* GHG Intensity (tCO2/million won): (2007)0.617 → (2010)0.641 → (2011)0.643SIX MAJOR TASKSS 85
3. Improvement of Sustainability of Energy Policy
competitiveness.
* Business competitiveness may be weakened as the GHG emission permits to be allocated from 2015 
may lead to increase in production costs, reduction in sales, etc.
• While the target scheme has come into effect, most businesses have not yet taken action and 
are lacking in reduction capacity.
■A survey released in January 2012 showed that more than 80% of companies lacked methods to 
reduce emissions sufficiently. 
■Methods for achieving emissions targets are mostly aimed at improving the efficiency of 
processes and facilities, doing little to reduce emissions in the long term. (2012: 71%, 2013: 73%).

C. Main Tasks
① Creative Response Using Technology and the Market
◎ New strategies for climate change in the creative economy: Design national policies to create 
a new market and industry in response to climate change based on science, technology and 
ICT (2014)
■Present new policy directions to improve energy efficiency using ICT, increase R&D investment 
in key clean technology for the future, create a new market and industry in climate, etc.
■Develop measures to combat climate change for coal-fired plants and energy-intensive 
industries, which are the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions86 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
result of the introduction of the Emissions Trading Scheme
■Energy-intensive and export-oriented industries (e.g., carbon-leakage industries) need to take 
measures to prevent carbon emissions and job leakage.
■ETS compensation program: Review measures to help carbon-intensive industries avoid a loss 
of competitiveness, such as carbon leakage
◎ Promotion of an offset market: Design offset programs to help industry achieve cost-effective 
reduction of GHG emissions in the ETS
■Review the use of green credits in the domestic offset market, which can be earned from the 
Korea Voluntary Emission Reduction Program, renewable and energy efficiency projects and 
other projects
■Encourage small-scale emitters, such as companies with reduction obligations, to implement 
offset projects
◎ International response: Actively participate in international efforts to address climate change 
using technology and the market
■Take appropriate measures in response to the technology-driven climate change initiatives led 
by the US (e.g., exporting efficiency technology, employing environmental strategies that can be 
used as an advantage in trade such as stricter standards and certification, etc)
 ※ Negotiation on the post-climate change system (to be completed in 2015): Breaking from the 
Kyoto Protocol, which focuses on reduction obligations for advanced countries and voluntary 
reduction for developing countries, a single framework that will bind all countries is being 
negotiated.
② GHG Emissions Reduction in the Power Generation Sector
◎ Adoption of reduction technology: Apply the best available technology to new plants, taking 
into account the technology's commercialization timing, and evaluate the reduction efforts of 
such plantsSIX MAJOR TASKSS 87

◎ Demand management: Promote an ICT-applied demand management market to create a 
level playing field for demand resources to compete with supply resources
• When the power supply is stabilized, integrate and operate existing similar demand 
management systems as reliability demand response and economic demand response
* Reliability demand response: Reduce and shift load away from peak hours to stabilize power supply 
and demand
Economic demand response: Reduce power supply costs through bidding and competition among 
power generation resources in the power market
◎ Fuel conversion: Increase the operation rate of LNG plants to promote distributed generation, 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, etc.
③ Enhancement of Businesses' Capability to Address Climate Change
◎ Support for vulnerable sectors: Increase support for sectors of high vulnerability to address 
difficulties arising from GHG reduction compliance and help improve competitiveness
■Take inventory of SMEs, develop reduction technology, offer financial support and tax credits for 
industries concerned about a loss of competitiveness, etc.88 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
cooperation between businesses, including large companies, SMEs, and industrial complexes
■Green Credits: Review the possibility of recognizing emissions reduction achieved with capital 
and technology investment of large companies in SMEs as external reduction performance 
(offsets) under the target scheme and emissions trading scheme
■Industrial cluster: Switch to low-carbon industrial clusters by establishing integrated energy 
monitoring systems and joint power generation using waste heat
◎ Professionals: Identify promising job opportunities and systematize current manpower 
training programs based on the analysis of the supply and demand dynamics of human 
resources needed in Korea's climate change sector
◎ Specialized companies: Systematically nurture specialized service companies, including IT 
specialized ESCO companies connected to power and carbon markets and conservation (DR) 
consulting firms
■Design measures to promote service companies specialized in energy demand management 
and greenhouse gas emissions reduction (2014)
◎ Global green market: Establish comprehensive support mechanisms, supporting all stages 
of a project from selection and planning to financing and implementation, to help domestic 
businesses enter foreign markets
■Benchmark again the Green Initiative implemented in 2010 by the Japan Bank for International 
Cooperation. Under this Initiative, green projects selected by the government are financed by 
public funding and private investment.SIX MAJOR TASKSS 89
3. Improvement of Sustainability of Energy Policy
■Continuously strengthen the stability of nuclear power through nuclear industry reforms, such 
as introducing an open and check system and improving the management and supervision 
systems of nuclear operators
■Aim to become a Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) export powerhouse by 2020
In the Past New Policy Paradigm
Industrial 
Reform for Safety 
Reinforcement
· Emphasize efficiency and economic 
feasibility of NPP construction and 
operation 
· Achieve self-reliance in NPP 
technologies within a short period of 
time → “Choose and Focus strategy”
· In general, give operators autonomy 
in business management
· Prioritize safety to assure public 
acceptance
· Introduce a system of checks/
surveillance + openness/competition
· Strengthen management and 
supervision to prevent corruption 
and reinforce safety
Promotion of 
Nuclear Industry 
as Export Industry
· Establish a bridgehead to export 
NPPs
· Prioritize the export of NPP systems
· Concentrate on profitable projects 
for the national economy 
· Export both nuclear parts and 
equipment
A. Progress
◎ Electricity supply: The foundation for a stable electricity supply was maintained by 
constructing NPPs as scheduled, securing new sites and efficiently operating NPPs
• Three NPP units have already been constructed*, and candidates for new NPP sites 
(Yeongdeok/Samcheok) have also been officially announced.
* Shin-kori Unit 1 (February 2011), Shin-kori Unit 2 (July 2012), Shin-wolseong Unit 1 (July 2012)
◎ NPP exports: Korea is the 6th country in the world to export nuclear power plants (4 units of 
APR1400 to the UAE in September 2012). 
• The industrial foundation has been laid for creating a high-added value chain through 
self-reliance in three core technologies, including Reactor Coolant Pumps, Man-Machine 
Interface Systems and design code90 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
tasks).
B. Limitations
◎ There have been limitations in creating a sound foundation for the industry in the process of 
the rapid growth of the NPP industry over a short period of time
• As Korea has pushed for 'NPP self-reliance*' in a short span of time, a few institutions and 
companies with a competitive edge have inevitably played a leading role in the formation of 
the industrial ecosystem.
* (1978) Kori unit 1 → (1999) Uljin unit 3 and 4 (standard reactor (OPR1000)) → (2014) Shin-kori unit 3·4 
(new pressurized light water reactor, APR1400)
• As a result of the nuclear industry's focus on a high level of technical expertise and 
specialization, it generally lacks competition, openness and supervision, leading to corruption 
and cronyism. 
• The management system has been relatively lacking in safety and transparency, as the 
nuclear industry has overemphasized efficiency-oriented NPP construction and operation, 
and performance, focusing on increasing capacity factors, shortening construction periods, 
etc. 
◎ There is a growing need to bolster the systematic management and supervision over stateowned NPP companies
• The management activities of state-owned NPP companies are subject to virtually no 
government management and supervision, unlike government-led activities regarding 
technical safety and electricity supply and demand management.
• The lack of a self-regulating and monitoring structure in the market as well as the insular 
structure of the industry have resulted in persistent problems, such as certificate forgery and 
corruption scandals.
◎ Since Korea won a contract to build NPPs in the UAE, global competition in the NPP market 
has become fiercer, while Korea has not taken sufficient measures to secure the foundation 
for NPP exports.
• Korea is less experienced in project financing and lacks large-scale government funding 
compared to rival countries, such as Japan and Russia, where a large amount of government 
funding is available.SIX MAJOR TASKSS 91
3. Improvement of Sustainability of Energy Policy
C. Main Tasks
① Safety-First Nuclear Policy
◎ Safety investment: Increase investment in safety to significantly enhance nuclear safety in 
Korea
• In the wake of the Fukushima accident, there has been increased investment in nuclear 
safety to prepare for natural disasters and other risks, and more focus has been put on the 
development of safety technologies.
* Enlarging coastal barrier, securing vehicles with portable generators, building hydrogen gas removal 
systems not dependent on electricity, etc. (2011~2015, 1.1 trillion won) 
* Share of nuclear R&D dedicated to safety: 2012: 100 billion won (23%) → 2017: 40% → 2035: 60%
◎ NPP operation: Shift to a safety-first NPP operation system
• To improve planned preventive maintenance, conduct sufficient safety monitoring and 
maintenance by expanding the list of items monitored and maintenance periods, and 
minimize outages during operation
* Main items monitored: 50 items → 100 items Standard maintenance period: 30 days → 35 days or 
longer
• To enhance the management of aged plants, conduct stress tests on plants whose operation 
licenses have been extended, preemptively replace equipment older than 20 years, etc.
• Switch to a safety-first management system by shifting from efficiency-focused management 
assessment of nuclear operators to safety-oriented assessment
◎ NPP construction: Construct nuclear power plants with the world's highest level of safety
• Thoroughly carry out quality tests and verification* of construction materials and nuclear 
parts regardless of construction deadlines
* The originals of test result sheets should be verified, and witness tests should be conducted by the 
Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Corporation. Additionally, third-party organizations should verify 
quality.
• Construct new reactors (APR1400)*, which have a much improved safety record compared to 
the existing standard reactor OPR1000, and develop a next generation reactor (APR+)**92 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
** Aiming at completing technology development by 2015 (100 times safer than OPR1000 in case of 
severe accidents)
② Reform of Nuclear Industry
◎ Develop short and mid- to long-term anti-corruption measures by identifying structural 
problems in the nuclear industry, including the non-transparent procurement system, and 
gradually enforce such measures
■Short term: Immediately implement improvement measures and periodically carry out followup management in accordance with the government's comprehensive plan (June 2013)
 ① Eradication of collusive ties: Prohibit retirees of state-owned NPP companies from employment 
in cooperating companies, restricting bidding by companies hiring such retirees, etc.
 ② Improvement of procurement: Minimize direct contracting without bidding, introduce prequalification, disclose procurement plans in advance, etc.
 ③ Enhancement of quality: Examine documents related to the quality of NPP parts to determine 
whether such documents are forged by third party independent organizations
■Mid - to Long-term: Seek fundamental measures to foster competition in the industry and 
enhance the transparency of the value chain
 ① Encourage competition/expand supply networks in the nuclear market 
 * Standardizing parts by opening markets dominated by certain companies to competition, 
easing bidding requirements by lowering entry barriers (delivery performance requirements) 
for newcomers, and creating a localized road-map by eliminating demand for certain 
companies
 ② Improve procurement procedures/ reform procurement management system
 * Establish a price system based on original cost to prevent below-cost competition that could 
cause quality degradation and to guarantee appropriate prices; implement a Multiple Award 
Schedule to make insular procurement practices more transparent; develop an Integrated 
Management System to systematize complicated management systems; and strengthen the 
contractor management process to weed out substandard contractors
 ③ Enhance quality self-assessment of the nuclear industry
 * Making it clear where responsibility lies within the nuclear industry to prevent forgery of test 
resultsSIX MAJOR TASKSS 93
3. Improvement of Sustainability of Energy Policy
• Enact an Act on Management and Surveillance of Nuclear Operators to serve as an 
overarching law to manage and supervise the four stated-owned NPP organizations, which 
have related functions
* Share safety-driven management goals among the Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Corporation, 
KEPCO E&C, KEPCO NF and KEPCO KPS, build inter-organizational cooperation and coordination 
mechanisms, and monitor and assess activities to enhance safety and prevent corruption
• Establish a nuclear industry policy council* to coordinate the distributed management 
and supervision roles of stated-owned NPP organizations and facilitate a speedy decisionmaking process
* Participants: Office for Government Policy Coordination (Chair), Ministry of Strategy and Finance, 
Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, etc.
* Discussion topics: Supervision to promote safety-driven management, measures to build public trust 
in nuclear safety, etc.
◎ Greatly enhance the safety management capabilities of the government and nuclear industry
• The regulator, the Nuclear Safety and Security Commission, should tighten safety 
regulations* and expand enforcement manpower, while related ministries, including the 
Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, focus their support on safety equipment investment 
and technology development.
* Introduce an inspection system for parts suppliers, designate a specialized certification organization 
for testing and inspection agencies, etc.
• Secure a sufficient number of safety management personnel before establishing a system 
for supplying manpower optimized to ensure safety
* Secure necessary manpower by downsizing headquarters and increasing staff quotas and assign the 
manpower to equipment maintenance and repair units
* Implement a system for securing sufficient human resources in advance (2 years ahead of the 
actual placement) to provide skilled professionals on site in a timely manner. Additionally, establish 
standard job classifications for each type of nuclear reactor.
• To strengthen the comprehensive and continuous capacity of the Korea Hydro & Nuclear 
Power Corporation in terms of safety assurance, undertake extensive and voluntary reform 
in three areas: organization, human resources and corporate culture
■Organization: Strengthen the expertise and role of the procurement team, create a new team 
dedicated to engineering, reinforce the function of the audit team, etc.94 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
senior executives for each NPP site, stipulate primary HR policies as company regulations, etc.
■Corporate culture: Make safety and integrity as core company values, benchmark against 
domestic and international best practices for safety, etc.
③ Promotion of NPP Exports
◎ Select projects that are profitable to the national economy
• Select target export countries and strive to win contracts after reviewing financing capacity, 
policy credibility, electricity supply and demand outlook, etc.
• Decide whether to participate in a project based on a thorough review of project feasibility by 
a public-private consultative group
• Establish export strategies tailored to promising projects/countries and carry out interministry efforts to win contracts
◎ Develop professional manpower for NPP exports by providing systematic training, increasing 
staff quotas in a timely manner, etc.
• To ensure a sufficient number of professional personnel for the construction and 
maintenance of the UAE NPPs, adjust staff quotas of state-owned companies to sufficient 
levels in a timely manner in consideration of training periods
* Train overseas projects specialists by providing systematic training programs specially devised for 
the design of reactors for export (APR1400)
• Systematize the process for state-owned companies to secure manpower needed for 
overseas NPP contracts
◎ Plan and implement strategies to export parts and equipment along with NPPs 
• Build a high-added value NPP supply chain through technology development, package 
development and other measures and provide support to ensure a stable procurement route 
in the international nuclear market
* Provide support at every stage, from R&D for essential equipment to commercialization, domestic 
sale, and exportSIX MAJOR TASKSS 95
3. Improvement of Sustainability of Energy Policy
regularly disclosing information on NPP operations and constantly communicating with local 
residents
• Promote activities of environmental watchdog groups, which help residents directly 
participate in monitoring and overseeing the environment and safety of NPP areas
• Expand and conduct safety monitoring with the participation of local residents, and designate 
a spokesperson to deliver regular monthly briefings on overall NPP operations for each NPP 
site
◎ Community benefits: Revise community support projects to ensure that government 
and operator funds are used effectively for purposes such as increasing incomes for the 
community 
* Revise support projects to effectively bring mutual benefits to nuclear energy and the community (e.g., 
task force teams consisting of community, operator and government)
* SOC-oriented projects → community assistance focused on income generation and direct support for 
residents

◎ Establishment of foundation: The Korea Radioactive Waste Agency, which was set up in 
January 2009 to manage radioactive waste disposal in Korea, is constructing a waste disposal 
facility in Gyeongju.*
* As of July 2013, 95.9% of the first phase construction is completed. Preliminary design and other 
activities are underway for the second phase.
◎ Basis for public involvement: The Public Engagement Commission on Spent Nuclear Fuel* 
was launched and has began to build consensus for the management of spent fuel.
* Established in October 2013, the commission consists of representatives from the liberal arts and 
social studies, technology and engineering, civil environmental groups, NPP-located communities, 
etc.
◎ Delay in implementation: The scheduled construction completion date was postponed 
twice*, first due to issues regarding the first phase construction of low and intermediate level 
radioactive waste disposal facilities and second due to reinforcement work to ensure safety.
* The construction completion date for the first-phase facility: (originally) December 2008  (extended 
to) December 2012 → (extended twice to) January 2014
◎ Lack of decommissioning technology: Technologies for decommissioning have not 
been commercialized at the industry level as Korea lacks experience decommissioning 
commercial NPPs as well as the necessary engineering technology and experts
* Korea has 17 core technologies among 38 decommissioning technologies, which is about 70% of the 
international level.
B. Direction
① Promotion of Public Involvement in Spent Fuel
◎ Start establishing management measures from 2015 based on the results of public 
discussion by the Public Engagement Commission on Spent Nuclear Fuel created in October 
2013
• The Commission will supervise the general discussion processes, including discussion on 
ground rules and topics, and will convey the results of the discussion to the government by 
the end of 2014.
• Form an inter-ministry consultative group led by the Office for Government Policy 
Coordination to bolster communication and cooperation between the Commission and 
relevant ministriesSIX MAJOR TASKSS 97
3. Improvement of Sustainability of Energy Policy
facilities in 2014 in a timely manner on the principle of safety-first 
• Complete the first phase construction in a timely manner. Beginning with the designing 
stage in the second phase, thoroughly conduct* safety inspections
* Carry out technology consultations with overseas experts (ANDRA in France, etc.) and geographic 
investigation of fault lines and other factors during preliminary designing
③ Commercialization of nuclear decommissioning technology
◎ Secure in advance industrial capacity to commercialize technologies that can be directly 
applied to decommissioning nuclear facilities
• Identify categories of technology for commercialization, factoring in applicability and 
marketability, and seek to achieve technology demonstration and manpower development 
through customized demonstration projects*
* (e.g.,) Large waste disposal technology → decommissioning pilot projects for aging NPP parts, such 
as steam generators
4. Enhancement of Safety Management of Energy Facilities
■Moving away from the ‘supply first, safety later’ approach for industrial development, move 
toward an energy safety regime of prevention and systematic management to protect the safety 
of the public
 • While strictly managing safety issues that directly affect public safety, continuously enhance 
other safety regulations regarding private participation and business activities

expanded its organization and human resources for energy safety
• Established an energy safety experts committee and an energy safety division under the 
Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) and an safety management committee for 
energy public enterprises
• A system has been established to respond to energy-related cyber issues with the launch of 
the National Cyber Security Center in 2008
◎ Spread of safety-first culture: A safety-first culture has been fostered in state-owned energy 
companies, from the CEO level to workers in the field, and private companies have a greater 
awareness of the importance of safety assurance
• Safety assurance is now stipulated in management contracts with CEOs and safety 
commitment conferences and safety education sessions are held on a regular basis
B. Limitations
◎ Safety regulation system: There have been difficulties in effectively implementing safety 
policies due to the absence of safety governance involving both MOTIE and public energy 
enterprises and the low participation of the private sector
◎ Safety service promotion: There have not been sufficient development of and support for 
safety services using experience and technology, including safety diagnosis for gas and 
electricity facilities and workplace safety assurance
◎ Cooperation for safety: The current response capability to new energy safety issues arising in 
areas such as industrial complexes and cyberspace remains insufficient.
C. Main Tasks
① Expansion of safety systems and development of safety technology

Jeju Smart Grid Test Bed
* Development of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), Energy Management System (EMS), Energy 
Storage System (ESS) and other key technologies
◎ NPP exports: Korea has become the 6th country in the world to export nuclear power plants 
(UAE: APR1400 4 units, December 2009).
• The foundation has been laid for high value-added industrial development by achieving selfreliance in three core technologies: reactor core design code, reactor coolant pumps, and 
man-machine interface systems102 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
◎ Korea lacks world-class technologies needed to increase its global market share.
• Despite increased investment in energy R&D, Korea's technology level* and industrial 
competitiveness** have remained below those of major countries.
* US 83.4% > EU 83.1% > Japan 80.4% > Korea 68.8% > China 62.9% (as of 2010, NTIS)
** Global market share for green energy in 2010 (Source: Roland Berger, 2012): China (24.5%, 1st), US 
(17.8%, 2nd), Germany (12.8%, 3rd), Japan (7.8%, 4th), Brazil (4.8%, 5th), Korea (2.2%, 9th)
• The industrial benefits of energy R&D investment have been lessened by the insufficient 
size of markets for new energy technologies, such as smart grid, high efficient buildings and 
energy storage.
* Only 29% of the government's energy R&D projects have been commercialized (2013 research 
outcome utilization survey)
◎ Sufficient preparations have not been made for the transition to a future-oriented energy 
system.
• There is a need to focus on innovative R&D, demonstration, and deployment to support 
commercialization in order to prepare for the transition to an innovative energy system based 
on distributed generation and ICT. 
* To switch to a system that uses the latest energy technologies, such as smart grid, ESS, K-MEG 
and CCS, efforts should be made to facilitate the demonstration and deployment processes, where 
technologies are actually applied to the energy network.
◎ Insufficient efforts have been made to resolve social controversies, including concerns about 
energy safety.
• Technology should be developed to prevent energy-related accidents,* which have become 
more frequent in recent years.
* Yeosu Industrial Complex outage (January 2011, damage 70 billion won), hydrofluoric acid leak in the 
Gumi Industrial Complex (September 2012), etc.

and the Korea Resources Corporation (KORES) has grown into one of the worlds top 80 
mining companies.
① (KNOC) 50,000 B/D → 241,000 B/D, World's top 90 → World's top 70
② (KORES) Annual production of $300 million → $2 billion, World's top 100 → World's top 80
◎ Advancement into key markets: Regional hubs have been secured and inroads have been 
made into new markets in the UAE, Iraq and other countries in the Middle East, which has the 
world’s highest oil reserves.
• Supply and demand hubs of major minerals, including bituminous coal, copper and steel, 
have been established in Central and South America, Australia, Indonesia, and other regions, 
and the efforts to develop rare earth metals in emerging, untapped regions, such as Africa, 
has been expanded.
B. Limitations
◎ Excessive emphasis on quantitative growth: Public enterprises have focused narrowly on 
short-term gains because they used the self-sufficiency rate as a rigid, short-term indicator 
of success.
• Insufficient technology and experience developing and operating mines has been gained 
given that projects related to operating rights for oil fields and mines accounted for 37.6% 
of all projects, and the share of KNOC’s investment in exploration projects was a mere 10% 
from 2008 to 2012. 
* Proportion of operating rights projects: 77 out of 205 projects (37.6%), KNOC 55.6%, KOGAS 14%, the 
private sector 26.2%
◎ Weakened investment efficiency: The debt ratio of public enterprises has soared, and it is 
now agreed that past resource development was focused excessively on external growth 
through M&As and equity investment.
• The debt ratios of public enterprises, including KNOC and KORES, have more than doubled 
over the past five years, increasing to the point that the level of debt threatens their financial 
soundness. 
* State companies’ debt value (2007→2012, trillion won): (KNOC) 3.7 → 18, (KOGAS) 8.7 → 32.3, (KORES) 
0.4 → 2.4112 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
◎ Insufficient infrastructure for growth: Not enough has been done to establish infrastructure, 
such as human resources, R&D, and government support systems, necessary to take the 
overseas resource development industry to the next level.
* Human resource: Mismatch between supply (mainly university graduates with bachelor’s degree) 
and demand (for graduates with master’s or doctoral degrees).
 Technology level: Korea’s technology level is 47% of that of advanced countries. Moreover, research 
has largely been conducted in laboratories, and as a result it has failed to reflect reality in the field. 
■Although the quantitative growth strategy, including the enlargement of public enterprises, 
could be considered successful in so far as it was necessary to secure the mid- to long-term 
growth of the overseas resource development industry.
■there have been negative effects, such as the weakened financial soundness of public 
enterprises and insufficient efforts to improve quality.
C. Main Tasks
① Enhancing Capabilities for Long-term Energy Security 
Using new indicators and terminology for resource development
◎ The “self-sufficiency rate/self-development rate” should be renamed the “resource 
development rate,” because the word “self” leads the public to mistakenly believe that the 
“self-sufficiency rate/self-development rate” is equivalent to the amount of resources flowing 
into Korea.
• The resource development rate should be calculated by year (annual production/annual 
imports), instead of by the actual number of days of operation (daily resource development/
daily imports).
◎ Use the resource development rate as a long-term policy indicator, rather than as a shortterm, rigid performance indicator which have undermined investment efficiency
• In order to ensure that the growth of public energy enterprises is centered on exploration, 
adopt the management efficiency indicators (e.g., securing new reserves) of global 
exploration and production companies as performance indicators of public enterprisesSIX MAJOR TASKS 113
4. Enhancement of Energy Security
◎ Encourage the introduction of foreign resources for which domestic companies hold 
exploitation rights
• Amend existing mining rights contracts to bring minerals to Korea in case of emergency. 
Moreover, provide larger loans for projects that can be implemented in Korea under the 
success-repayable loan program1)
. 
◎ Enhance oil stockpiling capacity to better respond to instability of short-term supply 
and demand. For example, jointly stockpile oil with global E&P companies and public oil 
enterprises of oil-producing countries.
• Stockpile rare metals, such as chrome and molybdenum, that are essential for domestic 
industrial production, as planned.
② Strengthening the Foundation of Public Energy Enterprises 
◎ Focus on exploration: Decrease investment in the form of simply buying shares and enhance 
mid- to long-term resource development capability by putting a greater emphasis on 
operating licenses, exploration and development.
• Korea National Oil Cooperation: Increase the average proportion of investment in mining 
exploration to over 20% of total investment between 2013 and 2017 from current 10%, and 
enhance the success rate of exploration by concentrating scattered exploration capabilities
• Korea Gas Corporation: Take advantage of KOGAS’s strong LNG purchasing power to pursue 
vertically integrated projects related to introduction through joint development in North 
America and other regions in cooperation with global E&P companies
• Korea Resources Cooperation: Make large investments in operating rights projects rather 
than a diversified portfolio of small projects, and pool the capacities of domestic enterprises* 
to jointly enter new markets
* (KORES) Technological prowess and global trustworthiness + (End user company) Purchasing power 
+ (Trading company) Marketing + (Mine Reclamation Corporation) Mine reclamation + others
1)In Korea, a government loan system to support overseas resources development projects was 
established in 1984 in order to initiate the development activities of private/public companies. 
According to this system, Resource developing companies are obliged to pay back the principal and 
the interest when they succeed in their resource business.114 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
governance, improving human resources and technological prowess, etc.
• Korea National Oil Cooperation: Build key capabilities by increasing exchange in technology, 
information and human resources as well as joint exploration projects with leading global companies
• Korea Gas Corporation: To pursue vertically integrated LNG projects, secure key 
technologies and operational capacity needed at every stage of the process, from 
development and liquefaction and transport.
• Korea Resources Cooperation: Focus on initiating new investment projects and increasing 
the production of existing investment projects. In addition, expand the company’s mid- to 
long-term profit base and accumulate technology and know-how in mine operations.
◎ Financial soundness: Improve the debt ratios of public enterprises to the level of global 
companies by selling distressed assets, securitizing assets, attracting financial investors, etc.
• Conduct asset sales from a long-term perspective that considers various factors, such as 
business feasibility and market conditions, rather than carelessly selling assets in a short 
period of time
③ Promoting Private Sector Investment in Overseas Resource Development
Attracting more financial investors
◎ Promote private sector investment by expanding the investment guarantee scheme for the 
Resource Development Fund from the current 1.9 trillion won to 4 trillion won by 2017, and 
by enhancing principal protection for investors in the fund
• Enhance training programs, such as courses to train experts in managing financial assets 
related to resource development, to strengthen the capabilities of financial investors in the 
field of resource development
◎ Securitize sound assets with stable cash flows to provide investors with more opportunities 
for participation, and increase the investment capability of resource development companies
Expanding and reorganizing support for the private sector 
◎ Expand the budget for success-repayable loan programs and revise the loan system to select 
and focus on promising projects, such as operating rights projectsSIX MAJOR TASKS 115

stages of development and production
Entering related industries
◎ Create systems to enable cooperation, such as information sharing, between domestic 
resource exploration companies and businesses in related industries, such as plant 
construction and ship building.
• Provide incentives based on the level of participation of related domestic industries in the 
development stage. Such incentives may include preference for resource development 
companies when applying for loan programs. 
④ Strengthening Industrial Infrastructure by Training High-quality Workers and 
Conducting Practical R&D
Training high-quality workers with the skills businesses need
◎ Revise the basic curricula of universities specializing in resource development to produce 
high-quality workers through professional training with a focus on practical skills
• Form consortiums among universities to encourage each university group to be specialized 
in a different area and to be involved in exchange with universities overseas to strengthen 
global competence
◎ Train high-quality workers skilled in specialized technologies* through cooperation between 
businesses and universities/graduate schools, and launch training programs in skills ranging 
from law and contracts to accounting
* To develop a high-tech workforce, encourage research focusing on geophysical oil exploration, 
unconventional resource development, including shale gas and oil sand, and mining development. 
◎ Form partnerships between universities and companies with overseas locations so that 
workers can gain field experience through on-the-job training programs in businesses 
overseas
Promoting practical R&D 
◎ Shift from small-scale, laboratory-centered research driven mainly by academia and 116 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
• Promote R&D on core technologies for developing resources such as shale gas, and 
encourage active participation by businesses to secure sites for demonstration
* Conduct R&D projects whose results can be demonstrated in shale gas fields in North America 
(2013-2017, 10 billion won annually).
* Under success-repayable loan programs, give preference to private enterprises which provide sites 
needed to conduct R&D.
◎ Actively promote industry-university-institute cooperative projects, and encourage 
businesses to conduct research projects with leading universities/graduate schools which 
have specialized technologies.
• Companies should provide field data for research purposes and carry out joint research with 
universities and research centers on core technologies needed for enhancing operational 
capabilities, such as increasing production.
2. Further Deployment of Renewable Energy
■ Achieve renewable energy deployment rate of 11% by 2035
■ Develop the domestic renewable energy industry into one of the world's top five by 2035
A. Current Status
◎ Deployment: As of 2012, 3.18% of the total primary energy supply was produced from 
renewable energy. Waste-to-energy, bio and hydro energy accounted for 92% of total 
renewable supply. 
* Compound Annual Growth Rate (2008-2012, %): Solar PV (41), Wind (20), Fuel Cell (109), Geothermal 
(43), and Bio (33)
• Renewable power accounted for 3.7% of total power generation, and waste-to-energy and 
hydro power made up 80% of total renewable energy generation. 
◎ Industry: The renewable energy industry has shown strong growth with exports increasing 2.6 
times and private investment increasing 2.4 times over the previous four years. SIX MAJOR TASKS 117

• More than 70% of total funding was allocated to three main energy sources, solar PV (32.2%), 
fuel cell (21.9%), and wind power (16.4%). 
B. Evaluation
◎ Deployment: The share of the total primary energy supply from renewable energy reached 
2.75% in 2011, which is 85% of the target (3.24%). However, the gap between the actual and 
target numbers has been rising. 
* Actual deployment against the target: 94% (2008) →92% (2009) →88% (2010) →85% (2011) 
[ Evaluation of Domestic Conditions for Renewable Energy Deployment ]
Wind ·Installation is difficult because of environmental and location regulations and other factors.
Offshore ·Tidal power and tidal current power may have an impact on mudflats and fishing.
Hydro · The construction of large-scale dams faces difficulties due to environmental concerns and opposition 
from local residents, and the amount of power generated is decreasing.
Bio ·A high import dependence and low prices due to fierce competition are limiting deployment in Korea. 118 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
• External factors: Oversupply in the global market, intensified competition due to falling 
prices, as well as a low distribution rate
• Internal factors: Location regulations and low public acceptance have resulted in a low 
deployment rate, limiting the size of the domestic market.
◎ R&D: The localization of core technologies in Korea has been low. Moreover, the link between 
technology commercialization and investment is weak due to the absence of technology 
commercialization programs.
* The average import rate of main parts, materials and equipment (2011): Solar PV 79%, wind power 
85%, and fuel cells 91%
• Inefficiencies, such as a disconnect from mid- to long-term investment, have arisen due to 
a lack of consideration for technology commercialization and separate budget allocation for 
different programs and energy sources.
◎ Policy environment: The policy environment is unfavorable due to low electricity rates, 
insufficient financial support, etc.
• Electricity rates are consistently low compared to generation costs, leading to increased 
consumption of fossil fuels and undermining the deployment of renewable energy. 
◎ Low public acceptance: Although the necessity of renewable energy is widely recognized, 
opposition to high electricity rates, poor follow-up management of facilities, complaints from 
residents, and insufficient promotion efforts have led to low public acceptance. 
C. Mid- to Long-term (2035) Renewable Energy Deployment Targets 
◎ Deployment targets are based on supply potential, which is estimated through consideration 
of various factors, including economic feasibility, location regulations, and deployment 
conditions.
Estimating the potential supply of renewable energy
① Upgrade the existing resource map by improving accuracy and reliability
② Estimates are based on the following steps, using the resource map:

 (2) The amount in consideration of geographical conditions for locating facilities (e.g., 
not including railways, roads)
 (3) The energy generation amount at the current technological level (e.g., solar PV 
efficiency of 16%)
③ Estimate supply potential by adjusting technological potential to take account of 
location regulations and economic feasibility
◎ Despite relatively poor conditions for renewable energy deployment, the 2035 deployment 
rate target has been set at 11% in the interest of energy security, greenhouse gas reduction, 
and other considerations.

① Creating New Markets and Converging Related Systems
◎ Renewable Heat Obligation (RHO): Adopt the RHO, which requires new buildings to use a 
certain share of heat energy from renewable sources
• First, require new buildings with more than 10,000㎡ in total floor space, except for residential 
and public buildings, to meet 10% of their heat energy demand with renewable sources
◎ Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS): Introduce the RFS, which requires transportation fuel to 
contain a minimum volume of renewable fuel
• Initially, the RFS will be applied to biodiesel. Subsequently, a decision on whether to apply 
the RFS to bioethanol and biogas will be made in consideration of various factors, such as 
domestic supply and demand of raw materials, technology, and infrastructure. 
◎ Recommendation to heavy power consumers: Advise heavy power consumers to install 
their own renewable energy generators. A decision on whether to make such installation 
mandatory will be based on the results of such installations.
• Review targets for the recommendation as well as required installed capacities of renewable 
energy by business type and size. Additionally, create incentive programs, such as a program 
linked to the GHG emission reduction
◎ Establishment of an integrated market: Integrate the renewable energy certificates (REC) 
markets for power, heat energy and transportation fuel to provide obligated entities with 
flexibility in terms of implementation and to expand the size of market
• Link not only to renewable energy related programs, such as RPS (power), RHO (heat energy) 
and RFS (transportation fuel), but also to other energy programs, including the Greenhouse 
Gas and Energy Target Scheme and the Emissions Trading Scheme
② Improving Existing Systems for Further Deployment and Enhancement 
Reorganizing the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS)
◎ Integration of the solar PV and non-solar PV markets: Integrate the solar PV market into 
the broader market from 2016 in order to give more options to power generators, increase 
flexibility, etc.
* An independent market for solar PV has been created for the first four years (2012-2015) out of 
concern that deployment will be slow due to low economic feasibility. However, this has led to limited 
investment in solar PV. SIX MAJOR TASKS 121
4. Enhancement of Energy Security
energy sources to include additional types of energy source to the RPS
◎ Promotion of distributed power generation: Allow private power generators (e.g., solar PV 
power generator rental), energy donations (to social welfare centers) and other relevant 
activities to be counted as implementation of renewable energy
Improving deployment projects and loan programs 
◎ Convergence: Revise deployment projects to take into account the entire local community, 
instead of a single home or building
◎ Focus on performance: Adopt a system that provides incentives later in proportion to the 
amount of energy actually generated, instead of one that only provides subsidies for the initial 
investment stage of the project 
◎ Expansion of the rental business: Introduce a new business model in which customers pay 
rental fees and private power generators cover all costs, from the installation of generation 
facilities to customer service, without government subsidies 
* This business model will gradually be applied to other energy sources, such as fuel cells.
◎ Reform of loan programs: Create loan programs for technology commercialization and 
decrease the size of loans for energy sources with economic feasibility
③ Support for Strategic Deployment and Export Competitiveness
Improving the strategic use of renewable energy 
◎ Support for areas with high potential for use: Expand renewable energy deployment to 
isolated islands heavily reliant on expensive fossil fuels, particularly diesel generators
• In order to improve public acceptance, provide incentives for plant construction projects with 
local participation in regions where opposition from local residents is likely
◎ Convergence of new technologies: Adjust the weight of the Renewable Energy Certificate 
upward when an ESS is established alongside wind power facilities. This may also be applied 
to other energy sources in the future. 122 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
accordingly
Increased support for exports 
◎ Support for overseas projects: Provide package support for overseas projects, from the initial 
stage to installation, in order to encourage domestic companies to enter overseas markets 
◎ Strategic entrance into foreign markets: Pursue a package-type export strategy that, for 
example, links renewable energy exports to overseas resource development rights, as well 
as participating in renewable energy projects when winning contracts for fossil fuel power 
plant
* Korea will participate in projects launched by developing countries seeking to introduce renewable 
energy systems. Possible projects include resource exploration, designing laws and institutions, and 
constructing infrastructure (standards and verification).
◎ Establishment of international standards: Establish the existing five domestic standards as 
international standards by 2014, and propose another five new standards by the end of 2014
E. Promotion of Strategic Technology Development
① Strengthening Strategic R&D and Shifting to a Performance-centered Paradigm
◎ Expansion of R&D and creation of portfolios: Focus investment on renewable energy R&D 
until 2024. Investment should grow more than 5% annually. 
• Produce a mid- to long-term investment strategy, including investment size and technology 
development priorities, in consideration of deployment targets, the mid- to long-term 
renewable energy mix, economic effects, etc.
◎ Market-leading program: Strategically reorganize the ongoing 9 programs into 5 pilot 
programs, including applied strategy and market-leading, to commercialize technologies and 
cut generation costs
• Establish four R&D strategies - low cost, technology commercialization, future 
technology, and testing - in order to quickly achieve grid parity and enhance technological 
competitivenessSIX MAJOR TASKS 123
4. Enhancement of Energy Security
deployment, in which R&D projects suitable for the deployment policy are discovered and 
pursued
• Identify more commercial R&D projects that have a high potential for commercialization and 
develop R&D projects that go beyond convergence of different energy sources to include 
different fields
◎ Launch of new programs: Launch new R&D programs aimed at reducing generation costs in 
order to secure competitiveness. In addition, diversify energy sources, such as geothermal, 
solar, and offshore energies, through technology development.
• Invest in future technologies to secure core technologies with the target of commercialization 
within 10 years
3. Enhancement of the Global Energy Cooperative System
■Faced with an extremely high energy import dependence, Korea should pursue strategic 
multilateral energy cooperation in order to enhance security by securing stable energy sources, 
etc.
A. Need for International Cooperation 
◎ Global interdependence: Global issues have arisen that no single country can solve, such as 
price volatility, the development of unconventional energy sources and climate change. 
◎ Energy security: Korea imports 96% of the energy it consumes. Northeast Asia can be called 
an “energy island” because of its geographical isolation.
◎ Enhancement of international status: Korea should exercise leadership in the international 
community as a country which has achieved rapid economic growth and built infrastructure 
for this growth through the “efficient economic growth model”. 124 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
◎ North America: Expand trade with North America, which is expected to lead changes in the 
global energy market because of its increased production of unconventional resources
• Secure advanced technology by conducting human exchange programs and joint research 
on future convergence technology, such as energy efficiency and smart grid

C. Establishment of Governance for Energy Cooperation in Northeast Asia
◎ Necessity: Establish a cooperative system for the mutual benefit of Northeast Asia to respond 
to rapidly-changing global market conditions
◎ Major issues: Discuss cooperation on nuclear safety, the resolution of the Asian premium 
issue for oil and gas, the interconnection of Northeast Asian energy transmission networks, 
the commercial use of the Arctic Sea Route, etc.
◎ Channel to discuss energy cooperation: Create a system for energy cooperation in Northeast 
Asia with the participation of six ministers from South Korea, North Korea, China, Japan, 
Russia and Mongolia
• Reorganize the current “Intergovernmental Collaborative Mechanism on Energy Cooperation 
in Northeast Asia” (Korea, Russia and Mongolia, director-general level) to play a larger role, 
or build a new channel for this purpose
Intergovernmental Collaborative Mechanism on 
Energy Cooperation in Northeast Asia (Since 2005)
 • Members: Four members: South Korea, Russia, Mongolia and North Korea, which 
stopped attending after 2008. China and Japan are observers, and the UN ESCAP is 
temporarily serving as an interim secretariat. 
 • Function: To discuss energy cooperative projects in Northeast Asia and build an 
information network

• A comprehensive fund, such as the Northeast Asian Development Bank currently under 
discussion, may be used, or the establishment of a fund dedicated to energy cooperation may 
be considered.- Six Major Tasks - 5. Establishment of 
a Stable Source-bySource Supply System
CHAPTER V130 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
A. Supply and Demand Forecast 
◎ Global supply and demand forecast: Short-term supply and demand is expected to improve, 
and mid- to long-term supply and demand is expected to remain stable. 
• In the short term, global economic growth will slow, while supply and demand will be in 
balance due to increased production by non-OECD countries. 
- The increase in non-OECD countries’ supply will be led by the production of unconventional 
oil in North America, including the U.S. and Canada. 
• In the mid- to long-term, global oil demand is estimated to grow by approximately 0.9% a 
year, reaching 109.4 million b/d by 2035 (assuming an average annual economic growth rate 
of 3.0%). 
- The production capacity of OPEC members and the supply of unconventional oil, such as 
oil sand, from non-OPEC members are expected to increase, providing enough supply to 
consistently meet demand. 
◎ Forecast for domestic supply and demand: The supply-demand balance is expected to 
remain stable in the mid- to long-term.
• In the short-term, an increase in the use of feedstock, such as naptha, for industrial 
purposes and an increase in demand from the transportation sector will result in modest 
growth of about 1.1% in 2014 despite the downward trend in demand for oil for heating and 
power generation. 
- Global oil prices and domestic demand will increase slowly, making it possible to secure a 
stable supply.
• In the mid- to long-term, due to a continuous decrease in demand from non-transport 
sectors, total demand is estimated to fall from 2020 at an average annual rate of 0.15% to 
approximately 773.9 million barrels by 2035.
* Oil dependency: 52.0% (2000) → 38.1% (2011) → 34.1% (2020) → 26.9% (2035) 
- Thanks to active overseas resource development and an increased rate of refinery 
upgrading, the capacity to supply oil products will improve in the long-term. However, 
decreased demand is expected to result in oversupply.SIX MAJOR TASKS 131
5. Establishment of a Stable Source-by-Source Supply System
① Stable Supply
Stable supply of oil 
◎ Diversify import sources to reduce dependence on Middle Eastern oil, reduce premiums and 
other disadvantages, and contribute to supply stability
Enhancement of crisis management capability 
◎ Enhance capability to flexibly respond to shifts in the oil stockpiling paradigm
• Draft a new Oil Stockpiling Plan that reflects the increasing risk of oil price surges due to 
supply instability in the global oil market
* Oil Stockpiling Plan: The 1st Plan (1980-1989), 2nd Plan (1990-2003), and 3rd Plan (1995-2010) have 
been completed. The 4th Plan is currently being prepared
◎ Continue to pursue an international joint stockpiling project with governments of oil 
producing countries, international traders, etc.
• Conduct an indirect stockpiling project, in which KNOC’s oil storage facilities are leased to 
oil producing nations and others, in order to store crude oil and oil products in Korea (Secure 
priority to purchase stored oil in case of emergency, etc.)
Stronger international cooperation 
◎ Expand cooperation with major oil-producing countries to secure stable oil import channels
• Form an international cooperative system to conduct national projects, such as an 
international joint stockpiling project and an oil hub construction project
* Seek to host the World Petroleum Congress organized by the World Petroleum Council and IEF 
Ministerial Meetings
② Improving the Industrial structure
Establishment of a Northeast Asian oil hub 
◎ Establish a Northeast Asian oil hub to integrate the energy industry with service industries, 
such as logistics, processing, finance, and trading132 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
Promotion of competition in the oil distribution market
◎ Promote competition using market forces by invigorating the spot market for oil (e-commerce) 
through successful oil distribution policies
• Secure an adequate supply for the spot market through supply by non-refineries, such as 
import and e-commerce involving four major oil refineries, etc.; formulate measures to meet 
demand for oil through economical gas stations2), the sale of mixed oil, etc.
• Once competition in the market is sufficiently stimulated, help level the playing field by 
encouraging the development of a system of free competition among market players
Improvement of oil quality management
◎ Establishment of a crackdown system: Form a system to conduct regular joint crackdowns 
and monitoring by relevant agencies until the sale of adulterated gasoline is eliminated
* Crackdown on the illegal distribution of solvents, from the supply stage to the end-user purchase 
stage, to prevent such solvents from being used as ingredients in adulterated gasoline
◎ Computerized system for reporting supply and demand: Computerize the system for 
reporting supply and demand and trading conditions for oil products in order to catch signs of 
illegal distribution at an early stage.
2) A type of gas station where consumers can buy oil at a cheaper price. KNOC supplies oil to these gas 
stations by purchasing oil in large quantities.SIX MAJOR TASKS 133
5. Establishment of a Stable Source-by-Source Supply System
A. Supply and Demand Forecast
◎ Global supply and demand: The Asian market is expected to lead the increase in demand 
for natural gas, and the supply of natural gas is expected to grow as the development of 
unconventional gas in North America picks up pace. 
• From 2010 to 2035, global demand for natural gas will show the largest increase among 
primary energy sources backed by rising demand from emerging economies, such as China, 
India, and Brazil. 
* Forecast for global demand for natural gas (billion tons, IEA): 2.7 (in 2011) → 3.2 (in 2020) → 4.0 (in 
2035)
 - China (million tons): 105 (in 2011) → 245 (in 2020) → 422 (in 2035) (Annual growth rate of 6.0%)
 - India (million tons): 49 (in 2011) → 69 (in 2020) → 137 (in 2035) (Annual growth rate of 4.4%)
 - Brazil (million tons): 22 (in 2011) → 36 (in 2020) → 72 (in 2035) (Annual growth rate of 5.2%) 
• The increase in the unconventional gas supply from North America will lead to an increased 
supply of natural gas in the global market, contributing to diversifying the global supply, 
which has been disproportionately concentrated in the Middle East and Russia, and 
alleviating the price gap between regions. 
* Global natural gas production (billion tons) (the proportion of unconventional gas): (2011) 2.7 (17%)→
(2020) 3.2 (21%)→ (2035) 4.0 (27%)
• Global demand for LPG will grow gradually, driven especially by LPG for petrochemical 
feedstock and domestic and commercial LPG.
* Global LPG demand forecast (mb/d, IEA): 7.6 (2012) → 8.6 (2020) → 9.2 (2035) (Annual growth rate of 
0.8%) 
◎ Domestic supply and demand: Domestic demand for natural gas has steadily increased at 
an annual rate of 7.9% over the past 10 years due to expanded deployment of city gas and 
increased demand for generation and industrial use. 
* Domestic natural gas demand (million tons): 18.45 (2003) → 23.50 (2006) → 24.64 (2009) → 36.55 
(2012)
• In the mid- to long-term, the industrial and transport sectors will drive the increase in 
demand, while demand from the power generation sector will depend on GHG emission 
reduction targets, base load power reserve ratios, etc.
• The reserve ratio (storage capacity/annual demand), which is around 11% on average, must 
be continually increased to ensure a stable supply of natural gas in the domestic market 134 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
B. Direction
① Stable Supply
Stable supply of oil 
◎ In response to changes in the global gas market, such as the expansion of shale gas 
development, diversify natural gas and LPG import sources, and secure a stable and 
sufficient supply of gas
* Shale-based LNG from North America is planned to be imported to Korea from 2017 and LNG from 
2014. 
◎ Alleviate price risks related to oil price changes and enhance capability to develop and supply 
energy independently by linking gas field development, the construction and operation of 
liquefaction plants, and market deployment
* As of December 2013, KOGAS was involved in 7 LNG projects, including LNG Canada. 
◎ Enhance the foundation for international cooperation by strengthening cooperation between 
large gas importers in Asia, establishing consultative mechanisms with major energy 
producing countries, etc.
* Asia: Regularly hold Korea-Japan and Korea-China Gas Dialogues to enable collective action in 
response to major issues
 North America: Expand cooperation in the unconventional gas sector through the Canada-Korea 
Natural Gas Forum, Korea-U.S. workshops, etc.
◎ Diversify city gas supplies by establishing an institutional foundation to produce and deploy 
city gas other than biogas and other non-natural gases
Timely expansion of supply infrastructure 
◎ Expand LNG storage facilities in a timely manner in order to better respond to the high 
winter/low summer consumption pattern and ensure stable supply and demand in the midto long-term
* Secure an additional storage capacity of 3.21 million ㎘ (or 1.46 million tons) by 2018, backed by the 
completion of the Samcheok plant (2014), the construction of additional facilities in District 4 of the 
Incheon plant (2018), etc. SIX MAJOR TASKS 135
5. Establishment of a Stable Source-by-Source Supply System
* Encourage private sector investment in storage facilities (ton, as of Dec 2012): 230,000 (2013) →
500,000 (2017) (in total)
◎ Build additional main gas pipelines, along with new LNG plants, by 2017 to secure a timely 
supply of gas. In addition, construct gasification and transmission facilities and other supply 
infrastructure.
* Main natural gas pipelines: 3,558km (2012) → 4,928km (2027)
* Supply capacity of gasification and transmission facilities: 8,770 ton/hour (2012) → 14,099 ton/hour 
(2027)
Ensuring stable supply and demand management 
◎ Enhance the supply and demand management system and secure a sufficient supply of 
natural gas in advance in order to ensure a stable supply in the winter season when demand 
peaks 
• Launch a task force* to manage natural gas supply and demand in the winter season every 
year and respond quickly** at each stage of an emergency (attention-caution-warningcritical). 
* The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, KOGAS, Korea Power Exchange, Korea City Gas 
Association, etc. 
** Manage supply and demand, operate heavy oil or diesel standby generators, modify preventive 
maintenance plans, etc. 
◎ Expand deployment of natural gas air conditioning, which is effective for load management 
and for addressing the high winter/low summer consumption pattern of natural gas; and 
develop technology that improves the efficiency of natural gas air conditioning
• Improve the economic feasibility of and create new demand for natural gas air conditioning 
by providing support for installation, lowering import tariffs on natural gas*, requiring 
installation in large buildings, etc.
* A full refund for tariffs imposed on imported natural gas (24,242 won/ton) will be offered for 3 years 
from 2014 to 2016.
* From 2014, develop technology to improve the efficiency of GHP engines and triple-effect absorption 
chillers
◎ Implement a stockpiling system from August 2016 to stabilize the supply and demand of 
natural gas 136 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
* The size of the strategic stockpile should be determined based on analysis by research institutes of 
examples abroad
* Examples of the strategic stockpiling abroad: (Spain) Equal to 20 days of winter season demand, 
(Poland) Equal to 30 days of imports
Expanded deployment of city gas
◎ Strengthen the foundation of the city gas supply by expanding the main city gas pipeline, and 
promote the deployment of city gas through policy loans and other measures
• Increase the number of local governments providing city gas to 214 by 2017, and expand loan 
programs for projects to build pipelines in rural areas
* Number of local governments with city gas (out of a total of 230 local governments in Korea): 186 (2012) 
→ 207 (2015) → 214 (2017)
◎ Address the problem of a city gas blind spot in some regions by installing small LPG storage 
tanks and pipelines for people in energy poverty within those regions
* Eligibility for support: (Social welfare centers) 360 centers (2013) → 720 centers (2014) (all)
 (Rural areas) 9 areas will receive support under the pilot program in 2014, and the program will be 
extended to more areas in the future.
Improvement of price transparency and support for low income families
◎ Implement a pricing mechanism which links commodity prices to gas rates, reflecting 
factors that change the cost of gas ingredients. In addition, enhance the transparency and 
appropriateness of the pricing mechanism*
* Improve existing measures to strengthen the cost verification system. For example, design criteria 
to classify regulatory and non-regulatory projects and create an obligation to prepare financial 
statements for pricing purposes. Additionally, revise the criteria for calculating the supply price of 
natural gas.
◎ Realize inclusive welfare by maintaining the city gas tariffs discount program for beneficiaries 
of the Basic Livelihood Program*, the disabled, etc.
* As of December 2013, beneficiaries receive a discount of 12,400 won monthly, which is about 20% of 
their average monthly electricity costs.SIX MAJOR TASKS 137
5. Establishment of a Stable Source-by-Source Supply System
income families for cooking, heating, and transportation
② Improvement of the Industrial Structure
Rationalizing direct import regulations 
◎ Rationalize regulations on direct import by the private sector in order to contain potential 
inefficiency** caused by the natural gas monopoly system* and decrease the LNG import unit 
price 
* Korea is the only OECD member which maintains a monopoly system in the natural gas sector. 
** In November 2012, the International Energy Agency recommended that Korea introduce competition 
into the wholesale gas market for the benefit of consumers and the overall Korean economy. 
• Revise the Urban Gas Business Act to relax regulations on the sale and exchange of imports* 
to enable private-sector direct importers to manage supply and demand more efficiently
* Under current law, direct importers are allowed to sell directly-imported gas only to gas wholesalers 
or to exchange such gas with other direct importers or gas wholesalers. 
Laying an institutional framework for the LNG trading business
◎ Given the high potential of the Northeast Asian LNG market* and the expected expansion 
of the shale gas supply**, an institutional framework should be laid for the private sector to 
enter the LNG trading business.
* Northeast Asia is the largest LNG market in the world, importing 60% of the world’s LNG. The 
market is expected to enjoy continuous growth due to economic growth in China and increased gas 
generation in Japan.
** The full scale development and export of North American shale gas will bring an increased supply of 
LNG that is relatively cheap and has no restrictions on destination, thus making it easier to trade.
• Introduce an LNG import and export business system in which an LNG trading business 
makes use of LNG storage facilities within bonded areas in Korea (revision of the Urban Gas 
Business Act)
* Expected benefits include increased private sector investment in LNG terminals and job creation, 
increased tax revenue collected from profits generated in the trading business, and a large volume of 
gas imports in a short period of time138 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
A. Stable Supply 
◎ Enhancing the timely construction of power plants: Encourage the timely completion of 
power plants under construction and enhance the follow-up measures of power plant 
construction plans
• Encourage the completion of power plant construction on schedule with periodic process 
control and streamlined licensing procedures
◎ Building a system to regularize supply and demand: Minimize public inconvenience by 
expanding supply capacity as much as possible and taking systematic measures to reduce 
demand when unexpected supply disruptions occur
• In case of emergency, make full use of available generating resources to supply power, 
including power from private sector generators, standby generators of public agencies, and 
test-runs of generators in not-yet-completed power plants
• Transition from demand management that places direct restrictions on power consumption 
through regulations toward systematic, continuous demand management.
◎ Reinforcing a vulnerable power grid: Reinforce the power grid to contain damage in case of 
transmission line failure in regions where power plants are concentrated, such as the Seoul 
metropolitan area, and the western, southern, and eastern coastal areas.
• Increase the number of outgoing transmission lines for generated power, establish a plan to 
reinforce the back-up power system, and encourage the early completion of construction in 
order to improve the stability of the power grid
B. Improvement of the Industrial Structure
Direction 
◎ Target both stability and efficiency of power supply and demand, and maintain and enhance 
the power industry’s role as a public utility in such aspects as network neutrality and 
protection of marginalized people in society
* The current power industry uses a cost-based pool system in which regulations and competition exist 
side-by-side.SIX MAJOR TASKS 139
5. Establishment of a Stable Source-by-Source Supply System
management
Plan 
◎ Establish a Korean-style business model appropriate to the current status of the Korean 
power industry that gives comprehensive consideration to important changes in the power 
industry*. 
* The Fukushima accident, climate change, decreased public acceptance of nuclear power and 
transmission and distribution facilities, etc. 
• Find fundamental solutions through precise analysis and evaluation of the structure of the 
power industry, thorough discussion among industry experts, and a process to reach public 
consensus
◎ Enable demand reduction resources to be traded on the market by establishing an 
institutional framework, creating a variety of business models, and laying a foundation for 
commercialization
• Allow “smart-demand” resources to be traded on the market; provide ways for demand 
management companies in fields such as smart grid and ESS to participate in the power 
market, etc. 
◎ Undertake fundamental, systematic reform to stabilize the price of power and avoid excessive 
price increases in the case of major supply disruptions
• Introduce vesting contracts to build a foundation for securing a stable electricity supply and 
stable electricity prices, and enhance the legal basis for Soft Cap Price
4. Integrated Energy
A. Current Status 
◎ Necessity of diffusion: Integrated energy is key to achieving green growth at home and 
abroad as it contributes greatly to efficient energy use and reducing GHG emissions. 
* Energy efficiency of 26% and CO2 emission reduction of 35.5% annually on average as a share of 
production of heat and electricity140 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
◎ Domestic market conditions: Despite favorable conditions for the integrated energy 
business*, the deployment rate of district heating is expected to remain low due to the poor 
development of residential land and other reasons.
* Korea has even better conditions for introducing an integrated energy supply system than many 
advanced European countries, including an appropriate number of heating degree days (annual 
heating hours) and a high heat density (a high concentration of multi-family residential buildings).
◎ Changes in surrounding conditions: The importance of combined heat and power (CHP) 
plants as a tool to expand distributed power generation is rising as transmission lines 
become saturated due to high electricity demand from the metropolitan area. 
* Generation capacity shortage of approximately 7,000 MW for Seoul and 11,700 MW for Gyeonggi 
province
* Electricity shortage (consumption – production): Seoul (44,269 MWh), Gyeonggi province (71,923 
MWh) 
B. Direction
① Enhancing Distributed Power Generation
◎ Expanding CHP in the Seoul metropolitan area: Encourage the replacement of aged CHP* 
facilities and the construction of large-scale facilities in suburbs of the capital
• CHP plants with a capacity of 4,435 MW will be built in the metropolitan area by 2020. 
* Chuncheon POSCO E&C 422MW, Korea District Heating Corporation Hwaseong and DongtanⅡ
840MW CHP plant construction
◎ Encouraging the construction of large-scale plants: Give priority to large areas with heat 
loads of at least 100 Gcal/h (or 100 MW) when selecting locations for new plants
• Increase the weight of financial and technological capabilities in the new plant selection 
process, as these are good indicators of business sustainability 
• Reduce regulations on the ratio of heat to power and introduce efficiency standards when 
granting permission to build CHP plants
* The construction of large-scale CHP plants should be promoted by easing the ratio of heat to power.SIX MAJOR TASKS 141
5. Establishment of a Stable Source-by-Source Supply System
with prices for power generation and grant exemptions from oil import tariffs
• Since an integrated energy company is classified as electricity generation company according 
to Article 7 of the Electric Utility Act, the wholesale price of gas should be the same for CHP 
and for power generation. 
• To promote distributed power generation, offer a 3 year (2014-2016) refund of import tariffs 
(19.39won/m3) imposed on integrated energy supply, including community electricity
◎ Increasing the transparency of heating prices: Establish standards for accounting and 
calculating prices as well as a heating price verification system
• Establish by law accounting and cost calculating standards applicable to all market players 
and subject to external verification by a qualified institution
• Promote the development of affordable heat sources, energy conservation, and renewable 
energy investment by reforming the pricing system to provide incentives for demand side 
management, such as authorizing different levels of return on investment
③ Establishing a Basis for Sustainable Development 
◎ Expanded deployment of district cooling: Improve the profit structure of district cooling 
by providing more subsidies for deployment, enhancing user convenience, promoting 
development of technology for district cooling devices, etc.
• As a follow-up to the R&D and demonstration project on desiccant cooling for multi-family 
residential buildings that was completed in October 2013, supply district cooling on a trial 
basis to new homes planned to be sold 
◎ Enhancing the use of surplus heat and waste heat: Promote a shift to a low-cost structure by 
making better use of affordable heat, such as waste heat from industrial complexes
• Provide affordable heat to customers by improving the cost competitiveness of existing 
market players through the establishment of a heat network and comprehensive operation 
center for the Seoul metropolitan area
④ Protecting Consumer Rights 
◎ Introduction of an alternative heat supply system: Introduce an alternative heat supply 
system to prevent companies from becoming insolvent, carry out response measures and 
minimize user inconvenience142 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
and stops supplying gas.
• Regulations for heat suppliers will be revised and MOUs will be concluded between 
companies on a voluntary basis to strengthen the responsibility of companies and rights of 
consumers in case of heat supply failures.
◎ Implementation of an integrated welfare system: Consider measures to integrate the 
different welfare systems of companies and revise heat prices to reflect welfare costs
◎ Encouragement of public involvement: Encourage public participation by making it mandatory 
to collect opinions of residents when considering a permit for a heat source that exceeds the 
predetermined level
• Mandate that companies hold public hearings and information sessions when soliciting the 
opinions of local governments- Six Major Tasks - 6. Energy Policy Refl ecting 
Public Opinion
CHAPTER V144 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
■Address blind spots of the energy welfare system and shift towards a welfare system 
customized to fit the needs and consumption patterns of recipients
A. Current Status
◎ In 2005, a middle school student whose family’s power had been cut died in a fire started by 
a candle. Following her death, the Korea Energy Foundation was launched in 2006, and the 
government began full scale efforts to create a legal basis for energy welfare, including the 
Energy Act in 2006. 
• The First Energy Master Plan set a goal of reducing the number of energy poor to zero by 
2030. 
◎ An annual average of 3 million households received energy support totaling 1.8 trillion won 
during the last 5 years from 2008 to 2012. 
• More funds were made available for energy welfare by increasing the budget of the Energy 
Efficiency Improvement Project and beginning the heating oil provision program in 2012. 
Moreover, the electricity tariff system was revised from a fixed rate system to a flat rate 
system in order to better serve low-income families. 
① Facilities and products: Distribute renewable energy and improve efficiency by 
replacing obsolete boilers, installing insulation in homes, renovating doors and 
windows, etc.
 * Energy Efficiency Improvement Project: 19.5 billion won in 2011 → 31.1 billion won in 2012 (to 
be confirmed) 
② Heating bills: Provide heating oil (18,000 households, kerosene 200 l) and coal 
briquette coupons (83,000 households, 169,000 won)
③ Discounts on utilities: Provide discounts on electricity (8,000 won), gas (123.5 won/㎥) 
and heating costs (exemption from basic charges) 
④ Grace period: Postpone service cuts in case of overdue electricity and gas bills 
⑤ Energy safety: Provide emergency measures for the marginalized in case of power 
failure, improve the safety of gas facilities, etc. SIX MAJOR TASKS 145
6. Energy Policy Reflecting Public Opinion
* The term “energy poor” refers to households that spend more than 10% of their income on lighting 
and heating. The number of energy poor households has risen from 1.2 million in 2008 to 1.78 million 
in 2011 (estimated). 
B. Problems
Blind spots in energy welfare support
◎ Low-income families that are not eligible for the Basic Livelihood Program, including those 
in the second lowest income bracket*, face difficulties similar to those of the Basic Livelihood 
Program beneficiaries, such as limited access to electricity and heating. However, they 
receive relatively inadequate support.
* A family whose income is under 120% of the minimum cost of living and is ineligible for the program. 
Uniform method of calculating heating and lighting expenditures
◎ During the winter, average energy spending more than doubles, and the proportion of 
families living in energy poverty rises significantly (8.9% in November → 26% in February).

Unbalanced welfare support across energy sources 
◎ Although expensive energy sources, such as kerosene and LPG, make up a large share* 
of the energy use of low income families, such families are often ineligible for discount 
programs. 
* The primary heating fuel of the energy poor: gas (45%), kerosene (36%), central heating (7.5%), etc.146 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
Electricity Only Gas Only Both (Total) Excluded From 
Discounts
35.2% 5.1% 31.2% 71.6% 28.4%
◎ Because the support system is centered around network energy sources, such as gas and 
electricity, it has brought more benefits to homes with higher heating efficiency.
C. Direction
Vision 
■ Establish a tailored welfare system which links together the Energy Voucher Program, 
energy bill discount programs and energy efficiency programs.

6. Energy Policy Reflecting Public Opinion
◎ Direction: Devise and support an integrated payment method for energy purchases by 
integrating various sporadic energy assistance programs
• Practical support: Provide practical subsidies in consideration of actual energy consumption 
patterns
* Take into account various factors, including seasonal needs and the presence of disadvantaged family 
members
• Consideration of seasonal factors: Subsidize the energy spending of low-income families 
during times of cold weather
• Minimization of blind spots: Strengthen support for low-income families ineligible for the 
Basic Livelihood Program, including those in the second lowest income bracket
◎ Support plan: Introduce an Energy Voucher Program, which enables the purchase of various 
types of energy, including electricity, gas and kerosene, in order to ease the energy burden 
on low-income families during the winter season
* Eligibility will include all Basic Livelihood Program beneficiaries as well as the disabled, the elderly 
and families with young children in the second lowest income bracket.
Revision of the Energy Efficiency Improvement Project
◎ Energy welfare analysis project: Launch an energy welfare analysis project using expert 
analysis based on on-site inspection of the status of households or agencies currently 
receiving energy assistance
* An analysis team will be formed under the Korea Energy Foundation to provide advice on aspects that 
need improvement and design support plans.
◎ Support for improving efficiency: Based on the results of consultations, produce an optimal 
mix of energy infrastructure for each household and provide support packages for replacing 
lighting, insulation, boilers, etc.
* Under the present system, support for improving lighting, insulation, and boilers is provided 
separately by different agencies. 
Expansion of energy welfare infrastructure
◎ Creating an energy welfare database: Collect district-by-district information from welfare 
recipients on energy sources in use, usage amount, and dwelling type, and establish a 148 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
* An integrated database which provides comprehensive data and analysis of each agency’s recipient 
information will be established. 
◎ Establishing an agency dedicated to energy welfare: Provide a legal basis for an agency 
dedicated to energy welfare
* New provisions recognizing energy welfare as a basic human right should be added to relevant laws 
when they are revised. 
◎ Promoting public participation: Build a stronger foundation for energy welfare and expand 
social monitoring of project implementation through energy welfare projects in which the 
general public* can participate
* A program which links energy conservation to the welfare system should be implemented. Under 
this program, a person who has surplus energy from reducing energy consumption will be able to 
select eligible entities (households or facilities) to which he/she may donate, and he/she will be able 
to follow how the donated energy is being used. 
2. Expansion of Local Government Participation
■Improve the efficiency of policy implementation by establishing regional energy governance 
in which local governments, which have direct contact with the public and businesses, play a 
leading role
■Delegate the planning and implementation of energy projects to local governments in order to 
reflect local needs and conditions
A. Progress
◎ Regional energy projects have been implemented since the mid-1990s. The deployment 
of renewable energy has been carried out on the supply side, while energy-efficient device 
deployment projects have been carried out on the demand side. 
• Supply: The regional energy self-sufficiency rate has been improved through renewable 
energy deployment projects. 
* Financial support: The total amount of support increased from 120 million won in 1996 to 721.6 billion 
won in 2013. SIX MAJOR TASKS 149
6. Energy Policy Reflecting Public Opinion
was estimated to be approximately 15.5%.
* Financial support: The total amount of financial support for demand management increased from 
880 million won in 1996 to 238.1 billion won in 2013.
B. Limitations
◎ Governance: There is insufficient organization, manpower, legal institutions and other 
infrastructure needed for policy implementation.
• Only approximately 10% of local governments have a well-established implementation 
system, such as the Basic Energy Ordinance (28 out of 230 local governments). 
• The implementation of energy policies is assigned to a number of different teams, including 
construction, industry, transportation, climate change and environment teams. Moreover, 
the role of the private-public National Energy Committee* is limited. 
* The National Energy Committee consists of and is run by local governments, local assemblies, 
research institutes, civil groups, and other participants to advise, deliberate on and coordinate energy 
policy in accordance with the Basic Energy Ordinance.
◎ Policy Design: Local governments have not been able to fully participate in the central 
government’s policy-making process, meaning that the division of roles between the central 
and local governments and coordination across policies have been insufficient*. 
* The Regional Energy Plan and the Energy Master Plan, which are required by law, are not 
coordinated with each other. In addition, since most of the authority for carrying out the plans belongs 
to the central government, local governments lack policy tools. 
• Although local governments are obliged to annually set out Action Plans for Energy Use 
Rationalization, such Action Plans are rarely implemented and are carried out only at the 
public agency level. 
◎ Project implementation: For energy conservation projects, a high reliance on central 
government subsidies has resulted in decreased project development efforts as the share of 
government support fell from 70-100% to 50%. 
* The amount of subsidies applied for by local governments (in billion won): 194.7 (2011) → 194.1 (2012) 
→ 122.5 (2013) → 95.6 (2014) 
• Policies and programs planned by local governments are too few and tend to be short-term, 
yearly plans whose purpose and size change every year. 150 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
projects have been concentrated in solar PV, which is easy to install. 
* Solar PV projects received 70.4% of regional renewable energy deployment program funds. 
C. Main Tasks
① Establishment of Regional Energy Governance
◎ Enhancing the legal basis: Encourage lower-level local governments to establish their own 
Regional Energy Ordinances and promote the implementation of policies which can improve 
the effectiveness of such Ordinances
• Upper-level local governments should hold regular Energy Committee meetings, and lowerlevel local governments should create Committees on Energy Conservation Practices and 
focus on specific demand management efforts. 
■Energy Committee: Responsible for the development and evaluation of basic energy 
management policies, deliberation on Regional Energy Plans, preparation of private-public 
cooperation measures, deliberation on restrictions imposed on the energy consumption of 
facilities and individuals, etc.
■Committee on Energy Conservation Practices: Responsible for discussion of measures 
to promote energy conservation practices, evaluation of energy conservation policies and 
performance, development and assessment of alternative energy projects, including solar PV 
and geothermal, etc. 
◎ Strengthening the role of policy: Design Regional Energy Plans which reflect regional 
conditions and priorities
• Guarantee the autonomy of local governments by replacing the existing approach, in which 
individual energy projects are assigned to local governments, with a new approach, in which 
each local government forms its own energy project portfolioSIX MAJOR TASKS 151

projects to systematic projects* in order to improve the effectiveness of regional energy 
conservation projects 
* Priority will be placed on supporting generation and heat supply facilities using waste heat from 
incinerators, cooling and heating systems using treated wastewater or sea water, EMSs of buildings 
and factories, etc. 
• Local governments should implement projects to replace high-energy-consuming products 
with energy-efficient products that have high economic feasibility using ESCO, project 
financing, and policy loans. 
◎ Renewable energy: Create local government-led Renewable Energy Towns in consortium 
with local governments, citizens, research institutes, etc. 
* Consortium: Project plan design, installation, and maintenance 
 Government: Project selection, monitoring, etc.
③ Establishment of a Foundation for Regional Energy Policy 
◎ Infrastructure: Create a system that supports energy statistics and demand management 
programs* of local governments
* A support system includes the following: analysis and projection of changes in energy consumption 
patterns, energy conservation effects of each demand management program, economic feasibility 
assessments, monitoring of policy impacts, etc. 
◎ Promotion of public participation: Use private-public partnerships to establish a governance 
structure focused on sector-specific demand management ranging from households to 
buildings and transportation
• Set energy reduction targets based on detailed data at the local government and community 
levels, assign roles to major players, and develop programs.
Examples of regional energy project implementation that involves the public 
■ Establish energy conservation targets and detailed plans for implementation based 
on apartment building-specific surveys of power usage, number of households, and 
number of residents per household
■ In carrying out the Energy Efficiency Improvement Project for residential buildings, 
establish a governance system for each topic and issue. For example, forge a 
partnership that consists of residents, construction companies, assessment 
companies, and civic groups.SIX MAJOR TASKS 153
6. Energy Policy Reflecting Public Opinion
■Shift priority from reacting to conflicts, including settlement and mediation, to proactive 
response, such as prevention
A. Direction
Establishment of conflict control principles 
◎ Analyze cases which occur repeatedly and devise response measures in consideration of 
stakeholders, factors causing conflicts, past solutions, etc.
◎ Find optimal solutions by referring to overseas examples and the results of conflict resolution 
measures taken by conflict management experts, governments, public energy enterprises, 
etc.
• Address the root causes of conflicts by improving laws and institutions
Proactive response
◎ Identify factors that can trigger conflicts in advance and monitor such factors consistently, 
considering capital investment plans of public enterprises, past conflicts, values of residents, 
etc.
• Conduct impact analysis in advance for conflicts with potential to spread and, if necessary, 
introduce such conflicts to Conflict Management Committees as priority agenda
◎ For priority agenda items, set future plans based on the Conflict Management Manual and 
periodically examine and manage such plans
• Before implementing policies, minimize factors that can trigger conflicts by providing 
stakeholders, in particular, with opportunities to be involved in the policy-making process
* An impartial conflict mediation council consisting of equal numbers of companies, people who filed 
civil complaints, and professional mediators will be launched. 
• Develop compensation and support policies giving consideration to a variety of factors, 
including national financial conditions, general public acceptance, and damage caused to the 
region in question154 KOREA ENERGY MASTER PLAN
Construction of transmission lines
◎ Maximize the use of existing transmission lines and, in cases where building high-voltage 
transmission lines is unavoidable, take various measures to improve public acceptance
• Conduct conflict assessment for areas where construction is planned in order to develop 
measures for minimizing conflict with local residents in advance
* Conflict assessment will be conducted for the Saemangeum transmission line construction project. 
• Plan and carry out measures to provide reasonable compensation for falling property values 
near planned transmission lines
Nuclear energy policy
◎ Organize a Steering Committee for each regional headquarters to decide issues related to 
local residents, such as regional support
* Example: Heads of nuclear power plant headquarters, heads of Guns (or counties), Chairs of Gun 
assemblies, environmental watch groups, regional organizations, non-governmental experts, etc. 
◎ When a major issue arises relating to nuclear power plants, hold a briefing session about the 
issue and facilitate information exchange with citizens with the help of non-governmental 
environmental watch groups. Moreover, promote resident participation in inspection and 
monitoring.
* Information reported to regulatory authorities, information on planned preventive maintenance and 
failure/shutdown, relevant briefing sessions, frequent information sharing on nuclear power plant 
operations, etc.
◎ Promote resident participation in decisions on support projects in a nuclear plant area and 
shift to projects which provide high satisfaction to residents
* Enhance the resident participation process when making decisions on electricity subsidies, medical 
services, training programs, etc.Future Plans
