 MESSAGE FROM THE SECRETARY
Addressing the conditions of high economic growth, volatile 
energy prices and growing environment concerns, the the 
Department of Energy (DOE) is honored to be the vanguard in 
formulating policies and plans that will ensure adequate and 
reliable supply of energy in all aspects of development. Toward 
this end, the DOE envisions a scenario of energy diversification,
highlighting the deployment of clean energy and demand side 
management leading to a low carbon future. 
The Department also looks after the continuity of energy 
programs to sustain the progress of achieving its plans and 
programs to complement the current energy situation, even 
though institutional changes occur in the energy sector. Thus, at 
the onset of the Aquino Administration in 2010, the DOE initially 
crafted the Energy Reform Agenda (ERA) with the guiding vision 
of providing “Energy access for more” in an environment of transparency and good governance. 
The ERA is anchored on the overall goals of ensuring energy security, achieving optimal energy 
pricing and developing a sustainable energy system. Beyond ERA, the Department formulated the 
Philippine Energy Plan 2012-2030 to support the long-term transformation of the country’s energy 
future towards sustainable development. 
The PEP 2012-2030 embodies the country’s major plans and programs, the prudent assessment 
of energy trends and development, as well as the action agenda to respond to emerging and 
foreseen energy challenges and issues within the planning period. Strategies are defined to address
significant challenges such as continued vulnerability to energy supply disruptions, volatility of oil
prices in the world market and mitigating environmental consequences. The Plan focuses on the 
ramped-up development of renewable energy, accelerated indigenous energy resource exploration, 
diversification of energy supply sources, promotion of energy efficiency and the full implementation
of electricity market reforms that is expected to give millions of Filipinos the Power of Choice. 
With the increasing concern on energy security attributed to the inevitably growing energy 
appetite among nations, it is incumbent upon us to plan ahead with keen foresight taking into 
account innovations in energy technologies, regional and international developments and 
contingencies such as climate change impacts and disaster preparedness and management. Yet, we 
emphasized that the energy challenge is not just for government alone to solve. We need enhanced 
cooperation and coordinated efforts among private and public sectors, civil society, academe and 
the international community. More than ever, the country is counting on every one to play an 
equally important role to pursue our strategic vision of providing a sustainable energy future for 
the present and future generations of Filipinos to come.
 
MESSAGE FROM THE SENATOR
In creating an enabling environment towards the country’s 
viable and sustainable development, it is crucial that government 
improves the country’s access to energy. With the possibility of 
energy shortages in the coming years, the consequences of not 
taking actions to address potential supply shortfalls would expose 
consumers and businesses to unacceptable risks, posing a big 
challenge to the country’s fragile economy. 
Thus, efforts are on-ground to provide a healthy mix of renewable 
energy and conventional fuels in the country’s primary energy mix. 
This will signal the country’s readiness to support its economic 
platform in the long-term.
Likewise, government is mandated to develop and establish 
ambitious long term energy goals that will ensure accessibility and 
availability of energy supply over the next 20 years. Thus, the Philippine Energy Plan 2012-2030 
was launched to serve as the roadmap for a dramatic scaling up of country’s energy plans and 
programs to meet today’s urgent energy challenges. The Plan ensures the optimum development 
and use of the country’s clean and alternative fuels, alongside the conventional energy resources 
that remain indispensable in meeting the country’s energy independence goal. 
We in Congress believe that close collaboration between government and the private sector will 
provide the necessary impetus in harnessing the country’s energy resources. Said partnership 
should pursue innovations in energy technologies, diversification and expansion of energy
production, promotion of environmental and safety consciousness, as well as promotion of social 
welfare of the Filipinos. 
Despite the challenges ahead, through renewed zeal and dedication of everyone, we can propel our 
country to even greater heights. Mabuhay!

Guided by the overall vision of providing “Energy Access for More,” the 2012-2030 Philippine Energy 
Plan (PEP) seeks to mainstream access of the larger populace to reliable and affordable energy 
services to fuel, most importantly, local productivity and countryside development. The energy 
sector, mindful of its role in promoting better quality of life for the Filipino people, will ensure 
the delivery of secure, sustainable, sufficient, affordable and environment-friendly energy
t
o all
economic sectors. In pursuit of this goal, the government will mobilize private sector participation 
and involvement of other stakeholders to make power of choice a reality. 
The 2012-2030 PEP is crafted with due 
consideration and premium on the economic 
parameters sourced from the National 
Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), 
Development Budget Coordination Committee 
(DBCC), National Statistics Office (NSO) and
international references on energy such as 
the World Energy Outlook of the International 
Energy Agency (IEA). For the medium-term, 
the 2012-2030 PEP is basically anchored on 
the policy framework set in place with the 
formulation of the Energy Reform Agenda 
(ERA). The ERA is consistent with national 
development directives such as the President’s 
Social Contract and the 2011-2016 Philippine 
Development Plan; and, responsive to long-term 
(beyond 2016) global policy frameworks on 
energy such as the UN Sustainable Energy for 
All Initiative and the APEC Green Growth Goals. 
ENERGY REFORM AGENDA
The ERA has outlined the 
following major pillars 
as its overall guidepost 
and direction: (a) Ensure 
energy security through the 
development of indigenous 
energy such as renewable 
energy and hydrocarbon 
fuels (oil, gas, and coal); 
(b) Achieve optimal energy 
pricing in electricity and oil; 
and, (c) Develop a sustainable 
energy system through the 
formulation and update of 
national plans and programs 
on energy development, which are consistent 
with the country’s economic development plans. • The President’s Social Contract 
The PEP is guided by the President’s 
Social Contract with the Filipinos. The 
plans and programs of PEP are responsive 
to the Social Contract’s pillars: a) Anticorruption/ transparent, accountable and 
participatory governance through our 
energy contracting rounds, Information, 
Education and Communication (IEC) 
and public consultation activities; b) 
Poverty reduction and empowerment of 
the poor through our programs on rural 
electrification, energy efficiency and
conservation, and the provision of benefits to host communities; c) Rapid, inclusive 
and sustained economic growth through 
basically all our programs especially in improving the supply of energy products 
and services (both oil and electricity) 
nationwide to fuel the businesses and 
spur countryside development; d) Just and 
lasting peace and the rule of law starting 
with the efforts of the Department of Energy 
(DOE) in developing regional energy plans 
such as the Mindanao Energy Plan (MEP) 
to serve as the region’s energy roadmap; e) 
Integrity of the Environment and Climate 
Change Mitigation and Adaptation with our 
accelerated programs on energy efficiency,
renewable energy and alternative fuels; and, 
f) Gender Development, which is integrated 
in relevant plans and programs. 
• Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 
2011-2016
The energy sector contributes to the 
PDP’s goals of promoting inclusive 
growth and poverty reduction. The PEP 
programs on ensuring energy supply 
security and providing energization to the 
countryside are integral components of 
the national infrastructure development 
agenda as contained in the PDP. These 
energy commitments will support the 
PDP’s targeted outcomes of enhancing 
the country’s competitiveness, reducing 
gaps in basic services, and improving 
environmental quality. 
• UN Sustainable Energy For All Initiative 
Development 
Cognizant of the fact that the energy sector 
is the biggest contributor of greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions, accounting for about 49.0
percent of the world’s total, the PEP contains 
the policies, plans and programs that will 
significantly contribute to the country’s
transition towards a low carbon economy – 
an economy that generates minimal output 
of GHG emissions into the biosphere. 
In December 2010, the United Nations 
General Assembly declared the year 2012 
as the International Year of Sustainable 
Energy for all. This global initiative engages 
the support of all governments, the private 
sector and civil society in ensuring universal 
access to modern energy services, double the 
global rate of energy efficiency by reducing
energy use (14.0 percent) in 2030, double 
the share of and/or increase the share of 
renewable energy in the global energy mix 
from the current share of 15.0 percent. 
• ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy 
Cooperation (APAEC) 2010-2015
The PEP supports and contributes to 
the regional action plans and targets as 
espoused in APAEC 2010-2015. APAEC
is the regional framework of energy 
cooperation highlighting the role of energy 
under the ASEAN Economic Community 
Blueprint 2015. It aims to enhance regional
energy security and sustainability through 
aggressive implementation of action plans 
of the different program components – 
(1) ASEAN Power Grid; (2) Trans-ASEAN 
Gas Pipeline; (3) Coal and Clean Coal 
Technology; (4) Renewable Energy; (5)
Energy Efficiency and Conservation; (6)
Regional Energy Policy and Planning; and, 
(7) Civilian Nuclear Energy. 
Among the regional targets set in APAEC 
to be achieved in 2015 are: (a) 8.0 percent
(aggregate) energy intensity reduction 
based on 2005 level; and (b) increase share
of renewable energy resources to total 
installed power generating capacity of the 
region by 15.0 percent. 
• Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
(APEC) Green Growth 
This Plan also adheres to the APEC Green 
Growth Goals which include the following: 
a) rationalization/phase out of inefficient
fossil-fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful 
consumption; b) reduction of aggregate 
(regional) energy intensity by 25.0 percent
in 2030 and 45.0 percent in 2035 (based on
2005 level) as aspirational goal; c) promote
energy efficiency; and, d) incorporate
low-emissions development strategies to 
economic development plans, among others.
To contribute to the attainment of these broad 
policy and program frameworks, the DOE will 
work on ensuring the implementation of the 
following plans and programs:
A. Power Sector Development 
The development plans on power systems, 
transmission highways, distribution facilities 
and missionary electrification provide the
platform to put in place long-term reliable power 
supply, improve the country’s transmission and 
distribution systems and attain nationwide 
electrification. Specifically,thePEPhighlightsthe
implementation of critical power infrastructures 
to address possible power outages. Based on the 
Plan, the government will concentrate its efforts 
on the completion of committed power projects, 
as well as attract local and foreign investors 
to venture into indicative and potential power 
projects to include electrification projects.
B. Fuelling Sustainable Transport Program
As one of the biggest user of energy, the energy 
sector is mainly concerned on other alternative 
options to fuel the transport sector. Thus, 
the PEP will pursue the implementation of the 
Fueling Sustainable Transport Program (FSTP) 
which seeks to convert public and private 
vehicles from diesel and gasoline to compressed 
natural gas (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas
(LPG) and electric power. Under the program, 
CNG buses are envisioned to ply throughout 
the country. It also includes the promotion of 
electric vehicles for public transport and the 
increase in biofuels blends to 20.0 percent.
With the FSTP, the government hopes to reduce 
the carbon footprint from road transport in 
the Philippines. It has been estimated that 
road transportation accounts for around 50.0
percent of the total air pollutants in the country.
C. Indigenous Energy Development Program
As energy demand is anticipated to grow 
significantly over the indicated planning period,
it is incumbent for the energy sector to pursue 
all means to develop the country’s indigenous 
resources. In view of this, the Plan looks into a 
highly diverse energy mix to fuel the Philippine 
economy within the planning period. Even with 
the dawning of renewable energy development, 
the DOE recognizes the fact that the country 
will remain dependent on conventional fuels 
for many years to come to address its growing 
energy requirements. The Plan programs the 
conduct of energy contracting rounds as an 
effective strategy to bring in critical investments 
for the exploration, development and production 
of local energy resources. 
D. National Renewable Energy Plan
With the global trend towards a clean energy 
future, the Renewable Energy Act was passed in 
2008 to fully harness the country’s renewable 
energy potential such as geothermal, hydro, 
wind, solar, biomass and ocean. To guide the 
full implementation of the law, the National 
Renewable Energy Program (NREP) was 
launched on 14 June 2011 by President Aquino. 
The PEP includes the targets set under the NREP to 
strengthen its energy security plan. Specifically,
the NREP seeks to increase the country’s 
renewable energy-based capacity by 2030. 
E. Energy Efficiency and Conservation Program
With the escalating prices of imported fuels, the 
call for energy efficiency and conservation has
graduated from merely just a personal virtue to 
that of a national commitment. The PEP includes 
the National Energy Efficiency and Conservation
Program (NEECP) as one of the centerpiece 
strategies in pursuing energy security of the 
country and looks into it as a major solution to 
the energy challenges of the future. To lay the 
groundwork for a national energy efficiency
plan, the PEP recognizes the need for an energy 
conservation law as a critical measure in 
managing the country’s energy demandThe proposed legislation aims to incorporate policies 
and measures to develop local energy auditors 
and energy managers, establish the ESCO 
industry, encourage the development of energy 
efficient technologies and provide incentives for
the effective promotion of efficiency initiatives
in the energy market sector. 
F. Natural Gas Masterplan 
A complementary initiative to ensure the 
country’s energy security is the review 
and update of the Master Plan Study for the 
Development of the Natural Gas Industry 
in the Philippines. Said update includes an 
evaluation of the natural gas infrastructure 
requirements in the Visayas and Mindanao 
regions in view of the DOE’s plan to implement 
a Natural Gas Infrastructure Development 
Plan in these regions. The Masterplan, with 
technical assistance from Japan International 
Cooperation Agency (JICA) and World 
Bank, evaluates the opportunities, critical 
infrastructures and required investments for 
the development of the natural gas industry. 
ENERGY SECTOR’S PERFORMANCE
The 2012-2030 PEP provides the big picture 
on how the energy sector will proceed towards 
meeting its goals and mandate. The main 
chapters of the Plan highlights the 2011 vis-avis 2010 accomplishments of the energy sector. 
And to provide a more updated assessment, 
specified below are major achievements for the
period 2011 to 2012. 
• There was an increase in primary energy 
supply of 7.8 percent from 39.4 Million Ton 
of Oil Equivalent (MTOE) in 2011 to 42.9 
MTOE in 2012. However, the country’s
energy self-sufficiency level in 2012
declined to 56.3 percent from previous year
level of 59.6 percent. Such reduction was
attributed to a decreased share of natural 
gas and an increased importation of oil to 
meet the increasing domestic requirement 
specifically for the transport sector.
Crude oil importation dropped by 6.7 
percent from 69.61 million barrels (MMB) 
in 2011 to 64.94 MMB in 2012. Of the total 
imports, around 79.4 percent was sourced 
from the Middle East, bulk of which or 45.9
percent came from Saudi Arabia. On the 
other hand, finished petroleum product
imports posted an increase of 18.9 percent 
or 54.75 MMB from 46.06 MMB in 2011.
Diesel fuel exhibited the largest growth at 
35.7 percent. 
Local refinery production decreased by
10.5 percent from 67.37 MMB in 2011 to
60.29 MMB in 2012. This was due to the 
maintenance shutdown of the two (2) 
refineries. Average refining output in 2012
stood at 164.7 thousand barrels (MB) per 
day compared with 184.6 MB per day in the 
previous year.
The country’s demand for petroleum 
products went up by 4.0 percent to 111.0 
MMB from 106.32 MMB in 2011. This 
could be translated to an average daily 
requirement of 303.3 MB, higher than 
previous year’s level of 291.3 MB.
• The power sector has always played a key 
role in driving the country’s economy. Its 
stability and reliability are always of interest 
for a country that has an increasing trend 
with respect to its power demand.
Installed Capacity
Total installed capacity of the country increased 
by 6.0 percent in 2012 to 17,025.0 megawatts
(MW) from the 2011 level of 16,226.9 MW. 
Among the major island grids, Luzon registered 
the biggest increase in installed capacity at 5.4
percent from 11,811.1 MW in 2011 to 12,527.8
MW in 2012. For the same periods, dependable 
capacity of the grid likewise increased by 4.8 
percent from 10,824.4 MW to 11,348.7 MW. 
Said increase was attributed to the commercial 
operations of 651.6 MW coal power plant of GN
Power, the 21.3 MW CIP II diesel power plant, 
and the 19.8 MW Green Future and 1.2 MW 
Pangea biomass power plants. The uprating of 
Binga Hydro Electric Power Plant from 100 MW
to 125 MW also contributed to the increase.
In the Visayas, installed capacity stood at 2,448.0 
MW, an increase of only 2.3 percent from 2011 
level of 2,393.8 MW. Meanwhile, the dependable 
capacity went up by 3.3 percent from 2,036.8 
MW in 2011 to 2,103.3 MW in 2012.
In Mindanao, ensuring enough power supply 
remained a major challenge with the island 
grid’s ever growing demand and with not 
much additional capacity coming in. In 2012, 
installed capacity was recorded at 2,049.3 MW 
with minimal increase of 27 MW in capacity 
from previous year level of 2,022.0 MW. The 
additional capacity was due to the commercial 
operations of 3.2 MW King Energy (oil-based 
power plant), the 9.2 MW Cabulig Hydro Electric
Power Plant, and the capacity expansion of 
Crystal Sugar (biomass) from 21 MW to 35.9
MW. 
The government also came up with immediate 
and short-term measures to address the 
capacity gap in Mindanao. One of the solutions 
considered was the re-commissioning of the 
Iligan Diesel Power Plant which has a rated 
capacity of 100 MW. 
The other immediate measures that the 
government considered to address the shortterm supply gap were:
• Interruptible Load Program (ILP). Designed 
to entice greater participation from the 
different distribution utilities (DUs) with 
embedded generating capacities or those 
large users within their franchise areas 
having backup generating capacities to 
utilize such capacities. Under this program, 
the DUs with approved Energy Regulatory 
Commission (ERC) power rates will operate 
their embedded generating capacities, 
while the large users running their backup 
generator sets will be paid by the DU within 
its franchise area. The reduction of the 
power load requirements of the DUs with 
embedded generator will be transferred to 
other DUs requiring additional supply. 
 
• Interim Mindanao Electricity Market 
(IMEM). The establishment of an electricity 
market in Mindanao is seen as a mechanism 
to provide for a central dispatch and price 
for available capacities. Transaction in the 
IMEM will only be undertaken during supply 
shortfall. Power generating companies with 
uncontracted capacities as well as DUs 
and large users with available embedded 
generating capacities may nominate/bid 
to the IMEM their available capacities for 
dispatch at approved bid price.
It is expected that starting second half 
of 2014 onwards to 2015 and 2016, new
capacities from committed power projects 
will be on commercial operation to provide 
the needed power supply requirement of the 
grid. 
• Power Generation. Gross electricity 
generation in 2012 went up by 5.4 percent
from previous year’s level of 69,175.7
gigawatt-hours (GWh) to 72,299 GWh. 
Luzon grid generation posted an increase 
of 4.6 percent, while Visayas demonstrated 
a huge increase of almost 10.0 percent 
(15.0 percent in 2011) due to the 610 MW
additional capacities from coal-fired power
plants to the grid. On the other hand, 
despite experiencing suppressed demand 
from capacity constraints, the Mindanao 
grid exhibited 4.9 percent improvement 
in generation which was attributed to the 
relatively stable hydro facilities and from 
contribution of biomass-based power plant. 
Generation from oil-based power plants also 
expanded on the same year. 
The country’s total generation from oilbased power plants accelerated by 25.2percent from 3,397.6 GWh in 2011 to 4,254.0
GWh in 2012. The increase in generation 
was evident in Luzon grid with 39.5 percent,
followed by Mindanao with 20.8 percent and 
Visayas with only 7.5 percent. Oil-based
power plants were frequently dispatched in 
Luzon to provide additional supply in view 
of the planned outage of the 612-MW (block 
A) Ilijan Natural Gas Plant for about a month 
and to meet supply requirement during 
summer months. On the other hand, to 
reduce supply constraints in the Mindanao 
grid, generation from oil-based power plants 
was expanded. 
With additional generating capacity, 
generation from coal increased by 11.5
percent from 25,342.2 GWh in 2011
to 28,264.9 GWh in 2012. Meanwhile, 
generation from natural gas dropped by 
4.6 percent in 2012 from 20,591.3 GWh
in 2011 to 19,641.5 GWh. The decrease
was attributed to supply restriction from 
Malampaya as a result of maintenance 
shutdown in mid- July 2012, and the nonoperation of Ilijan Natural Gas Power Plant 
due to scheduled outage on 18 November–18 
December 2012. Contribution from 
geothermal power plants improved by 3.1 
percent, providing 10,250 GWh in 2012
from previous year’s level of 9,942.3 GWh. 
This was despite the decommissioning of 
the 49-MW Northern Negros Geothermal 
Power Plant, On the other hand, generation 
from hydroelectric power plants registered 
an increase of 5.7 percent from 9,697.5 GWh
in 2011 to 10,252.1 GWh in 2012. Such
came from an increase in generation in the 
Luzon grid by 9.4 percent with the uprating 
of Binga Hydroelectric Power Plant from
100 MW to 125 MW, and Mindanao grid
by 2.2 percent with the commissioning of 
Cabulig Hydroelectric Power Plant. Higher
and relatively stable water level during rainy 
months contributed to increased generation. 
Other renewable energy combined 
generation, such as wind, solar and biomass, 
likewise rose by 26.8 contributing 250.5
GWh. However, their combined share only
stood at 0.36 percent to the total generation. 
The significant increase was driven by
the biomass generation with additional 
capacities from the commercial operation of 
19.8-MW Green Future, 1.2-MW Pangea in 
Luzon and the capacity expansion of Crystal 
Sugar in Mindanao. 
• The overall barangay electrification level
in 2012 stood at 99.99 percent with only 
six (6) remaining to be unenergized. These 
barangays are located in the Autonomous 
Region for Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), 
specifically in the province of Maguindanao.
Further to the goal of increasing electricity 
access, the government also focused its 
electrificationinitiatives tocoverhouseholds
as well as sitios. It is envisioned that 90.0 
percent household electrification by 2017
and 100.0 percent sitio electrification by
2015 will be achieved.
As of 2012, household electrification stood
at 76.69 percent1
 with 16,114,213 out of 
1 Household and sitio electrification level is based on NEA’s 
December 2012 Energization Status. The figure for HH 
only reflects those covered by electric cooperatives (ECs) 
and does not include those covered by private DUs
21,010,890 households already provided 
with electricity. 
In the case of sitios, 87,474 out of the 
122,983 potential sitios had access to 
electricity posting electrification level at
71.13 percent.
• Missionary electrification is one of the
major undertakings in the power sector. 
The Qualified Third Party (QTP) program
is implemented to open unviable areas 
for private sector investment and provide 
integrated generation and distribution 
electric services to households without 
access to power. In December 2012, 
Powersource Philippines, the first QTP
project in Barangay Rio Tuba, Bataraza 
in Palawan installed and commissioned 
a biomass gasifier system and began
operating eight (8) hours per day. Evaluation 
of the second QTP application by the same 
energy company has been completed for 
the Malapascua Island, Daan Bantayan in 
Cebu. The project will be providing 24/7 
electricity services to about 800 households 
in the island. 
Ongoing coordination has been conducted 
for the third QTP project under the Semirara 
Mining Corporation. The project is expected 
to provide electricity to about 3,884 
households in three (3) barangays in the 
island. 
• Crude oil production in 2012 stood at 1.64 
MMB, 90.5 percent of which came from the
Galoc Field (producing about 1.48 MMB for 
the year). On the other hand, natural gas 
production from Malampaya for the same 
year stood at 134.56 BCF with associated
condensate of about 4.75 MMB. 
During the 4th Philippine Energy 
Contracting Round (PECR) held in June 
2011, the DOE received 20 bid proposals for 
petroleum exploration from the 15 offered
areas. Of the 20 bid proposals, five (5) have
been recommended for approval. Currently, 
the DOE is monitoring and supervising 27 
Petroleum Service Contracts.
• Considering that coal remains to be a leading 
contributor to the country’s energy supply, 
the government continues to optimize the 
exploration, development, production and 
utilization of indigenous coal reserves. In 
2012, indigenous coal production (run-ofmine) was recorded at 7.4 million metric 
tons (MMMT). Of the total coal production, 
Semirara Mining Corporation provided the 
largest share of about 7.0 MMMT or 95.0
percent. 
Following the launching of PECR 4 for 
coal in December 2011 which offered 38 
prospective coal areas, 57 out of 69 proposals
were accepted. The Review and Evaluation 
Committee has recommended the approval 
of new coal operating contracts (COCs) for 
18 areas. As of 2012, the DOE monitors and 
supervises 68 COCs and issued a total of 84 
small-scale coal mining permits (SSCMPs). 
• The NREP launched in June 2011 is the
energy sector’s roadmap in the next 20 
years to develop sustainable energy system 
and access to clean and green energy. It is 
aimed at increasing the renewable energy 
(RE) installed capacity to 9,525 MW (as
aspirational target), which is more than 
double the 2010 level as base year. 
 
In 2012, the DOE awarded 101 RE service 
contracts with total installed capacity 
of 2,565.94. Of the total, five (5) service
contracts are for conversion (with total 
installed capacity of 1,061 MW) to avail of 
the incentives under the Renewable Energy 
Act. These RE Service Contracts are broken 
down as follows:
o Geothermal with eight (8);
o	 Hydro with 53;
o Biomass with seven (7);
o Wind with six (6); and,
o Solar with 27.
Installation of PV systems at beneficiary areasFor the period 2010-2012, service contracts 
awarded already reached 258 comprising of
215 new service contracts and the remaining
were for conversion. 
• As of 2012, after 14 years under a 
deregulated downstream oil industry 
environment, there is a total of 1,908 
players engaged in various activities like 
marketing, distribution and storage Total 
investment was estimated at PhP 42.60 
billion.
The DOE has been continuously monitoring 
the activities of the sector to ensure 
that there is adequate and stable supply 
of petroleum products in the country. 
Information on the sector’s activities such 
as crude and product imports, exports and 
costs, price movements, refineryproduction,
industry demand, distribution and inventory 
levels have also been maintained to promote 
fair and healthy competition in the sector. 
An Independent Oil Price Review Committee 
(IOPRC) was formed in 2012 to study if there 
is accumulation of excessive profits and
unfair pricing. The final report of the study
was submitted to DOE in August 2012 with 
the following major findings, among others:
o Oil Deregulation Law’s goals of 
increased competition and fair price 
(lower than in an oligopoly) are being 
achieved;
o Deregulation has resulted in increased 
responsiveness of local pump prices 
(Metro Manila prices) to world oil 
prices; 
o Pump price response to changes in the 
world oil prices have been symmetrical; 
and,
o	 Oil companies’ profits are reasonable.
• To develop the downstream natural gas 
industry, Pilipinas Shell conducted a 
technical feasibility on the installation of a 
Floating Storage Regasification Unit (FSRU)
in Batangas through a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) signed with DOE in 
June 2012. The viability of the proposed 
FSRU is linked with the implementation of 
the Batangas-Manila (Batman 1) pipeline 
network. The results of the study will be 
available in the first semester of 20132
. 
On the other hand, the Philippine National 
Oil Company (PNOC) with assistance from 
JICA is conducting a feasibility study for 
Batman 1 in 2013.
Meanwhile, the PNOC–Energy Corporation 
(PNOC-EC) will replace the Mamplasan 
CNG Refueling facility and put up a new 
one in the Port Area of Batangas City under 
the Natural Gas Vehicle Program for Public 
Transport (NGVPPT) pilot project. Said 
CNG refueling stations are expected to be 
operational by 1st quarter of 2014.
• In the promotion of alternative fuels for 
the transport sector, total production of 
biodiesel in 2012 reached 137.88 million 
liters, while that of bioethanol was at 32.44 
million liters. The DOE issued a Certificate
of Registration to one (1) biodiesel plant 
(Philippine Biochem Products, Inc.) in May 
2012 with total capacity of 12 million liters 
per year. 
In terms of utilization on the mandatory 
use of 2.0 percent biodiesel blend and 10.0 
percent bioethanol blend, total actual sales 
in 2012 for biodiesel stood at 137.47 million 
liters, while for bioethanol about 38.89 
million liters (including inventory).
The DOE collaborated with the academe on 
several biofuels projects to wit: 
1. With Mariano Marcos State University 
(MMSU) in May 2012 on “Village Scale 
Production of MMSU Hydrous Ethanol as 
Feedstock for R & D in Biofuel Trials and 
Anhydrous Ethanol Production;”
2 Completed in July 2013
2. With Xavier University in July 2012 
on “Bioethanol Production Potential of 
Different Cassava Varieties under 
Northern Mindanao Condition and 
Development of a Pilot-scale Cassava 
Bioethanol Plan;” and,
3. With the University of Philippines 
Visayas Foundation, Inc. in August 2012 
on the project “Bioethanol Production 
from Macro-algae and Socio-ecological 
Implementations.”
• There are 41 CNG public utility buses 
commercially operating along South Luzon 
routes. To enhance incentives for CNG bus 
operators, the Department of Transportation 
and Communication (DOTC) signified its
preferential approval of franchise applications 
for CNG-fed buses except for routes that 
pass along Epifanio Delos Santos Avenue 
(EDSA). Likewise, the Metropolitan Manila 
Development Authority (MMDA) granted 
exemption to CNG buses under the the Unified
Vehicle Volume Reduction Scheme. 
Meanwhile, the Auto-Liquefied Petroleum
Gas (Auto-LPG) Repowering Program has 
benefitted the public transport through
lower fuel cost of about PhP15.00/liter (LPG
cost compared with conventional gasoline 
fuel). The program was able to facilitate the 
establishment of 321 accredited auto-LPG 
conversion shops. 
On the Electric Vehicle Program, there are 
20 e-trike units in Mandaluyong City as a 
pilot project to assess the techno-economic 
viability of electric-powered tricycles. Under 
the ADB Loan Assistance Program, 100,000 
e-trike units will be purchased to replace 
two-stroke tricycle units thereby reducing 
petroleum consumption and achievjng lower 
emission level. In November 2012, the loan 
negotiation between the government and 
ADB was concluded. Subsequently, said 
loan was approved by the ADB Board on 11 
December 2012. 
• A silver lining in energy management is 
the promotion of energy efficiency and
conservation (EE&C) as a way of life for 
Filipinos. Under the government’s NEECP, 
the country was able to save 4.79 MTOE 
in 2012. This is about 14.6 percent higher 
than the 2011 level of 4.10 MTOE. Several 
sub-components of the program have 
all contributed to the increase in energy 
savings, such as the use of energy labelling 
and efficiency standards, implementation
of the government energy management 
program, conduct of IEC activities and the 
calibrated phase-out of inefficient energy
technologies promoted by the Philippine 
Energy Efficiency Program (PEEP). 
As part of the PEEP, the DOE completed 
the distribution of 3.6 million compact 
fluorescent lamps (CFLs) through the
188 congressional districts and 51 party
list representatives. Further, CFLs were 
also distributed to the disadvantaged 
individuals, families and communities 
under the Department of Social Welfare 
and Development’s (DSWD) – National 
Poverty Reduction Strategy and Countryside 
Partnership.
As part of the Bright Now! Do Right! Be 
Bright! Campaign, the DOE in partnership 
with ADB launched the “Watts Out!” TV 
Olympics in August 2012 to demonstrate the 
most energy efficient technologies available
in the local television market. The Watts Out! 
activity sought to demonstrate the impact 
of the appliance’s power consumption 
to the monthly electricity bill. Television 
manufacturers participated in the activity

In September 2012, a total of 223 households 
were energized in the provinces of Antique 
(61), Aklan (29), Palawan (57) and Davao
del Norte (76) through the free installation 
of efficient technology demonstration 
package. The package includes six (6) 
pieces of LED lamps, lockable battery, 
mounting structure, charge controller 
with built-in AM/FM radio and outlets for 
mobile phone charger using photovoltaic 
solar home systems in lieu of kerosene and 
candles.
The DOE, in partnership with JICA, conducted 
the Development Study on Energy Efficiency
and Conservation for the Philippines. The 
study provided a concept design for the 
proposed legislation on energy efficiency
and conservation
ENERGY OUTLOOK 
For this PEP Update, two (2) scenarios were 
developed for the supply side – the Business-asUsual (BAU) and the Low Carbon Scenario (LCS). 
The BAU scenario simulates the future energy 
supply based on market forces interaction. On 
the other hand, LCS scenario considers the policy 
interventions and aggressive implementations of 
plans and programs for clean and environmentfriendly energy fuels and technologies. On the 
demand side, the LCS scenario serves as the 
reference case with inclusion of the sector’s 
goal of 10.0 percent energy savings on the total 
energy demand of all economic sectors by the 
end of the planning period. 
Over the planning period, the total final energy
consumption (TFEC) will exhibit an annual average 
growth rate of 2.8 percent. TFEC will reach 39.1 
MTOE by the end of the planning period. 
 
The transport sector will account for the biggest 
share at an annual average of 35.5 percent to
the total energy consumption, and will post an 
annual average growth rate of 2.9 percent. The 
industry sector follows next with an average 
share of 33.7 percent and will exhibit the fastest 
growth at 5.1 percent annual average rate.
Commercial, agriculture and residential sectors 
will post average growth rates of 2.7, 0.8 and -0.6 
percent, respectively, for the planning horizon. 
Oil will still be the major fuel accounting for 
an average share of 43.5 percent of the total
energy demand. Such share of oil is lower 
than 2011 level of almost 50.0 percent share.
This is attributed to target increase in biofuels 
blends (20.0 percent for biodiesel by 2025 and
bioethanol by 2020), the increase in the number 
of CNG buses and taxis, and the entry of electric 
vehicles starting with e-trikes. 
For the transport sector, about 42.0 percent of 
the total energy demand of the sector is diesel 
followed by gasoline with 28.4 percent average 
share. With increased biofuels blends and the 
target increase in the number of CNG buses and 
taxis to 15,000 and 16,000 units, respectively,
and e-vehicles to 230,000 units nationwide 
by the end of the planning period, significant
amount of oil consumption (diesel and gasoline) 
will be displaced. The LPG for transport is 
also seen to increase over the planning period 
registering an annual average share of almost 
1.0 percent. For the 16th Congress, an LPG 
Industry Bill will be proposed to regulate the 
utilization and safety requirement of the said 
fuel for transport.
Electricity consumption comes next with 22.9 
percent average share and growing annually 
at 3.8 percent. The growth in electricity 
consumption has also factored in the 10.0 
percent efficiency improvement with the
aggressive implementation of the NEECP. The 
passage of an EE & C Law, which will likewise 
be filed in the 16th Congress, will further
strengthen the NEECP and vital to realizing the 
target efficiency improvement.
Coal consumption will also continue to grow at 
an annual average rate of 7.8 percent. On the 
other hand, biomass consumption is projected 
to decrease over the planning period due to the 
shift to more efficient fuel.
Total primary energy supply will grow at an 
annual average rate of 3.4 percent to reach 73.9 
MTOE in 2030 under the BAU. In comparison, 
the growth rate of total energy supply in LCS will 
be higher by 2.0 percentage points. Such is due 
to the utilization of more RE resources, such as 
hydro, geothermal, wind and solar, contributing 
about 37.3 percent average share to the total 
energy supply. 
Oil and Oil Products 
 
For the planning period, oil will still be the 
primary fuel source with an average share of 
28.2 percent to the total energy supply and with 
an average growth rate of 2.1 percent in the BAU 
scenario. However, under LCS, the share of oil
is expected to decline contributing an average 
of 27 percent share at an annual moderate 
growth rate of 1.9 percent on the average. 
This is attributed to increased penetration of 
alternative fuels and renewable energy. 
The domestic upstream sector targets to harness 
potential oil and gas fields through the awarding
of 61 Service Contracts from the conduct of the 
PECR during the planning period. 
Natural Gas
Natural gas is seen to contribute an average 
share of 9.0 percent to the total primary supply 
increasing at an annual average growth rate of 
of 4.9 percent under BAU. The supply of gas 
will be basically sourced from Malampaya and 
additional gas (uncontracted gas) from other 
potential fields. 
The liquefied natural gas (LNG) importation
is seen to provide additional gas supply 
requirement for the country in the LCS especially 
if no new gas fields will be discovered during
the planning horizon. The share of natural gas 
in LCS is about 10.3 percent with a projected 
annual growth rate of 6.9 percent. Thus, it 
is critical to put in place vital infrastructures 
such as gas pipelines and LNG terminals for the 
development of the natural gas industry. 
The updating of the Master Plan Study for 
the Development of the Natural Gas Industry 
in the country has been completed in March 
2012 through the technical assistance of 
JICA. Meanwhile, a complementary study was 
conducted by World Bank on the feasibility of 
supplying natural gas in Mindanao, which was 
completed in June 2012. The WB study reviewed 
the current and existing LNG transportation, 
receiving, storage and regasification approaches,
including analysis of a suitable LNG terminal 
site in the region. Further, the WB study also 
revisited the identified LNG sites in the Bataan
peninsula. Another WB complementary study 
titled “Mindanao Natural Gas Development 
Strategy” was also conducted with the primary 
goal of determining the region’s possible access 
to the international gas market. 
A Downstream Natural Gas Industry Law will 
also be filed in the 16th Congress to provide
the regulatory framework and incentives 
to prospective investors. Infrastructure 
development is strategic to ensure the supply of 
gas that will fuel prospective capacity additions 
from natural gas power plants, industry uses, 
and the CNG buses and taxis. 
Coal 
Coal will contribute an average share of 30.1 
percent to the country’s primary energy supply 
under the BAU and will increase at a rate 
of 7.2 percent annually during the planning 
period. The government targets to increase 
indigenous coal production by 100.0 percent. 
Increasing the contribution of indigenous coal 
would reduce coal importation. Imported coal 
contributes around 70.0 percent average share 
to the country’s supply requirements.A much lower average growth rate of 4.8 percent 
is seen in the LCS with equivalent contribution 
of 25.2 percent average share to the primary
energy supply. This is due to the utilization 
of more RE resources in the power generation, 
which will displace some capacities from coal. 
Renewable Energy 
Under the BAU, contribution from RE will grow 
at an annual average rate of 0.8 percent (and 
with average share of 32.6 percent) with only 
the committed RE power projects coming into 
the system. 
The passage of Renewable Energy Act of 2008 
strengthens the policy of the government to 
accelerate the exploration and development of 
RE resources in the country. With this, around 
9,300 MW from indicative and potential RE 
resources (geothermal, hydro, wind, solar, 
biomass, and ocean) have been identified as
aspirational target which could be harnessed 
within the planning period. 
For LCS, RE will grow at an annual average of 
3.2 percent and will contribute an average 
share of 37.0 percent to the total energy supply. 
Geothermal will grow at an average rate of 4.2 
percent contributing an average share of 64.0 
percent of total RE. Meanwhile, hydro will exhibit 
3.5 percent average growth rate and with an
average share of 15.0 percent (total RE) within
the planning period. Biomass will demonstrate 
11.2 percent average share of RE. However,
biomass supply will be on a downward trend by 
the end of the planning period. Combined share 
of solar and wind will be almost 1.0 percent and 
will exhibit an annual average growth rate of 
20.4 percent.
Alternative Fuels (Biofuels) 
Under both scenarios, the mandated 2.0 percent 
biodiesel blend (which started in 2009) will have 
to increase to 20.0 percent by 2025, and the 10.0
percent bioethanol blend (started in 2011) will 
be accelerated to 20.0 percent by 2020. With the 
required mandated blends, biodiesel will grow at 
an annual average growth rate of 15.5 percent,
while bioethanol will increase by 9.5 percent.
Power Sector
The country’s peak demand for power will grow 
at an annual average rate of 4.3 percent over 
the planning period. The country will need 
about 13,166.7 MW of new capacities to meet 
domestic power requirement – energy demand 
and reserve margin. From the needed capacity, 
1,766.7 MW will be provided by committed 
power projects, while the remaining 11,400 MW 
will be available for private sector investment. 
Of the 11,400 MW, 8,400 MW will be baseload 
plants, 2,100 MW mid-range plants, and 900 
MW peaking plants. 
The investment requirement to pursue and 
undertake the sectoral targets for this plan 
update is estimated at Php 2.80 trillion. As such, 
the government must intensify its initiatives 
to promote and showcase the various energy 
investment opportunities with the private 
sector. 
Considering the vulnerability of the energy 
sector to conditions like extreme weather 
patterns, an energy sector-wide climate change 
adaptation strategy is envisioned to be put 
in place. Said framework aims to address the 
climate change impacts in energy systems, such 
as power transmission and distribution systems, 
fuel distribution and renewable energy systems. 
II. ENERGY DEMAND AND SUPPLY OUTLOOK
2011 Energy Situationer
ENERGY-ECONOMY INDICATORS3
The Philippines’ economic output in terms of 
real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), posted 
feeble growth of 3.7 percent in 2011 compared 
to a robust 7.6 percent in 2010, as government 
under-spending on infrastructure slowed down 
the domestic economy in the second and third 
quarters of the year.
The Services sector grew resiliently by 5.0
percent, contributing more than half of real 
GDP (56.5 percent share in 2011), as combined
revenues from domestic trade, finance and real
estate sectors helped sustain the economy. 
Meanwhile, the lackluster performance of the 
construction sector, beleaguered by government 
underspending, pulled down the Industry 
sector’s growth to a measly 1.9 percent despite 
favorable manufacturing output. Meanwhile, 
the Agriculture, Fishery and Forestry (AFF) 
sector rebounded to a 2.6 percent growth in 
2011, from the previous year’s contraction, 
as crop production recovered from El 
Niño phenomenon that plagued the 
country in 2010. On the demand side, 
growth in consumer spending doubled 
to 6.1 percent, but was not enough to 
compensate for weakened investments 
and decline in international trade. 
ENERGY INTENSITY
The lackluster performance of the 
domestic economy in 2011 was mirrored 
in the country’s energy levels, as 
intensities registered negative growths for 
the current year. Oil intensity suffered the 
biggest decline of 9.3 percent to 1.7 barrels 
per one hundred thousand pesos of real GDP4
3 GDP figures are as of January 2011 National Accounts of

4 2000 prices
(BBL/Php100,00 of GDP), from the previous 
years’ 1.8 BBL/Php100,00 of GDP as importation 
was discouraged by political turmoil in the 
Middle East drove international prices higher. 
The decline in oil supply likewise contributed 
to the drop in energy intensity of 2.5 percent to
6.7 tonnes of oil equivalent per million pesos of 
real GDP (TOE/MPhp) from last year’s 6.9 TOE/
MPhp, albeit indicating an improvement from 
the previous years’ -5.7 percent that can be
attributed to the recovery of renewable energy, 
particularly hydropower, in 2011. Relatedly, 
electricity intensity fell by 1.7 percent, from 
11.9 watt-hour per peso of real GDP (Wh/Php) 
in 2010 to 11.7 Wh/Php in 2011, as oil supply 
woes trickled down to eletricity generation. 
Meanwhile, the combined improvements in 
energy efficiency and structural changes in the
economy caused sectoral energy intensities 
to decline further in 2011. Energy use per 
unit of industrial output dropped to 0.35
TOE/Php100,000 2.3 percent lower than last 
year’s 0.36 TOE/Php100,000 as production 
processes became more energy efficient
and with production levels of non-energy 
intensive industries increased more rapidly

Figure 1. ENERGY INTENSITIES, 2000 – 2011Oil remained as the country’s major energy 
source, accounting for 31.4 percent of the primary 
energy supply mix, followed by geothermal with 
21.7 and coal with 19.6 percent share. 
Total primary oil supply dropped by 9.0 percent 
to 12.4 MTOE in 2011, from 13.6 MTOE in 2010, 
while total primary coal supply increased by 
10.0 percent to reach 7.7 MTOE from 7.0 MTOE in 
2010. Major renewable energy sources likewise 
registered increases in production levels during 
the year, led by wind energy with 42.9 percent, 
followed by hydro and geothermal with 21.0 
percent and 0.1 percent, respectively, while 
biomass and solar energy production declined 
by 0.8 percent and 3.4 percent, respectively. 
Meanwhile, natural gas production from the 
Malampaya well went up by 8.0 percent in 2011.
INDIGENOUS ENERGY
Total indigenous energy production grew 
from 23.0 MTOE in 2010 to 23.6 MTOE in 
2011. The growth in domestic supply is 
attributed to the higher production output, 
and consequently increased contribution, 
of coal, natural gas, geothermal, hydro and 
biodiesel. On the other hand, output from 
local sources for solar power, biomass and 
bioethanol decreased by 3.4 percent, 0.8 
percent and 71.0 percent, respectively. 
Fossil Fuels
A. Oil
The country’s aggregate oil production 
(including condensate) dropped by 8.7 
percent, from its year ago level of 0.92 MTOE 
(7,954. 3 MB) to 0.84 MTOE (7,397.6 MB)
in 2011, as domestic crude oil production 
plummeted by 24.0 percent due to the 
suspension of the production of Galoc field
since November 2011 to give way for repairs 
and upgrade being undertaken in the 
Floating Production Storage and Offloading
Rubicon Intrepid vessel, as well as the 
looming depletion of most oil fields. On the
other hand, a 3.6 percent increase in condensate, 
which is derived from the production of natural 
gas, was posted from 0.51 MTOE (4,894.8 MB) in
2010 to 0.53 MTOE (5,072.0 MB) in 2011.
B. Coal
The country’s total indigenous coal supply 
accounted for 15.4 percent ofthe total indigenous
production (equivalent to 9.2 percent of the 
TPES). Local coal production reached 3.6 KTOE 
(6.9 MMT6
), 3.5 percent higher as compared
to the previous year’s level of 3.5 KTOE (6.7
MMT). This can be attributed to the gain in the 
production of Semirara Mining Corporation, 
which continues to be the major coal producer in 
the country. Semirara contributed a bulk share 
of 94.0 percent of the total local coal production, 
6 Million metric tonsRunofMine (ROM) at 10000 BTU/lb
than energy-intensive sectors. The Services 
sector likewise experienced a reduction in 
energy intensity of 4.7 percent from 0.37 TOE/
Php100,000 in 2010 to 0.35 TOE/Php100,000
in 2011, which can be attributed to intensified
energy conservation in most establishments. On 
the other hand, the AFF sector registered the 
biggest decline in energy use per unit of output 
at 15.2 percent, from 0.05 TOE/Php100,000
last year to 0.04 TOE/Php100,000 in 2011, as 
the production from fishery sub-sectors, which
generally used more energy, were relatively 
lower than the previous year. 
ENERGY ELASTICITY
The sluggish growth of both energy and 
economic output in 2011 put energy-toGDP elasticity at 0.31, albeit slightly higher 
than its year-ago level of 0.19. Similarly, 
oil’s elasticity for 2011 was higher at 1.58
vis-à-vis the previous year’s 0.62, while 
electricity elasticty dropped to 0.52, from
last year’s 1.23, These data further affirm
that changes in economic output have 
relatively negligible effect on the demand 
for energy and electricity (whose elasticity 
level is generally less than 1.0), while oil 
demand responds quicker to changes in GDP 
(whose elasticity is usually greater than 1.0). 
ENERGY PER CAPITA
In 2011, the amount of energy consumed per 
person was reduced to 0.42 TOE/person, 1.0 
percent lower than the previous year’s level, 
as population grew faster than that of total 
energy use. 
Similarly, oil per capita fell by 7.9 percent to 
1.05 barrels per preson (BBL/person) from last
year’s 1.14 BBL/person, indicating a reduction 
in oil consumption per person. Meanwhile, 
electricty per capita remain unchanged from 
the previous year’s level of 0.73 megawatt hour per person (MWh/person), 
attributed to intensified campaigns for rural
electrification for 2011.
2011 PRIMARY ENERGY SUPPLY
The country’s total primary energy supply 
(TPES) in 2011 grew slowly at a rate of 0.3 
percent reaching 39.4 MTOE compared to 
the 2010 level of 39.3 MTOE5
 (Figure 4). 
The sluggish movement in total supply was 
due to the 3.4 percent drop in net imports, 
from 16.3 MTOE in 2010 to 15.8 MTOE in
2011, while domestic production went up 
by 2.9 percent.
5 TPES for 2010 is reflective of the changed of methodology 
used in accounting International Civil Aviation which was 
applied starting 2011

ENERGY	  ELASTICITY
The	   sluggish	   growth	   of	   both	   energy	   and	   economic	  
output	  in	  2011	  put	  energy-­‐to-­‐GDP	  elasticity	  at	  0.31,	  
albeit	  slightly	  higher	  than	  its	  year-­‐ago	  level	  of	  0.19.	  
Similarly,	  oil’s	  elasticity	  for	  2011	  was	  higher	  at	  1.58	  
vis-­‐à-­‐vis	   the	   previous	   year’s	   0.62,	   while	   electricity	  
elasticty	   dropped	   to	   0.52,	   from	   last	   year’s	   1.23,	  
These	  data	  further	  affirm	  that	  changes	  in	  economic	  
output	   have	   relatively	   negligible	   effect	   on	   the	  
demand	   for	  energy	  and	  electricity	   (whose	  elasticity	  
level	   is	   generally	   less	   than	   1.0)	   ,	   while	   oil	   demand	  
responds	   quicker	   to	   changes	   in	   GDP	   (whose	  
elasticity	  is	  usually	  greater	  than	  1.0).	  	  
ENERGY	  PER	  CAPITA
In	   2011,	   the	   amount	   of	   energy	   consumed	   per	  
person	   was	   reduced	   to	   0.42	   TOE/person,	   1.0

1.05	   barrels	   per	   preson	   (BBL/person)	   from	   last

B. Coal
The	   country’s	   total	   indigenous	   coal	   supply	  
accounted	   for	   15.4	   percent	   of	   the	   total	  indigenous	  
production	   (equivalent	   to	  9.2 percent	  of	   the	  TPES).

2011
Figure 4. TOTAL PRIMARY ENERGY SUPPLY MIX (in Percent), 
 2011 and 2010level of 106.7 KTOE, triggered by the significant
reduction in local ethanol production of 71.0 
percent, from 5.53 KTOE in 2010 to 1.6 KTOE in
2011. A significant number of biofuels producers
in the country resorted to cease production 
operations due to their inability to cope with 
the market price competition. Unresolved 
issues on tariff of imported ethanol are another 
culprit to the declining biofuel production that 
led producers to divert their products to the 
sugar industry which posed a higher market 
value for their yield. For the year 2011, only San 
Carlos Bioenergy Incorporated and Leyte Agri 
Corporation continued to operate with a total 
aggregate capacity of 49 million liters. Thus, the 
unstable domestic production necessitated 
122.3 KTOE of imported ethanol to sustain 
the required supply, translating to an 
increase of 53.5 percent in 2011 over its
year-ago level of 78.5 KTOE.
On the other hand, local production of 
Coco Methyl Ester (CME) continued to 
grow at a steady rate of 0.9 percent from 
2010 to 2011. As of 2011, there were nine 
(9) out of 12 CME production facilities 
in operation which are duly accredited 
by the Department of Energy. During the 
year the aggregate production capacity 
for CME amounts to 364.6 million liters. 
E. Solar
Solar energy production decreased to 0.1 KTOE 
which is 3.4 percent lower compared to 2010 
level of 0.11 KTOE. While solar energy has the 
smallest contribution to the energy mix, it is 
expected that its contribution will increase with 
the growing number of awarded solar projects 
during the year. The expected increase may be 
further strengthened by the implementation of 
the policy mechanisms under RE Law.
F. Wind
In 2011, production of wind energy showed 
a notable increase of 42.9 percent from its 
2010 level of 5.3 KTOE. During the year, wind
energy has a minimal contribution of 0
02 
percent to the primary energy supply in 2011. 
This is expected to increase with the additional 
747 MW aggregate capacity of wind contracts 
awarded during the year.
NET IMPORTS7
Net energy imports in 2011 accounted for 40.0 
percent of the total energy supply, reaching 15.8
MTOE, albeit 3.4 percent lower than the 2010 
level of 16.3 MTOE. 
Net imported energy in 2011 is comprised of 
73.3 percent oil and oil products; 26.0 percent 
coal; and, 0.8 percent biofuels. 
Net oil importation declined by 9.0 percent, 
from 12.7 MTOE or 96,078.4 thousand barrels 
(MB) in 2010 to 11.5 MTOE (87,885.4 MB)
in 2011. Total oil imports decreased by 7.1 
percent from 15.8 MTOE in 2010 to 14.7 MTOE
in 2011. Bulk of the total imports was credited 
to crude oil, posting 59.2 percent share, while
the remaining 40.8 percent is from the finished
oil products. Middle East crudes remained as the 
country’s major source of crude oil, supplying 
76.4 percent or 51,039 MB of the total crude
mix, while crude from Russia (14,318 MB) 
distributed 21.4 percent of the total crude mix 
and the remaining 2.2 percent was sourced from 
Malaysia (1,485 MB). The 2011 import volume
7 The sum of imports and stock change (+/-) less exports 
and international bunkers (aviation and marine)
which is equivalent to 3.4 MTOE (6.5 MMT).
In addition, private producers in Zamboanga 
del Sur increased their total production to 
88.2 KTOE (0.17 MMT) in 2011, almost double 
its 2010 level of 42.7 KTOE (0.08 MMT). 
Likewise, Cebu reported 44.0 KTOE (0.08 MMT) 
production in 2011, from 35.5 KTOE (0.07 MMT)
in 2010. In contrast, small scale mines exhibited 
a considerable cut in production of 21.0 percent, 
from 78.4 KTOE (0.15 MMT) in 2010 to 61.9
KTOE (0.12 MMT) in 2011. 
C. Natural Gas
Aggregate domestic natural gas production 
during the year is 3.3 MTOE or 140,367.6 
million standard cubic feet (MMSCF), reflecting
an increase by 8.0 percent compared to the 
previous year’s actual production of 3.0 MTOE 
(130,008.5 MMSCF). The increase in volume
of production was due to high off-take of the 
country’s three gas power plants, despite the 
implementation of the seven day shutdown in 
the Malampaya facilities and the Ilijan power 
plant during the second half of 2011. 
Gas consumption for power generation reached 
3.1 MTOE (133,226.5 MMSCF), a 9.3 percent
increase compared to year 2010 level. In 2011, 
natural gas contributed around 41 percent in 
the Luzon generation mix. 
Renewable Energy
A. Geothermal
Geothermal production went up by 0.1 percent 
from its 2010 level of 8.5 MTOE to 8.6 MTOE in
2011 and is still expected to increase for the next 
years that will be brought by the six Geothermal 
Service Contracts awarded within the year in 
addition to those awarded in 2010.
Since most of the country’s high enthalpy 
geothermal resources have already been 
developed into commercial operations, 
thereby making the Philippines second in 
geothermal installed capacity in the world, 
geothermal resources contributed 362 percent 
to the total indigenous energy supply in 2011 
(corresponding to 21.7 percent share to TPES). 
B. Hydro
The country’s hydropower resources 
contributed a 9.9 percent share to the total 
indigenous energy supply in 2011 (equivalent 
to 6.0 percent share to TPES). Hydropower
production took a significant increase of 21.7
percent, from 1.9 MTOE in 2010 to 2.4 MTOE due 
to the additional 91.0 MW capacity during the 
year. The increase in hydro energy production 
is also attributed to favorable weather condition 
during the year, a respite from the El Niño that 
plagued the country last year, immensely helped 
hydropower plants maintain their required 
water level in reservoir. 
C. Biomass 
Biomass remains a major part of the indigenous 
energy supply mix despite a 0.8 percent decrease 
in its 2011 level of 4.9 MTOE, which corresponds 
to a share of 30.7 percent and 20.7 percent of the 
country’s total RE and total indigenous energy 
supply, respectively. More than 99.0 percent of 
biomass supply is being used for final energy
consumption, while the remaining 1.0 percent 
being utilized for power generation exhibited 
an increase of more than 100 percent due to the 
installation of additional 45 MW biomass plant
in 2011, bringing biomass installed capacity to a 
total of 83 MW. 
Furthermore, a total of 16 biomass projects 
were awarded during the year with more or less 
150 MW aggregate biomass capacities which
is expected to be contributed for the year and 
the next years. With the implementation of the 
RE Law, biomass is expected to continuously 
increase its share in the energy supply mix with 
the emergent number of existing and operational 
biomass power facilities.
D. Biofuels
In 2011, biofuels production posted a negative 
growth of 29 percentfrom its previous year’s 
their	   inability	   to	   cope	   with	   the	   market	   price	  
competition.	   	   Unresolved	   issues	   on	   tariff	   of	  
imported	   ethanol	   are	   another	   culprit	   to	   the	  
declining	   biofuel	   production	   that	   led	   producers	   to	  
divert	   their	   products	   to	   the	   sugar	   industry	   which	  
posed	  a	  higher	  market	  value	  for	  their	  yield.	  	  For	  the	  
year	   2011,	   only	   San	   Carlos	   Bioenergy	   Incorporated	  
and	   Leyte	   Agri	   Corporation	   continued	   to	   operate	  
with	   a	   total	   aggregate	   capacity	   of	   49	  million	   liters.	  
Thus,	   the	   unstable	   domestic	   production	  
necessitated	   122.3	   kTOE	   of	   imported	   ethanol	   to	  
sustain	   the	   required	   supply,	   translating	   to	   an	  
increase	   of	   53.5	   percent	   in	   2011	   over	   its	   year-­‐ago	  
level	  of	  78.5	  kTOE.	  
On	  the	  other	  hand,	  local	  production	  of	  Coco	  Methyl	  
Ester	   (CME)	   continued	   to	   grow	   at	   a	   steady	   rate	   of	  
0.9	   percent	   from	   2010	   to	   2011.	   As	   of	   2011,	   there	  
were	  nine	  (9)	  out	  of	  12	  CME	  production	  facilities	  in	  
operation	   which	   are	   duly	   accredited	   by	   the	  
Department	   of	   Energy.	   During	   the	   year	   the	  
aggregate	  production	  capacity	   for	  CME	  amounts	   to	  
364.6	  million	  liters.	  
E. Solar
Solar	   energy	   production	   decreased	   to	   0.1	   kTOE	  
which	  is	  3.4	  percent	  lower	  compared	   to	  2010	  level	  
of	   0.11	   kTOE.	   While	   solar	   energy	   has	   the	   smallest	  
contribution	   to	   the	   energy	   mix,	   it	   is	   expected	   that
its	   contribution	   will	   increase	   with	   the	   growing	  
number	   of	  awarded	   solar	   projects	   during	   the	   year.	  	  
The	  expected	  increase	  may	  be	  further	  strengthened	  
by	   the	   implementation	   of	   the	   policy	   mechanisms	  
under	  RE	  Law.
F. Wind
In	   2011,	   production	   of	   wind	   energy	   showed	   a	  
notable	  increase	  of	  42.9	  percent	  from	  its	  2010	  level	  
of	   5.3	   kTOE.	   	   During	   the	   year,	   wind	   energy	   has	   a	  
minimal	  contribution	  of	  0.02	  percent	  to	  the	  primary

percent	  coal;	  and,	  0.8	  percent	  biofuels.	  
Net	   oil	   importation	   declined	   by	   9.0	   percent,	   from	  
12.7	   MTOE	   or	   96,078.4	   thousand	   barrels	   (MB)	   in	  
2010	  to	  11.5	  MTOE	  (87,885.4	  MB)	  in	  2011.	  	  Total	  oil

in	   2010	   to	   14.7	   MTOE	   in	   2011.	   Bulk	   of	   the	   total	  
imports	   was	   credited	   to	   crude	   oil,	   posting	   59.2	  
percent	   share,	   while	   the	   remaining	   40.8	   percent	   is	  
from	   the	   finished	   oil	   products.	   Middle	   East	   crudes	  
remained	  as	  the	  country’s	  major	  source	  of	  crude	  oil,	  
supplying	   76.4	   percent	   or	   51,039	   MB	   of	   the	   total

percent with 8.6 MTOE. This is followed by coal 
with 28.0 percent (5.8 MTOE) while natural gas
(3.1 MTOE) and hydro (2.4 MTOE) comprised 
15.0 percent and 11.4 percent, respectively. The
rest comprised wind, solar and biomass. 
TOTAL FINAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION
Given the feeble economic state of 2011, TFEC 
reached 23.0 MTOE, a 0.6 percent drop from 
the previous year’s level of 23.1 MTOE. This is 
attributed to the decline in energy use for the 
two biggest energy-consuming sector – transport 
and residential.
Energy consumption in the transport 
sector went down by 0.7 percent 
reaching 8.0 MTOE, as uncertainties in 
the international market pulled down 
oil consumption. Similarly, energy 
demand in the residential sector was 
cut by 2.0 percent to 6.0 MTOE in 2011, 
from last year’s 6.1 MTOE, as all fuels 
utilized by households registered lower 
consumption levels for 2011. Meanwhile, 
despite its 1.3 percent share to TFEC, 
energy use in the AFF sector plummeted 
by 13.0 percent to 302.3 KTOE, from 
its year-ago level of 347.4 KTOE. On 
the other hand, energy consumed for 
industrial purposes reached 5.9 MTOE
which is slightly higher than its previous 
year level. Major services and commercial 
establishments, on the other hand, 
registered a 2.9 percent increase in energy 
demand to 2.7 MTOE.
Transport maintained its top position in 
terms of having the largest share to total 
final energy demand at 34.7 percent,
followed by the residential sector at 26.1 
percent share, and industry with 25.9
percent share.
In terms of fuel type, petroleum products 
continued to dominate the country’s total 
final energy consumption, accounting
for a bulk share of 48.6 percent, while 
biomass and electricity registered almost the 
same contribution of 21.1 and 21.0 percent, 
respectively. 
Total consumption of oil and oil products 
dropped by 1.4 percent reaching 11.2 MTOE, 
pulled down by the reduction in gasoline and 
fuel oil usage of 1.4 percent and 21.3 percent, 
respectively, considering that the combined 
demand levels for these fuels account for 34.8 
percent of the total oil consumption. Utilization 
of kerosene likewise contracted by 10.2 percent 
reaching 132.3 KTOE from last year’s 147.24 
of finished petroleum products dropped by 15.6
percent from 54,607 MB of 2010 to 46,065 MB,
which was partly due to high crude import 
volume and increased refinery production
output during the period. Exports increased 
by 7.6 percent, with other petroleum products 
taking the largest share. Oil products that were 
exported to various countries such as Korea, 
Singapore and Taiwan include fuel oil, naphtha 
and other petroleum products.
The country’s coal importation exhibited a 
minimal decline of 0.03 percent from 2010 
level of 5.8 MTOE (10,962.5 MMT). Indonesia
was the country’s most significant trading
partner accounting for more than 98.0 percent 
of the total coal importation in 2011. Australia 
supplied around 1.2 percent of the country’s 
coal requirement, with the remaining 1.0 
percent sourced from Vietnam. On the other 
hand, coal exports fell by more than 33.0 
percent, to 1.4 MTOE (2,736.3 MMT). China 
is considerably the biggest consumer of 
Philippine coal despite its demand weakening 
by 13.9 percent to 1.4 MTOE (2,681.6 MMT) 
from 1.6 MTOE (3,115.5 MMT) in 2010. On
the other hand around 2.0 percent of the total 
coal exports were shipped to Thailand.
Ethanol imports in 2011 increased by 10.9 
percent, from 107.9 KTOE in 2010 to 119.3 KTOE. 
The increase may be attributed to non-operation of 
bioethanol producers in the country due to higher 
production cost and consequently, the market’s 
preference for lower-priced imported bioethanol. 
TRANSFORMATION SECTOR
Oil Refining
The total marketable products accounted 96.8 
percent (8.8 MTOE) of the refinery crude run 
(9.1 MTOE) in 2011, resulting to increased 
refinery utilization from 65.0 percent in 2010
to 69.1 percent in 2011. About 2.8 percent 
(0.26 MTOE) comprised refinery fuel and 
losses8
. Diesel accounted for the bulk of the 
refinery product output with 37.4 percent share,
followed by fuel oil and gasoline, with shares 
of 19.6 percent and 19.0 percent, respectively. 
Aviation turbo or Jet A-1 contributed 9.0 percent 
share, while LPG and kerosene each put in 6.7 
percent and 1.2 percent shares to total refinery
output. Naphtha had the least share with 2.0 
percent, while the remaining portion comprised 
other non-energy products.
Power Generation
Total energy requirement from the production 
of electricity in 2011 accounted for 20.6 MTOE 
which translated to electricity output of 28.8 
percent or 5.9 MTOE (69.1 TWh). This is slightly
lower by 0.4 percentage points from the 29.2 
percent electricity output in 2010 with 5.8 MTOE
(67.7 TWh) vis-a-vis 20.0 MTOE of energy input. 
For 2011, electricity generated from fossil fuels 
constituted 71.6 percent, equal to 4.3 MTOE, 
while renewable energy sources chipped in 28.4 
percent or 1.7 MTOE (Figure 7). In terms of fuel

Energy consumption	   in	   the	   transport	   sector	   went	  
down	   by	   0.7	   percent	   reaching	   8.0	   MTOE,	   as

Figure 8. FINAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION BY SECTOR (in MTOE), 
2010-2011 Despite sustaining its position as the country’s 
most energy-intensive sector in 2011, the 
transport sector’s aggregate energy consumption 
slightly declined by 0.7 percent compared to 
its year-ago level of 8.0 MTOE. Road transport 
demand, accounted for more than 87.0 percent 
of the total transport, dropped down to 7.0 MTOE 
which is 1.3 percent lower than its previous 
level. Energy consumed for water transport also 
went down by 4.7 percent reaching merely 0.7 
MTOE. In contrast, domestic aviation posted a 
double-digit growth of 29.9 percent, bringing 
demand level to 0.3 MTOE. This is mainly due 
to the booming domestic air travel industry 
of the country which grew by 11.6 percent 
in 2011 as reported by the Civil Aeronautics 
Board. Similarly, the public’s steady patronage 
of the country’s light rail systems boosted rail 
transport consumption by 2.0 percent in the 
same year, despite a measly contribution of 0.1 
percent to the sector’s over-all energy demand. 
Oil (petroleum) remained as the sector’s 
primary fuel accounting for a hefty share of 
97.3 percent amidst the 0.9 percent reduction in 
consumption. Among petroleum products, diesel 
has the largest contribution of 53.8 percent
followed by gasoline with 36.0 percent, despite 
both fuels exhibiting a decline in consumption 
of 0.8 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively.
Biofuels continue to figure prominently in the
transport sector’s energy demand, as ethanol 
and biodiesel recorded increases in consumption 
of 10.1 percent and 9.9 percent, respectively. 
This may be attributed to the continued 
implementation, especially with the higher 
target blend of 10.0 percent for biodiesel 
and percent for ethanol as mandated by the 
Biofuels Law. 
On the other hand, LPG consumption in 
the sector significantly decreased by 38.0
percent,asalmost5,000unitsofLPG-fedtaxis
was phased-out. Most of these taxi units are 
year 1996 models with 2011 last operation 
year which were already included in the 
two (2) - year extension for LPG conversion. 
Thus, these 1996 model taxi units were 
eventually dropped from the auto-LPG fleet.
However, despite these developments, the
DOE continues to campaign for auto-LPG 
and to date, 31 auto-LPG conversion shops 
with PNS license are being monitored by the 
DOE to ensure safe operation and standards 
compliant conversion of gasoline fed motor 
vehicles to auto-LPG.
The DOE has continued with its campaign to 
promote the use of alternative fuels especially 
in public transport services. To date, there 
are 61 registered CNG public utility buses 
(PUB) in the country, of which 41 units are 
commercially running. Likewise, the DOE 
also renewed the Certificate of Accreditation
(CA) of four (4) CNG transport players and 
KTOE, while use of aviation gasoline plunged by 
30.4 percent to 2.5 KTOE in 2011. Meanwhile,
three petroleum products registered increases 
in demand for 2011 led by jet fuel with a doubledigit growth of 30.8 percent, LPG with a 0.6 
percent growth, and diesel, which consistently 
remain as the most widely-consumed oil 
product with 50.8 percent share of the total oil
consumption, grew by 1.6 percent. 
On the other hand, the use of biomass as fuel 
declined by 1.4 percent from 4.9 MTOE in 
2010 to 4.8 MTOE in 2011 as changes in the 
household’s fuel preference reflect a decrease
in biomass demand of 2.6 percent. However,
biomass use for industrial and commercial 
purposes went up by 1.8 percent and 1.7 
percent, respectively. 
Electricity consumption reached 4.8 
MTOE in 2011, a 1.5 percent increase
from last year’s level, due to the growth 
in consumption of various industrial 
processes indicated by the 4.1 percent 
uptick in the sector’s electricity demand. 
Meanwhile, electricity owned more than 
half (52.2 percent) of the commercial
sector’s total energy demand.
Coal consumption posted a paltry 0.4 
percent increase, from its 2010 level of 
1.8 MTOE. This is attributed to minimal 
movement in coal demand of the cement 
manufacturing sector, as construction 
activities (in which cement is a primary 
building material) slowed down due 
to government under spending on 
infrastructures.
Biofuels (CME and ethanol) consumption 
reflected a modest growth 6.6 percent
reaching 221.6 KTOE in 2011 from 
207.8 KTOE in 2010, as oil companies 
consistently comply on the mandated 
biofuel blends.
Demand for natural gas reached 77.7 
KTOE in 2011, an 11.5 percent upturn
from last year’s 69.7 KTOE due to the increased 
usage in the transport and industry sector. 
Industrial demand for natural gas is mainly from 
Pilipinas Shell , which utilizes gas for refinery
as processing fuel for gas turbine engines and 
supplemental fuel for furnaces. Natural gas 
consumption for transport reached 1.1 KTOE, 
as utilized by 41 CNG. Another 20 units of CNG 
buses is expected to come on stream as soon as 
franchises were released.

Despite	  sustaining	  its	  position	  as	  the	  country’s	  most	  
energy-­‐intensive	   sector	   in	   2011,	   the	   transport	  
sector’s	   aggregate	   energy	   consumption	   slightly	  
declined	   by	   0.7	   percent	   compared	   to	   its	   year-­‐ago	  
level	   of	   8.0	   MTOE.	   Road	   transport	   demand,	  
accounted	   for	  more	   than	   87.0 percent	   of	   the	   total	  
transport,	  dropped	  down	   to	  7.0	  MTOE	  which	  is	  1.3	  
percent	   lower	   than	   its	   previous	   level.	   Energy

4.7	  percent	  reaching	  merely	  0.7	  MTOE.	  In	  contrast,	  
domestic	   aviation	   posted	   a	   double-­‐digit	   growth	   of	  
29.9	   percent,	   bringing	   demand	   level	   to	   0.3	   MTOE.	  
This	   is	   mainly	   due	   to	   the	   booming	   domestic	   air	  
travel	   industry	   of	   the	   country	   which	   grew	   by	   11.6	  
percent	  in	  2011	  as	  reported	  by	  the	  Civil	  Aeronautics	  
Board.	   Similarly,	   the	   public’s	   steady	   patronage	   of	  
the	   country’s	   light	   rail	   systems	   boosted	   rail	  
transport	   consumption	   by	   2.0	   percent	   in	   the	   same	  
year,	   despite	   a	   measly	   contribution	   of	   0.1	   percent	  
to	  the	  sector’s over-­‐all	  energy	  demand.	  
Oil	   (petroleum)	   remained	   as	   the	   sector’s	   primary	  
fuel	   accounting	   for	   a	   hefty	   share	   of	   97.3	   percent	  
amidst	   the	   0.9	   percent	   reduction	   in	   consumption.	  
Among	   petroleum	   products,	   diesel	   has	   the	   largest	  
contribution	   of	   53.8	   percent	   followed	   by	   gasoline	  
with	   36.0	   percent,	   despite	   both	   fuels	   exhibiting	   a	  
decline	   in	   consumption	   of	   0.8	   percent	   and	   1.3	  
percent,	  respectively.
Biofuels	   continue	   to	   figure	   prominently	   in	   the	  
transport	   sector’s	   energy	   demand,	   as	   ethanol	   and	  
biodiesel	  recorded	  increases	  in	  consumption	  of	  10.1	  
percent	   and	   9.9	   percent,	   respectively.	  This	  may	   be	  
attributed	   to	   the	   continued	   implementation,	  
especially	   with	   the	   higher	   target	   blend	   of	   10.0
percent	   for	   biodiesel	   and	   percent	   for	   ethanol	   as	  
mandated	  by	  the	  Biofuels	  Law.	  
On	   the	   other	   hand,	   LPG	   consumption	  in	   the	   sector	  
significantly	   decreased	   by	   38.0	   percent,	   as	   almost	  
5,000	  units	  of	  LPG-­‐fed	   taxis	  was	  phased-­‐out.	  	  Most	  
of	  these	  taxi	  units	  are	  year	  1996	  models	  with	  2011

the two	   (2)	   -­‐ year	   extension	   for	   LPG	   conversion.	  	  
Thus,	   these	   1996	  model	   taxi	   units	   were	   eventually	  
dropped	  from	  the	  auto-­‐LPG	  fleet.	  	  However,	  despite	  
these	   developments,	   the	   DOE	   continues	   to	  
campaign	   for	   auto-­‐LPG	   and	   to	   date,	   31	   auto-­‐LPG

The	   DOE	   has	   continued	   with	   its	   campaign	   to	  
promote	   the	   use	   of	   alternative	   fuels	   especially	   in

Figure 12. ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF THE TRANSPORT 
SECTOR BY FUEL TYPE (in Percent), 2011demand with 93.6 percent with energy 
intensive industries9
 garnering 79.2 percent 
share. However, total energy used for various
manufacturing processes dropped by 0.8 
percent due to sluggish production caused by 
weaker demand for locally-made products in 
both domestic and international markets. 
The mining sub-sector posted a remarkable 
growth of 29.2 percent to reach 226.1 
KTOE in 2011 from last year’s 175.0 KTOE,
notwithstanding its meager share of 3.8 
percent in the total industry demand. 
The consecutive stream of double-digit 
growths10 may be attributed to the constant 
inflow of investments in the mining
sector which was liberalized by virtue of 
Republic Act (R.A.) 7942 otherwise known 
as the Philippine Mining Act of 1995.
Meanwhile, the energy consumed in the 
construction sub-sector reached 152.0
KTOE, translating to a marginal share of 
2.6 percent out of total industry demand. 
Coal, as fuel input for cement and basic 
metals production, contributed 30.9 
percent with demand levels reaching 
1.8 MTOE in 2011, a slight increase of 0.4 
percent from its previous level. Electricity 
was the second primary fuel consumed by the

households, owning a 27.9 percent share, as 
demand increased by 4.1 percent to 1.7 MTOE 
from 1.6 MTOE in 2010. Food processing and 
sugar production industries needed biomass 
levels of 1.0 MTOE, representing a share of 17.6 
percent of the total industry demand, while 
the aggregate volume of petroleum products 
consumed dropped by 6.1 percent to 1.3 MTOE 
from 1.4 MTOE in the previous year. 
Commercial Sector11
The commercial sector sustained the domestic 
economy amidst the external shocks brought 
by the slowdown in the Eurozone and in the 
US market that crippled commerce and 
trade. However, as the prevailing trend
in other economic sectors, energy use 
in the commercial sector continues to 
increase by 2.9 percent in 2011, although 
this is a significant drop compared to its
previous growth of 10.1 percent. This can 
be attributed to the economic boom in 
the business process outsourcing (BPO) 
industry, including customer services, 
as well as hotels, retail stores and malls 
that are expanding on areas with growing 
populations and improving disposable 
incomes12. Thus, energy consumption 
growth reached 2.66 MTOE in 2010 to 2.74 
MTOE in 2011.

the Certificate of Authority to Import (CAI)
was likewise issued to RRCG Transport System 
and N. Dela Rosa Liner. As another feat in CNG 
infrastructure development, the DOE issued a 
Certificate of Accreditation to the PNOC-EC on
28 June 2011 as a qualified participant to the
NGVPPT for the putting up of the 2nd daughter 
station in Batangas City.
Residential Sector 
Total energy consumption in the residential 
sector dropped by 2.0 percent from its 2010 level 
of 6.1 MTOE to 6.0 MTOE for 2011, which may 
be attributed to the decline in the consumption 
of its three (3) main fuels – biomass, electricity 
and kerosene. The measly 0.2 percent growth in 
household use of LPG was not enough to offset 
the negative growth in the sector’s total 
energy demand. 
Despite the 2.6 percent reduction in biomass 
consumption level of 3.5 MTOE in 2011, it
continues to be a popular choice as primary 
household fuel, particularly among rural 
areas, due to its abundance, availability 
and affordability. Likewise, biomass remain 
to own a hefty share of 58.0 percent of the
total residential demand. Fuelwood was 
the major biomass used, contributing 45.0
percent share to total consumption of the 
sector, followed by charcoal with 9.4 percent 
share, and agriwaste with 3.5 percent share.
Household electricity consumption, which
accounts for 26.8 percent share in the sector’s 
energy demand, dropped by 0.7 percent, from its 
2010 level of 1.62 MTOE to 1.61 MTOE in 2011. 
This may be attributed to increasing awareness 
in energy conservation and the use of more 
energy efficient household appliances due to the
IEC campaign under the Energy Efficiency and
Conservation Program of the Department.
Meanwhile, kerosene consumption 
drastically went down by 12.1 percent to 
111.7 KTOE from its 2010 level of 127.2 
KTOE, as more households prefer cleaner 
and more convenient fuels. Thus, LPG has 
become a viable choice as fuel for cooking 
and lightning purposes, as residential LPG 
demand in 2011 stood at 804.5 KTOE, a
slight increase of 0.2 percent from last 
year’s level of 803.1 KTOE. 
Industry Sector 
In 2011, the industry sector went down 
from second to third biggest energy 
consumer behind transport and residential 
sectors, with 26.0 percent share of the total 
energy demand. The modest growth in industrial 
output of 1.9 percent for the period necessitated 
5.9 MTOE worth of energy, reflecting closely the
sector’s requirement in 2010. 
The manufacturing sub-sector continues

MTOE	   to	   6.0	   MTOE	   for	   2011,	   which	   may	   be	  
attributed	   to	   the	   decline	   in	   the	   consumption	   of	   its	  
three	   (3)	   main	   fuels	   – biomass,	   electricity	   and	  
kerosene.	   The	   measly	   0.2	   percent	   growth	   in

Figure 16. ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF THE COMMERCIAL

major fuels went up in 2011. Electricity, the 
major energyusedinthe sectorwith52.2percent
share in 2011, slightly increased from 1.40 MTOE 
to 1.43 MTOE in 2010 and 2011, respectively. 
While oil products, with a share of 35.8 percent,
registered a 4.1 percent increase which resulted 
to 0.94 MTOE in 2010 to 0.98 MTOE in 2011, as 
diesel, the most utilized oil product in the sector, 
registered higher consumption of 0.63 MTOE 
in 201, from 0.55 MTOE in 2010. Meanwhile,
biomass (including biofuels) with 12.1 percent 
share had a significant increase of 2.2 percent,
reached 0.32 MTOE in 2011. 
Agriculture, Fishery and Forestry (AFF) 
Sector 
The energy requirement of the AFF sector being 
the least energy intensive among economic 
sectors, was considerably cut by 13.0 percent 
from last year’s level of 347.4 KTOE to 302.3 
KTOE in 2011. The decline was triggered by 
the reduction of energy consumption across all 
subsectors for 2011.
As production output from the fishery subsector
declined by 4.0 percent in 2011, its energy 
demand plunged by 16.3 percent to 177.7 
KTOE from 212.2 KTOE in 2010. This was due 
to the effect of successive weather disturbances 
coupled with the rising cost of fuel and operating 
expenses resulting in lower agricultural output 
from both commercial and municipal fisheries.
The agri-industry subsector also suffered a 7.5
percent drop in its energy demand to 123.5
KTOE in 2011 from the previous year’s 133.6 
KTOE as destructive storms that hit the grainsproducing regions of the country in the second 
half of 2011 resulted to lower crop production. 
Similarly, the forestry subsector registered the 
biggest drop in energy consumption of 27.9 
percent to 1.2 KTOE from its year-ago level of 
1.6 KTOE. The stringent process for approval of 
environmental permits has led to the reduction 
in forestry operations that was further supported 
Executive Order (E.O.) 2313 which provided for 
a moratorium on the cutting and harvesting of 
timber in the country.
While petroleum products persists as the sector’s 
primary energy source commanding a share of 
61.6 percent, it posted a decline of 13.6 percent 
from its year-ago level of 215.5 KTOE to 186.1
KTOE in 2011. This is attributed to the drop in 
diesel consumption of 12.5 percent due to the
weakened fishery subsector. Electricity
was the second major fuel with a share of 
38.0 percent, while demand levels stood 
at 114.8 KTOE, a drop of 10.2 percent 
from last year’s 127.9 KTOE.
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
GHG Emission 
The total GHG emission from energyrelated activities reached 73.3 million 
tons of carbon dioxide equivalent 
(MtCO2e) in 2011 from its 2010 level of 
72.8 MtCO2e. The 0.7 percent increase 
was attributed to higher demand for 
fossil fuels in power generation which 
offsets the GHG reduction from other
remaining economic sectors.

GHG emission from all sectors dropped except
for power generation which accounts for 44.1 
percent of the total GHG emission (Figure
18) and at the same time contributed the 
largest chunk equivalent to 32.3 MtCO2e 
(Table 1). It posted a significant increase
of 3.3 percent from its 2010 level of 31.3 
MtCO2e which was mainly driven by higher 
utilization of fossil fuels particularly coal 
and natural gas.
The GHG emission of the transport sector
slightly decreased by 0.9 percent from 
23.0 MtCO2e in 2010 to 22.7 MtCO2e in 
2011 which is attributed to the decrease in 
petroleum demand, but still accounted for 
a substantial share of 31.0 percent to the 
total GHG emission (Table 1).

The energy	  requirement	  of	  the	  AFF	  sector	  being	  the

decline	   was	   triggered	   by	   the	   reduction	   of	   energy	  
consumption	  across	  all	  subsectors	  for	  2011.
As	   production output	   from	   the	   fishery	   subsector	  
declined	  by	  4.0	  percent	  in	  2011,	  its	  energy	  demand

GHG  Emission  
The total	   GHG	   emission	   from	   energy-­‐related	  
activities	   reached	   73.3 million	   tons	   of	   carbon

level	  of	  72.8	  MtCO2e.	  The	  0.7	  percent	  increase	  was	  
attributed	   to	   higher	   demand	   for	   fossil	   fuels	   in	  
power	  generation	  which	  offsets	   the	  GHG	  reduction	  
from	  other	  remaining	  economic	  sectors.	  
GHG	   emission	   from	   all	   sectors	   dropped	   except	   for

Figure 18. GHG EMISSION BY SECTOR AND ACTIVITY 
(in MtCO2e) The same decreasing trend was seen in the 
industry sector, which contributes 15.5
percent to the total GHG emission, posted 11.4
MtCO2e or 2.2 percent lower from its 2010 
level of 11.6 MtCO2e (Table 1). This is mainly 
due to the reduction of petroleum 
consumption for industrial activities. 
Other sectors (commercial, residential 
and agricultural) registered the lowest 
aggregate emission of 5.9 MtCO2e
showing a 0.3 percent decrease 
compared to its 2010 level due to 
the lesser utilization of LPG in the 
commercial sector and partly on the 
decrease of diesel consumption in the 
agricultural sector.
Oil consumption shared almost half of 
the GHG emissions corresponding to
49.0 percent (Figure 19) posting a level 
of 35.9 MtCO2e which is 7.3 percent
lower that its 2010 level. Coal and natural 
gas consumption, on the other hand, 
shared 40.6 percent (29.8 MtCO2e) and 
10.4 percent (7.7 MtCO2e), respectively 
(Table 2). 
GHG Emission per Electricity 
Generation 
The electricity generation emission 
coefficient remained at a range of
0.4 to 0.5 since 2000. The coefficient
continuously posted a modest increase 
from 0.46 tCO2e/MWh in 2010 to 0.47 
tCO2e/MWh in 2011 although there is 
an escalation in fossil fuel utilization for 
power generation signifying possible 
improvements in the thermal efficiency
of fossil-fuelled power plants.
Socio-economic Impact
The CO2 emission per TPES increased, posting 
1.86 tCO2e/TOE from 1.85 tCO2e/TOE which
translated to a minimal rate of 0.4 percent. 
The increase can be attributed to a greater 
consumption of petroleum products particularly 
for power generation. In terms of economic 
requirements, GHG emission intensity fell
by 3.0 percent from 1.28 tCO2e/PhP100K at 
2000 prices from its 2010 level of 1.24 tCO2e/
PhP100K.14 The decrease is an impact of a higher 
change in GDP (3.7 percent growth) rather than 
the change inGHGemission (0.7 percent growth).
Likewise, GHG emission per capita reduced by
1.5 percent from 0.79 tCO2e per person in 2010
to 0.78 tCO2e per person in 2011 (Figure 20).
14 Note that GHG emission intensity is not comparable to 
previous years published intensity level due to change in 
GDP reference period from 1985 base year to 2000 base 
year
Philippine Energy Outlook 2012-2030
KEY ASSUMPTION, PARAMETERS 
AND METHODOLOGIES
The LCS of the PEP serves as the reference case in 
the demand projection of the Philippine Energy 
Outlook 2012-2030. In building the LCS, impacts 
of policy interventions and developments 
on the use of efficient and environmentally
benign end-use technologies in the future are 
simulated (Table 3). It takes into account new 
and existing policies, programs and measures of 
the Philippine government relating to the energy 
sector which are currently being implemented 
and will be pursued within the timeframe of the 
Plan. As such, the virtue of this scenario rests 
on assessing the effects of such measures which 
may evolve either as a consequence of need 
(energy security) or the commercialization of 
energy technologies (economics). On the supply 
side, the PEP uses two (2) scenarios for its 2012-
2030 outlooks. The first scenario simulates how
the future energy supply will evolve given the 
interaction of market forces under a BAU. The 
second one considers the impact of aggressive 
implementation of the plans, programs and 
policies of the government under the LCS of 
supply outlook.
Consistent with the global call to combat and/
or reduce the effects of climate change while 
supporting economic growth and development, 
the Plan adheres to commitment of international 
energy intensity reduction particularly, the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nation’s (ASEAN) 
target of energy intensity reduction of 8.0 
percent by 2015 with 2005 as basis and AsiaPacific Economic Cooperation’s (APEC) target
to reduce APEC’s aggregate energy intensity 
(energy demand per unit of gross domestic 
product - GDP) by 25 percent in 2030 and 45
percent by 2035 with 2005 as the base year.
The base year used for the projections is 2011, 
and the targets of LCS are summarized in Table 3.
The following are the general assumptions on 
the trends of major factors affecting the demand 
for various energy products:
ECONOMIC GROWTH
The average annual growth rate of the country’s 
real GDP from 2001 to 2011 is 4.8 percent, with 
industry15 and services16, both energy-intensive 
sectors, as main drivers of economic growth. On 
the other hand, energy consumption in industry 
and services sectors increased, on the average, 
by 2.8 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively, for 
the past ten (10) years. 
As the country’s economy is expected to benefit
from strong macro- and microeconomic fundamentals, official
governmentfigures17 project real 
GDP to increase by 7.5 percent
in 2012, 6.5 percent in 2013, 6.7
percent in 2014, and 7.5 percent
from 2015 to 2016. Meanwhile,
the Philippines is projected to be 
the world’s top sixteenth (16th) 
economy by year 2050, with the
country’s GDP growing by as 
much 8.4 percent from 2017-
2020, and by 7.3 percent from 
2021-203018.

improvements	   in	   the	   thermal	   efficiency	   of	   fossil-­‐
fuelled	  power	  plants.
Socio-­‐economic  Impact
The CO2	   emission	   per	   TPES	   increased,	   posting	   1.86	  
tCO2e/TOE	   from	   1.85	   tCO2e/TOE	   which	   translated	  
to	   a	  minimal	   rate	   of	   0.4	   percent.	   The	   increase	   can	  
be	   attributed	   to	   a	   greater	   consumption	   of	  
petroleum	   products	   particularly	   for	   power	  
generation.	   	   In	   terms	   of	   economic	   requirements,	  
GHG	  emission	  intensity	  fell	  by	  3.0	  percent	  from	  1.28

a	  higher	  change	  in	  GDP	  (3.7	  percent	  growth)	  rather	  
than	   the	   change	   in	   GHG	   emission	   (0.7	   percent	  
growth).	   	   	   Likewise,	   GHG	   emission	   per capita	  
reduced	  by	  1.5	  percent	  from	  0.79	  tCO2e	  per	  person

Figure 19. GHG EMISSION BY FUEL (in MtCO2e) POPULATION
The Outlook assumes that population shall 
increase from 94.01 million persons in 2010 to 
102.97 million persons in 2015, translating to
an average annual growth rate of 1.8 percent. 
Population growth rate is expected to slow down 
for the succeeding five-year calendar interval to
1.6 percent (2016-2020), 1.5 percent (2020-
2025), and 1.3 percent (2025-2030)19.
OIL PRICES
Crude oil price assumptions in the Outlook 
are based on the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries (OPEC) average crude 
import price, a proxy for international oil prices, 
in its World Oil Outlook (WOO) 2011-2035. It is
assumed to increase from US$109.9/barrel in 
201120 to around US$146/barrel to US$189/
barrel for the next 20 years. 
SECTORAL ENERGY DEMAND 
METHODOLOGIES
The energy demand outlook for this planning 
period considers a wide range of issues and 
trends that could have major implications in 
the country’s energy consumption patterns. 
The readily observable factors include, among 
others: GDP, sectoral gross value-added (GVA) 
and price indices, particularly in industry, 
commercial and agriculture sectors. Relevant 
factors and information that impact on the 
energy consumption for each sector were 
considered in the simulation, specifically:
• Demand levels for Transport, which is 
the most energy-intensive sector, demand 
levels were derived separately for each 
of the four (4) modes of transportation – 
road, rail, air and water. For road transport, 
related indicators used as independent 
variables to project the demand include 
19 Population Projections (Medium Assumptions), National 
Statistics Office
20 Actual 2011 FY priceDOEOil Industry Management Bureau
number of vehicles per type of fuel use, 
fuel efficiency and mileage, fuel conversion,
and GVA. Energy demand projection for rail 
transport used number of passengers for 
the Philippine National Railways (PNR) and 
Metro Rail Transit/Light Rail Transit (MRT/
LRT) lines and population. On the other 
hand, for water and air transport, indicators 
such as number of passengers, kilometer/
ton-kilometer flown, cargo throughput
and sub-sectoral value-added were used in 
energy demand projection. In general, the 
Outlook also incorporates future plans and 
programs of the DOTC, with the foreseen 
development in other related sectors, 
notably local tourism. 
• The Industry sector’s aggregate demand 
was divided into energy intensive and lessenergy intensive industries. Included under 
the energy intensive industries are food 
processing, sugar, paper and pulp industries, 
cement manufacturing, chemicals, basic 
metal and machinery and equipment. 
Meanwhile, other manufacturing activity, 
mining and construction fall under lessenergy intensive industries. Variables such as 
GVA, commodity prices, production targets 
and population were used as indicators for 
energy demand model of these sub-sectors. 
• For the Residential sector, socio-economic 
indicators such as household final
consumption expenditure (HFCE) and
household population were considered in 
calculating energy consumption. Both data 
were sourced from the National Statistics 
Office (NSO).
• For Commercial and Agriculture sectors, 
GVA for trade and services, and agriculture, 
fishery and forestry were used, respectively.
PRIMARY SUPPLY OUTLOOK 
2012-2030
The country’s total primary energy supply (TPES) 
under the BAU scenario will grow at an annual 
average rate of 3.4 percent to reach 73.9 MTOE 
in 2030, from 39.4 million tons of oil equivalent 
(MTOE) in 2011. By end of 2030, coal will be biggest 
fuel in the TPES accounting for an average share of 
30.1 percent in the energy mix (Figure 21).
This is due to the significant share of coal as fuel
requirement in power generation and industrial 
processing, which is anticipated for the 
entire planning period. Oil will be the 
second major fuel with 28.2 percent 
average share after reflecting the
requirements of oil intensive transport 
sector. Likewise, geothermal energy 
considered as one of the major fuel 
inputs in power generation will be 
having a significant share of 18.8 percent
on the average.
Meanwhile, TPES under the LCS will 
reach 77.5 MTOE, 5.0 percent higher as
compared to the BAU, which will grow 
at an average annual of 3.6 percent. The 
difference is due to the increase in the 
production of RE for power generation, 
particularly geothermal energy growing by 
around 4.2 percent across the planning horizon 
from 8.6 MTOE in 2011 to around 18.8 MTOE 
in 2030. The increase is also attributed to the 
growth in natural gas production of 6.9 percent 
across the entire planning period under LCS.
Fossil Fuels
A. Oil 
Total primary oil supply is projected to grow by 
2.1 percent per year under the BAU scenario, 
from 12.4 MTOE in 2011 to 18.3 MTOE in 
2030. Due to transport sector’s 
heavy requirements for oil, it will 
remain among the major fuels in 
the TPES for the next 20 years. 
For the period 2016 to 2030 under 
LCS, growth in total oil supply is 
projected to slow down due to the 
penetration of alternative fuels for 
transport such as electric vehicles, 
CNG (both for taxis and buses) 
and auto-LPG. Implementation 
of higher biofuel blends for both 
diesel and gasoline, which are 
targeted to reach the maximum 
level of 20 percent by 2025, shall
likewise contribute to the slothful requirement 
for oil (Figure 22).
The total oil supply under LCS will grow at 
a slower annual average rate of 1.9 percent 
compared to BAU. 
This	   is	   due	   to the significant share	   of	   coal	   as	   fuel	  
requirement in	   power	   generation and	   industrial	  
processing,	   which	   is	   anticipated	   for	   the	   entire	  
planning	   period.	   	   Oil	   will	   	   be	   the	   second	   major	   fuel	  
with	   28.2 percent	   average	   share after	  reflecting	   the

Figure 22. TOTAL OIL SUPPLY, ACTUAL (LCS VS BAU
Figure 21. TOTAL PRIMARY ENERGY SUPPLY BY FUEL TYPE (LCS VS BAU)B. Coal
Under the BAU, total coal supply will 
increase at a faster rate of 7.2 percent 
annually, from 7.7 MTOE in 2011 
to 28.7 MTOE in 2030 bringing its 
share in the TPES to 38.9 percent in 
2030, from 19.6 percent in 2011. The 
increase in coal supply is due to the 
significant contribution of coal as fuel
input for power generation. Estimated 
aggregated capacities of 9,700MW 
of new coal generating plants will be 
considered within the planning period 
increasing its installed capacity to 
14,600 MW. Further, the upward trend 
in coal supply is also attributed to 
increasing requirements of industry, specifically
for cement and basic metals production (Figure 
23).
However, coal supply under the LCS will increase
at a slower rate of 4.8 percent, reaching 18.9 
MTOE level, with a lower average share to TPES 
of 25.2 percent compared to that of BAU. This
is due to the government’s efforts in promoting 
the utilization of renewable energy and cleaner 
fuels in power generation for environmental 
considerations.
C. Natural Gas 
Under the BAU, natural gas is 
projected to increase by 4.9 percent 
annually across the entire planning 
horizon, from 3.3 MTOE in 2011 
to 8.2 MTOE in 2030 (Figure 24). 
The country’s gas supply outlook 
will still be largely hinged on the 
production of the Malampaya 
field, including additional gas
(uncontracted gas) until 2025. 
Aside from the Libertad gas field
in Cebu which started commercial production 
in 2010, potential gas fields foreseen to produce
commercially within the next 20 years include 
San Martin by 2015, Sultan sa Barongis and
Sampaguita by 2023, Sulu Sea by 2025, among
others. 
Meanwhile, natural gas supply will grow faster 
under LCS growing at an annual average rate 
of 6.9 percent to reach 11.5 MTOE in 2030.
Assuming realization of production targets, 
the growth will also be largely due to the 
government’s effort to promote the utilization 
of green fuel for power generation (green fuel 
means RE plus natural gas).
Renewable Energy
RE will account for an annual average share of 
32.6 percent across the planning period (Figure 
21). The supply of RE will grow slightly at an 
average rate of 0.8 percent per year under the 
BAU, from 16.0 MTOE in 2011 to 18.7 MTOE in 
2030 (Figure 25). On the other hand, under the
LCS, its contribution to TPES will improve to 3.2 
percent average growth rate, reaching 29.3 MTOE 
in 2030. 
Geothermal energy will continue to be the 
country’s major RE resource, accounting for 
58.5 percent of the total RE supply in the BAU.
Geothermal energy production will reach 10.9 
MTOE in 2030 from 8.6 MTOE in 2011, which 
translates to an average annual growth of 1.3 
percent across the entire planning period. A 
total of 220 MW of additional geothermal power 
capacities will be online within the next 20 
years thus, expanding its total installed capacity 
to 2,003 MW. On the other hand, supply of 
geothermal energy in LCS will reach to around 
18.8 MTOE, more than doubling its 2011 level of 
8.6 MTOE, and garnering 64.0 percent of total RE. 
Under the NREP, geothermal energy capacity in 
power generation shall increase by 75.0 percent
at the end of 2030.
Within the next 20 years under the BAU, hydropower 
supply will register a modest growth of 0.6 percent 
per year, from 2.4 MTOE in 2011 to 2.6 MTOE in 
2030. The commissioning of hydro power projects 
within the planning period will be bringing an 
additional installed capacity of 3,535
MW. For the period 2012-2030, 
hydropower will constitute an annual 
average share of around 4.8 percent to 
the total primary energy supply, while 
under the LCS its share will reach up 
to 5.7 percent, where its supply will
grow to 4.6 MTOE in 2030, for yearly 
average rate of 3.5 percent. By end of
2030 under the BAU, it will be expected 
that around 2.9 MTOE of fuel input for 
power generation will be sourced from 
hydropower while its fuel input under 
the LCS will be around 4.6 MTOE.
Combined supply level of solar and 
wind under the BAU is projected to 
increase at an average rate of 5.9 percent per
year, from 7.7 KTOE in 2011 to almost 22.9 KTOE 
in 2030. The level of supply of these sources of 
energy under the LCS will be remarkably high to 
increase at an average growth rate of 20.4 percent 
annually bringing combined solar and wind 
supply to around 263.7 KTOE in 2030. The policy 
mechanisms set under the RE law to include the 
Feed-in-Tariff (FIT) and the Renewable Portfolio 
Standards (RPS), among others, will serve as 
a catalyst to the rapid increase on the level of 
supply of these sources of energy. 
Biomass21 share in the RE supply mix under the 
BAU scenario will remain to be the second highest 
to account for an annual average contribution of 
20.3 percent , albeit its declining supply levels, 
from 4.9 MTOE in 2011 to 2.7 MTOE in 2030 or 
a negative growth of 3.1 percent per year (Figure 
25). It can be noted that the drop in biomass
supply stems from the residential sector’s 
decreasing demand for this fuel at around 10.3 
percent annually, particularly fuel demand 
for household cooking and heating. However,
biomass supply in power generation will grow 
considerably at an annual average rate of 6.4 
percent due to additional capacities of biomassfed power plants that will be put up within the 
planning period.

B. Coal
Under	   the	   BAU,	   total	   coal	   supply	   will	   increase at	   a	  
faster	  rate	  of	  7.2	  percent	  annually,	  from	  7.7	  MTOE	  in	  
2011	   to	   28.7	  MTOE	   in	   2030	   bringing	   its	  share	   in the	  
TPES to	   38.9 percent	   in	   2030,	   from	   19.6	   percent	   in	  
2011.	   	   The	   increase	   in	   coal supply	   is	   due	   to	   the	  
significant	  contribution	  of coal	  as	  fuel	  input	  for	  power	  
generation.	   Estimated aggregated	   capacities of	  
9,700MW	   of	   new	   coal	   generating	   plants will	   be	  
considered	   within	   the	   planning	   period	  
increasing	  its	  installed	  capacity	  to	  14,600 MW.	  	  
Further,	  the	  upward	  trend	  in	  coal	  supply	  is	  also	  
attributed	   to	   increasing requirements	   of	  
industry,	   specifically	   for	   cement	   and	   basic	  
metals	  production	  (Figure	  23).

increase	   at	   a	   slower	   rate	   of	   4.8 percent,	  
reaching	   18.9	   MTOE	   level,	   with	   a	   lower	  
average	   share	   to	   TPES	   of	   25.2	   percent	  
compared	   to	   that	   of	   BAU.	   	   This	   is	   due to	   the	  
government’s	   efforts	   in	   promoting	   the

scenario	   will	   remain to	   be	   the	   second	   highest	   to
account	   for	   an	   annual	   average	   contribution of	   20.3
percent	   	   ,	   albeit	   its declining	   supply	   levels,	   from	   4.9	  
MTOE	   in	   2011	   to	   2.7 MTOE	   in	   2030	   or	   a	   negative	  
growth	   of	   3.1 percent	   per	   year (Figure	   5).	   	   It	   can	   be	  
noted	  that	  the	  drop	  in	  biomass	  supply	  stems from	  the	  
residential	  sector’s	  decreasing	  demand	  for	  this	  fuel	  at
around	   10.3 percent	   annually,	   particularly	   fuel	  
demand	   for	   household	   cooking	   and	   heating.	  	  	  
However,	   biomass	   supply	   in	   power	   generation	   will	  
grow	   considerably	   at	   an	   annual	   average	   rate	   of	   6.4	  
percent due	   to	   additional	   capacities	   of	   biomass-­‐fed
power	   plants	  that	  will	  be	   put	   up	  within	   the	   planning	  
period.
Meanwhile	  under	  the	  LCS,	  biomass	  supply	  will	  take	  as	  
much	   as	   7.1 percent	   by	   of	   the	   total	   primary	   energy

 Figure 25. TOTAL RE SUPPLY, ACTUAL (LCS AND BAU) Meanwhile under the LCS, biomass supply will 
take as much as 7.1 percent by of the total primary 
energy supply end of 2030 compared to the 6.8 
percent share under the BAU. Correspondingly, 
the negative growth of biomass supply will 
slightly improve to a negative 2.1 percent due to 
its utilization for power generation. 
Alternative Fuels
A. Biodiesel
Biodiesel supply under both scenarios is expected 
to reach 1.8 MTOE in 2030 from its 2011 level 
of 115.5 KTOE growing at an annual average
rate of 15.5 percent. Biodiesel’s contribution
to the TPES is also expected to increase from 
0.3 percent share in 2011 to 2.4 percent share 
in 2030. The target biodiesel blend, which will 
increase over the planning period under the 
biomass roadmap22 of the NREP, requires a total 
biodiesel supply of 0.4 MTOE in 
2016, 0.8 MTOE in 2020, and 1.7 
MTOE in 2025.
B. Bioethanol
While the move to increase utilization 
of environment-friendly fuels is 
further strengthened, bioethanol 
blend is projected to increase to a 
maximum blend of 20 percent in 
2025. Over the planning horizon,
bioethanol production under both 
scenarios is projected to grow at an 
average rate of 9.5 percent, reflected
fromits level of107.5KTOEin2011to
597.9 KTOE in 2030. Meanwhile, the
energy sector’s aggressive target of 
up to 85 percent bioethanol blend is still under
research and development stage.
GHG EMISSION
Given the dynamics of energy demand under the 
BAUscenario,total GHG emission from fossil fuels
22 From the existing mandated 2.0% blend , biodiesel blend will 
increase to 5.0% starting 2015; 10% starting 2020; and, 20% 
starting 2025 onwards
(oil, coal and natural gas) is foreseen to increase 
at 4.5 percent per year across the planning
period, from 72.9 MtCO2e in 2011 to 168.2 
MtCO2 in 2030. Emission from the consumption 
of coal fuels shall account for an annual average 
rate of 54.5 percent of the total GHG emission,
while those from oil-based fuels will account for 
an annual average share of 35.9 percent, with
natural gas contributing 9.6 percent..
Over the planning period, half or around 
52.0 percent of the total emission will come
from the transformation sector or electricity 
generation. Meanwhile, from among the energy 
end-use sectors, transport will account for the 
biggest share to the total GHG emission around
translating to an annual average share of 24.7 
percent, followed by industry comprising more 
than 16.4 percent, while around 6.8 percent will 
come from other sectors such as commercial, 
residential and agriculture (Figure 26). 
Meanwhile, under the LCS, the total GHG drop
to 137.1 MtCO2e in 2030, while growth slows 
down at an annual average rate of 3.4 percent 
over the planning horizon. Although bulk of 
the emission will come from the electricity 
generation sector, its share to the total GHG shall
be lower at 48.6 percent only, vis-à-vis its 52.5
percent share under the BAU.
FINAL ENERGY DEMAND 
OUTLOOK 2012 - 2030
TOTAL FINAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION (TFEC)
Under the LCS, the country’s TFEC is expected 
to increase at an average rate of 2.8 percent 
annually from 2011 to 2030. The total energy 
demand level is expected grow steadily from 
23.0 MTOE in 2011 to 39.1 MTOE in 2030 at 
an annual average growth rate of 2.8 percent. 
Energy consumption is projected to increase at 
a slower pace of 1.4 percent from 2011 to 2016, 
picking up from 2016-2020 at an average of 3.4 
percent, down to 3.2 percent per 
year for 2020-2025, and up by 3.5
percent for 2025-2030 (Figure 27).
Although the transport sector’s 
energy demand will be tapered 
down with the penetration of 
more efficient fuels, it will remain
to be the biggest energy consumer 
in terms of average share across 
the entire planning horizon at 
35.5 percent share. On the other
hand, the industry sector is seen to 
account for much of the increase in 
the country’s TFEC between 2011 
and 2030. It will surpass the residential sector’s 
energy demand to become the second largest 
energy consumer, with an average share of 33.7 
percent from 2012 to 2030. This consumption 
pattern will bring the household sector’s energy 
demand to reduced share of 17.9 percent share 
during the planning period. Meanwhile, the 
commercial sector which is considered to be the 
major driver of the country’s economic growth 
in the next 20 years, will hold an average share 
of 11.9 percent. While the agriculture (including 
fishery and forestry - AFF) sector will remain to
be the least energy user with 0.9 percent average 
share of the total energy demand (Figure 28). 
Energy use in the industry sector 
will grow most rapidly at 5.1 percent
annually, spurred by the foreseen 
increase in the activities of the 
manufacturing sector. The energy 
requirements of the commercial sector 
combined with trade and services will 
expand by 2.7 percent on the average. 
Meanwhile, the increased utilization 
of alternative fuels will result to a 
2.9 percent increase in the transport 
sector’s energy use. On the other 
hand, the residential and AFF sectors’ 
levels of demand will exhibit an annual 
average contraction of 0.6 percent and 
0.8 percent, respectively.

Figure 27. TOTAL FINAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION BY SECTOR
Figure 28. TOTAL FINAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION BY SECTOR
 SHARE (ACTUAL 2000-2011, LCS 2012-2030)Oil will remain as the country’s major fuel, with an 
average share of 43.5 percent of the total energy
demand (Figure 29). The country’s dependence 
on petroleum, in spite of foreseen increases of oil 
prices in the international market, will continue 
as demand increases by an average of 1.4 percent 
per year, from 2011 to 2030. Among 
petroleum products, aviation gasoline 
consumption will grow the fastest, at 8.9 
percent per year, with the heightened 
interest in local tourism. Meanwhile, 
diesel and gasoline will continue to 
be the most widely-used petroleum 
products, with average shares of 20.1 
percent and 10.1 percent in the total 
oil demand, respectively. Transport 
will remain as the major petroleum 
consuming sector with an average share 
of 67.9 percent in the total oil demand 
for the entire planning period. 
The NREP’s targets on increasing 
mandated biofuels blend for gasoline 
and diesel products will increase total 
biofuel demand from 0.2 MTOE in 2011 
to 2.0 MTOE in 2030. Increasing the 
ethanol and biodiesel blend of gasoline 
and diesel, respectively, by 20 percent in 2030 
will expand demand for biofuels by as much as 
12.4 percent per year. The higher consumption 
of biofuels is projected to consequently lessen 
the volume of demand for petroleum 
products by as much as 6.0 percent for 
the next 20 years.
Electricity will contribute an average of 
22.9 percent share to the final energy
demand across the entire planning 
horizon, making it the second-most 
consumed fuel after oil. Electricity 
consumption is projected to grow by 
an average of 3.8 percent annually over 
the entire planning horizon. Its use in 
the transport sector is seen to expand 
remarkably, from its 2011 level of 10 
KTOE to as much as 1.1 MTOE in 2030 
due to expected government’s extension 
and expansion plans for the light rail 
system (MRT and LRT), possible addition 
of other mass transit systems, and the entry of 
electric vehicles. The industry sector will constitute 
the largest portion of electricity demand at 32.4 
percent average share, followed closely by the 
residential sector with 32.0 percent (Figure 30).
End-use demand (non-power application) for 
coal is expected to increase by 7.8 percent on the 
average, owning a 13.5 percent share to the final
energy demand across the entire planning period. 
Its consumption will increase more than four times 
its 2011 level of 1.8 MTOE, to 7.6 MTOE in 2030. 
The rise in coal consumption can be attributed 
to the projected increase in the production of 
cement and basic metals which are used as 
construction materials for public and private 
sector infrastructures. 
Availability of efficient technologies, particularly
end-use equipment for household cooking using 
LPG and electricity will pave the way for reduction 
in the use of traditional fuels, and as such, end-use 
biomass consumption is projected to post a constant 
decline in the next 20 years. Its consumption will 
fall from its 2011 level of 4.8 MTOE to 2.6 MTOE in 
2030, translating to an average yearly decline of 3.3 
percent. The residential sector, as the major user of 
biomass, is seen to significantly contribute to the
reduction in biomass demand. Household usage
of biomass will drop by as much as 50.6 in terms
of levels – from 3.5 MTOE in 2011 to 0.4 MTOE
in 2030 or at an average rate of 10.3 percent per 
year. However, there will be a noticeable increase
of 2.5 percent and 1.7 percent for industrial and
commercial biomass usage, respectively, during 
the planning period. 
Lastly, end-use demand for natural gas will expand 
by 19.6 percent per year due to increased 
requirements from the transport, industry 
and commercial sectors. The CNG-fueled 
vehicles would total to 31,00023 units by 
2030. Natural gas is also expectedto figure
prominently as a fuel – it shall be used in 
several industrial parks, particularly in 
South Luzon, as well as in other emerging 
industrial parks. Aside from this, natural 
gas technology is also expected to be used 
for cooling commercial centers, such as 
large shopping malls.
TOTAL FINAL ENERGY 
CONSUMPTION, BY SECTOR
Transport Sector 
The transport sector will continue to dominate 
the country’s total energy demand, with an 
23 15000 CNG bus and 16000 CNG taxi by 2030
annual average share of 35.5 percent in the
TFEC. Its energy requirement is projected to 
grow at an annual average of 2.9 percent, from 
its demand level of 8.0 MTOE in 2011 to 13.6 
MTOE in 2030. The bulk of the sector’s energy 
demand will be used for land transport, where 
about 80.0 percent of domestic traffic and 60.0
percent of freight traffic is by land24. 
With the projected annual increase in vehicle 
registration of 4.4 percent25, where 40.0 percent 
of the national total is registered vehicles in 
Metro Manila26, oil will remain as the sector’s 
major fuel, constituting the bulk (83.3 percent) 
of the sector’s total energy requirement for the 
next 20 years. Diesel will account for nearly half 
of oil demand at 42.0 percent share . However,
a significant volume of its consumption will
be displaced due to the projected entry of 
additional CNG-fueled buses and significant
increase in biodiesel blend, causing an annual 
average reduction in the diesel demand of 0.4 
percent (Figure 31). 
Gasoline is the second major fuel of the 
sector. Due to increased penetration of autoLPG, electric vehicles (including e-trikes and 
hybrid vehicles) and significant increase in

The	   NREP’s	   targets	   on	   increasing	   mandated	   biofuels

the	   largest	   portion	   of	   electricity	   demand	   at	   32.4
percent	   average	   share,	   followed	   closely	   by	   the	  
residential	  sector	  with	  32.0 percent	  (Figure	  30).
End-­‐use	   demand	   (non-­‐power	   application)	   for	  
coal	   is	   expected	   to	   increase	   by	   7.8	   percent	   on	  
the	  average,	  owning	  a	  13.5 percent	  share	  to	  the

MTOE	  in	  2030.	  The	  rise	  in	  coal	  consumption	  can

SECTOR
Transport Sector
The	  transport	  sector	  will	  continue	  to	  dominate	  the	  
country’s	   total	   energy	   demand,	   with	   	   an	   annual	  
average	   share	   of	   35.5	   percent	   in	   the	   TFEC.	   Its	  	  
energy	   requirement	   is	   projected	   to	   grow	   at	   an	  
annual	  average	  	  of	  2.9	  percent,	  from	  its	  demand	  level	  
of	  8.0	  MTOE	  in	  2011	  to	  13.6	  MTOE	  in	  2030.	  The	  bulk	  
of	   the	   sector’s	  energy	   demand	  will	   be	   used	  	   for	  land	  
reduction	  in	  the	  diesel	  demand	  of	  0.4	  percent	  (Figure	  
31).	  
Gasoline	  is	   the	  second	  major	   fuel	  of	   the	  sector.	  	  Due	  
to	  increased	  penetration	  of	  auto-­‐LPG,	  electric	  vehicles	  
(including	  e-­‐trikes	  and	  hybrid	  vehicles)	  and	  significant	  
increase	   in	   the	   bioethanol	   blend,	   gasoline	  
consumption	  is	  expected	  to	  post	  a	  sluggish	  growth	  	  of	  
0.7	   	   percent	   annually	   during	   the	   entire	   planning	  
periodtoreach33MTOEin2030
Figure 31. TRANSPORT ENERGY DEMANDthe bioethanol blend, gasoline consumption 
is expected to post a sluggish growth of 0.7 
percent annually during the entire planning 
period, to reach 3.3 MTOE in 2030. 
Given the vulnerability of global oil prices to 
geopolitical tensions and the growing concern 
on sustainable development, the DOE will 
continue to intensify its campaign for the 
utilization of cleaner alternative fuels in the 
transport sector. Demand for bioethanol will 
expand by 9.1 percent per year on the average, 
reaching 0.5 MTOE, by the end of the planning
period. Meanwhile, demand for 
biodiesel is seen to increase by 13.7 
percent per year for the next two 
decades. 
Largely due to further developments 
in the country’s light railway 
systems, specifically: the capacity
expansion and modernization of 
Line 1; Line 2 East and West route 
expansion; NAIA rail link and North 
& Cavite route expansion projects27
and the expected entry of e-trikes 
and other e-vehicles, electricity 
demand will expand to reach 1.1 
MTOE by 2030, at an average 
growth rate of 28.1 percent per 
year across the planning horizon. 
With the targeted commercialization of a total 
of 15,000 CNG-buses and 16,000 CNG-taxis
plying the major routes nationwide by 2030, 
natural gas use in the transport sector will grow 
substantially to reach 1.2 MTOE in 2030, from a 
mere 1 KTOE in 2011. 
Industrial Sector
Following the development trajectory of 
similarly-situated economies, the Philippine 
government likewise announced its thrust to 
inject timely economic stimulus packages to 
ensure the country’s full economic recovery28. 
27 LRTA Website (@lrta.gov.ph)
28 Global Agricultural Information Network, USDA Foreign 
Agricultural Services
Consequently, the industrial sector’s energy 
requirement will intensify than expected. 
As an engine of growth in the country’s 
economy, the industry sector is projected to 
expand the fastest in terms of its energy demand 
at an annual average rate of 5.1 percent and an
average share of 33.7 percent in the country’s 
total final energy demand for the next 20 years
(Figure 32). This will translate to a demand level 
going up from 5.9 MTOE in 2011 to 15.3 MTOE
in 2030. 
Industry will remain as the major end-use 
consumer of coal, owning an average share of 
39.3 percent of the sector’s energy requirement 
over the entire planning horizon. This is largely 
due to the projected increase in coal utilization 
of cement and basic metals industries to meet 
the increasing demand for building materials in 
the construction sector. Likewise, coal demand 
in paper production, beverages and other food 
production is also projected to increase during 
the 20-year planning horizon. Coal consumption 
in industry is projected to expand by an average 
rate of 7.8 percent per year, to reach 7.6 MTOE 
in 2030 from 1.8 MTOE in 2011. 
Electricity will remain as the second major 
energy source in industry, taking up an average 
share of 22.1 percent of the sector’s total energy
demand. Machinery/equipment and basic metal 
production are the top industrial electricity 
consumers, followed by textile/apparel and 
other food production. Total electricity demand 
of the sector is projected to grow by an average 
of 3.4 percent, reaching 3.2 MTOE in 2030 from 
1.7 MTOE in 2011. 
Notwithstanding its price volatility and the 
projected energy savings, oil will continue to 
play an important role in fueling the activities 
of the industry sector, accounting for an average 
of 14.9 percent share of the sector’s total energy
demand over the planning period. It will 
increase at an average rate of 0.9 percent per 
year, to reach 1.6 MTOE in 2030 from 1.3 MTOE 
in 2011. Bulk of this demand will comprise of 
fuel oil and diesel, registering an average shares 
of 7.4 percent and 6.4 percent, respectively. 
The incessant increase in the price of oil products 
will likewise prompt industry players to pursue 
intensely the utilization of other energy sources 
to cope up with increasing production volume. 
Thus, biomass will still be an important fuel 
source for the sector, particularly 
in sugar production, food and 
other manufacturing industries. 
Total biomass consumption of 
industry is expected to increase to 
1.7 MTOE in 2030, accounting for 
an average share of 17.3 percent of 
the total industry energy demand 
over the planning period. 
Residential Sector
The residential sector is the third 
largest consuming sector, with 
an average share of 17.5 percent
in the country’s total energy 
consumption during the planning 
period. As of 201029, the total 
number of households across the 
country has reached 18.5 million, with an average
of about 5 (4.8) family members per household30. 
29 National Statistics Office (NSO) 2010 Census of Population and 
Housing
30 National Statistics Office (NSO) Special Release No2011005
With the projected household growth rate of 
2.04 percent31 per year, the total number of 
households is expected to reach 28.7 million 
in 2030. Notwithstanding, the energy demand 
level of households will decline by 0.6 percent 
between 2011 and 2030 (Figure 33). This may 
be attributed to foreseen reduction in biomass 
consumption of households, coupled with 
increased energy saving measures promoted in 
the sector. However, the reduction will be slightly
offset by the expected increase in the utilization 
more efficient fuels for cooking, such as LPG visà-vis traditional fuels, thus, reducing the sector’s 
biomass demand especially among the middle 
and upper income families. 
Electricity demand in the sector will increase its 
average share by 58.5 percent in 2030 from 26.8
percent in 2011, replacing biomass as the primary 
fuel of the sector, as the former is expected to 
contract at an annual average rate of 10.3 percent 
over the planning period, from 3.5 MTOE in 2011
to 442 KTOE in 2030, with a reduced share to 
household energy demand of only 8.3 percent. 
This decline is seen to be caused by the changing 
patterns of fuel preference among consumers for 
household activities such as cooking and heating,

Residential  Sector
The	   residential	   sector	   is	   the	   third	   largest	   consuming	  
sector,	   with	   an	   average	   share	   of	   17.5	   percent	   in	   the	  
country’s	   total	   energy	   consumption	   during	   the	  
planning	   period. As	   of	   201029, the	   total	   number	   of	  
households	   across	   the	   country	   has	   reached	   18.5	  
million,	   with	   an	   average	   of	   about	   5	   (4.8)	  
family	  members	  per	  household30.	  	  With	  the	  
projected	   household	   growth	   rate	   of	   2.04	  
percent31 per	   year,	   	   the	   total	   number	   of	  
households	   is	   expected	   to	   reach	   28.7	  
million	   in	   2030.	   Notwithstanding,	   the	  
energy	   demand	   level	   of	   households	   will	  	  
decline	   by	   0.6	   percent	   between	   2011	   and	  
2030	  (Figure	  33).	  This	  may	  be	  attributed	  to	  
foreseen	   reduction in	   biomass	  
consumption	   of	   households,	   coupled	   with	  
increased	   energy	   saving	   measures	  
promoted	   in	   the	   sector.	   However,	   the	  
reduction	   will	   be	   slightly	   offset	   by	   the	  
expected	   increase	   in	   the	   utilization	   more	  
efficient	   fuels	   for	  cooking,	  such	  as	  LPG	  vis-­‐
à-­‐vis	   traditional	   fuels,	   thus,	   reducing	   the	  
sector’s	  biomass	  demand	  especially	  among	  
the	  middle	  and	  upper	  income	  families.	  
Electricity	   demand	   in	   the	   sector	   will	   increase	   its	  
average	   share	   by	   58.5	   percent	   in	   2030	   from	   26.8

Figure 33. RESIDENTIAL ENERGY DEMANDand the shifting to more efficient and convenient
fuels and energy sources such as LPG and 
electricity. Based on the 2004 Household Energy
Consumption Survey (HECS), household users
of biomass declined from 29.2 percent in 1995
to 18.7 percent or an annual average negative 
growth of 4.8 percent. Particularly, it was noted 
that the proportion of household using fuelwood 
(63.5 percent to 55.1 percent) and charcoal (38.5
percent to 34.2 percent) went down compared to 
the 1995 HECS. Accordingly, electricity demand
is expected to increase by 3.6 percent per year, 
while use of LPG will post an annual average 
growth rate of 4.1 percent, with 
substantial share of 25.0 percent to the
sector’s total energy demand. 
Commercial Sector 
With local and foreign investors’ 
boost in confidence and optimism
attributed to increasing political 
stability in the country, the outlook 
for the commercial sector remains 
promising. The continuous upsurge 
in the number of business process 
outsourcing companies (BPOs), 
establishing their headquarters in 
the country, and major investment 
properties such as office, retail and
hotel as well as residential property32
are foreseen as major contributors for the 
sector’s increasing energy demand. Thus, the 
sector’s energy requirement will increase by 
a staggering 69.9 percent, from 2.6 MTOE in 
2011 to 4.6 MTOE in 2030, growing at an annual 
average rate of 2.7 percent.
Electricity will remain as the major energy source 
in the sector constituting more than half (51.9
percent on the average) of the total commercial 
demand. The demand for electricity services will 
increase at an annual rate of 2.8 percent throughout 
the planning period (Figure 24).

Total petroleum demand will generally have 
a steady average annual growth of 2.0 percent 
during the entire planning period. LPG and fuel 
oil demand, owing to the rise in the output of 
establishments engaged in food and other related 
services, is projected to increase annually by 1.6 
and 1.5 percent, respectively. Diesel demand
will still post a substantial growth rate of 2.3 
percent. Expectedly, commercial sector will 
experience growth in biodiesel demand from 
13 KTOE in 2011, to 232 KTOE in 2030, as the 
mandatory blend escalates from 2 percent in 
2011 to 20 percent from 2025 to 2030.
Meanwhile, the consumption of biomass in the 
commercial sector, particularly fuel wood and 
charcoal, will still be prominent among food 
establishments and restaurants mainly for 
commercial cooking and heating. Its levels will 
fairly grow by 1.7 percent per annum within the 
planning period from 318 KTOE in 2011. 
Agriculture, Fishery and Forestry (AFF) Sector
The 2.3 percent growth33 of the AFF sector in 2011 
was largely contributed by crops, livestock and 
poultry sub-sectors despite the decline in fisheries
production. However, the AFF sector will

Electricity	   will	   remain	   as	   the	   major	   energy	   source	   in	  
the	   sector	   constituting	   more	   than	   half	   (51.9	   percent	  
on	  the	  average)	  of	  the	  total	  commercial	  demand.	  The

Agriculture,  Fishery  and  Forestry  (AFF) Sector
The	   2.3 percent	   growth33 of	   the	   AFF	   sector	   in	   2011	  
was	   largely	   contributed	   by	   crops,	   livestock	   and	  
poultry	   sub-­‐sectors	   despite	   the	   decline	   in	   fisheries	  
production.	  However,	   the	  AFF	  sector	  will	  continue	   to	  
be	   the	   least	   energy-­‐intensive	   among	   the	   economic	  
sectors	  accounting	   for	  a	  meager	  share	  of	  1.0	  percent	  
in	   the	   total	   energy	   demand.	   In	   spite	   of	   the	  
sector’s	  growth,	  energy	  demand	  levels	  will	  drop,	  
from	   302	   kTOE	   in	   2011	   to	   260	   kTOE,	   or	   an	  
average	  yearly	  decline	  of	  0.8	  percent
Energy	   demand	   in	   the	   AFF	   sector	   is	   comprised	  
of:	  (1)	  petroleum	  products,	  used	  mainly	  for	  farm	  
equipment,	   crop	   production	   and	   fishery;	   (2)	  
electricity,	   largely	   used	   in	   the	   livestock	   and	  
poultry	   sub-­‐sector;	  and,	   (3)	   biodiesel	  which	  is	  a	  
mandatory	   input	   to	   diesel	   categorized	   under	  
petroleum	   products	   used	   for	   farm	   machineries	  
and	   implements.	   Petroleum	   products	   will	  
account	  for	  a	  commanding	  47.6	  percent	  average	  
share;	   followed	   closely	   by	  electricity,	  which	  will	  
take	   up	   as	   much	   as	   47.5	   percent	   share,	   and	  
biodiesel	  with	  4.8	  percent	  share.	  
Over	  the	  planning	  period,	  the	  sector	  will	  remain	  
to	   be	   heavily	   dependent	   on	   petroleum	   products,	  
despite	  demand	  levels	  declining	  at	  an	  average	  rate	  of	  
3.1	   percent,	   from	   186	   kTOE	   in	   2011	   to	   102	   kTOE	   in	  
2030.	   Electricity	   demand,	   on	   other	   hand,	   will	   post	   a	  
moderate	   increase	   of	   0.8 percent	   on	   the	   average,	  
from	  its	  2011	  level	  of	  115	  kTOE	  to	  134	  kTOE	  by	  2030.	  
The	  increasing	  growth	  in	  the	  demand	  for	  electricity	  is	  
due	   to	   the	   planned	   major	   construction	   and	  
restoration	   of	   national	   irrigation	   systems	   and	  
improvement	   of	   rural	   infrastructure	   facilities	   in	   the	  
sector.	   Meanwhile,	   biodiesel	   demand	   will	   grow	  
fastest	  at	  an	  average	   rate	   of	   16.0	  percent	  across	   the	  
planning	   period,	   increasing	   to	   23	   KTOE	   by	   2030,	  
almost	  10	  times	  its	  2011	  level	  of	  1	  kTOE	  (Figure	  25).
 
33 Bureau	  of	  Agriculture	  Statistics,	  Performance	  of	  Philippine	  Agriculture
continue to be the least energy-intensive among 
the economic sectors accounting for a meager 
share of 1.0 percent in the total energy demand. In 
spite of the sector’s growth, energy demand levels 
will drop, from 302 KTOE in 2011 to 260 KTOE, or 
an average yearly decline of 0.8 percent
Energy demand in the AFF sector is comprised 
of: (1) petroleum products, used mainly for farm 
equipment, crop production and fishery; (2)
electricity, largely used in the livestock and poultry 
sub-sector; and, (3) biodiesel which is a 
mandatory input to diesel categorized 
under petroleum products used for 
farm machineries and implements. 
Petroleum products will account for 
a commanding 47.6 percent average 
share; followed closely by electricity, 
which will take up as much as 47.5
percent share, and biodiesel with 4.8 
percent share. 
Over the planning period, the sector 
will remain to be heavily dependent on 
petroleum products, despite demand 
levels declining at an average rate of 
3.1 percent, from 186 KTOE in 2011 to 
102 KTOE in 2030. Electricity demand, 
on other hand, will post a moderate increase of 0.8 
percent on the average, from its 2011 level of 115
KTOE to 134 KTOE by 2030. The increasing growth 
in the demand for electricity is due to the planned 
major construction and restoration of national 
irrigation systems and improvement of rural 
infrastructure facilities in the sector. Meanwhile, 
biodiesel demand will grow fastest at an average 
rate of 16.0 percent across the planning period, 
increasing to 23 KTOE by 2030, almost 10 times its 
2011 level of 1 KTOE (Figure 25).
Figure 25. AFF ENERGY DEMANDIII. ENERGY RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT
Fossil Fuels 
Fossil fuels (oil, gas and coal) will still remain as dominant sources of energy to meet the growing 
global energy demand. The 2011 World Energy Outlook of the International Energy Agency (IEA) 
shows that over the next 20 years, fossil fuels will continue to see strong growth particularly in the 
electric power sector. In the ASEAN region, fossil fuels will exhibit the same share to the primary 
energy requirements by 2030 as noted in the 3rd ASEAN Energy Demand Outlook (2010). 
Given these long-term energy supply 
projection, the government will continue 
its efforts to harness the country’s 
indigenous oil, gas and coal resources to 
ensure greater energy supply security. 
A. OIL AND GAS
In view of the volatility of oil prices in the 
world market brought about by a confluence
of factors, obtaining more oil and gas 
resources from domestic sources is essential 
in reducing the country’s oil import bill. This 
has been a challenge affecting the economy 
and as such, the government puts premium 
in facilitating investments to explore new 
sources of oil and gas. 
Performance Assessment
The country has 16 sedimentary basins 
with combined potential of 4,777 million 
barrels of fuel oil equivalent (MMBFOE) 
(689.8 MTOE) of oil and gas reserves. 
These basins, which have an aggregate 
area of 14,000 square kilometers (sq. 
kms.) as shown in Figure 36, are as follows: 
(1) Northwest Palawan; (2) Southwest 
Palawan; (3) Mindoro-Cuyo; (4) Recto (Reed) 
Bank; (5) Visayan; (6) Southeast Luzon; (7)
Cagayan; (8) Cotabato; (9) Sulu Sea; (10) Ilocos 
Trough; (11) West Luzon; (12) Central Luzon; 
(13) Bicol Shelf; (14) West Masbate-Iloilo; (15)
East Palawan; and (16) Agusan-Davao. 
The energy sector has aggressively pursued the 
exploration and development of indigenous oil 
and gas resources through the conduct of the 
PECR34. To date, 27 SCs are being supervised 
and monitored by the DOE (Table 4). Some of 
these SCs contribute investments amounting 
to nearly US$ 80 million in their first seven (7)
years of exploration activities in their respective 
areas. To attract potential investors, the DOE 
34 PECR is a mechanism whereby the government bids out areas 
with potential indigenous energy reserves (e.g .coal, oil and gas) 
for exploration and possible development and production
conducted four (4) investment roadshows in 
2011 in Singapore, Australia, Italy and the USA 
prior to the official launching of the PECR-4 held
on 30 June 2011 in Manila. The aim of the PECR 
is to provide transparent and competitive system 
of tendering onshore and offshore oil and gas 
blocks for exploration to both local and foreign 
investors. A total of 15 prospective areas were
identified and offered to interested and qualified
petroleum exploration companies. 
Exploration and Production 
Under SC 38, an additional 150 billion cubic feet
(BCF) of gas has been recovered from the seventh 
(7th) well of the Malampaya, which could fuel a 
300-MW natural gas power plant for a period 
of 12 years. The SC-38 under Shell Philippines 
Exploration (SPEX) B.V. likewise drilled the 
Camago-2 appraisal well in offshore NW Palawan 
with a total depth of 4,111 meters in water depth 
of 709 meters. The purpose is to determine the 
connectivity of the Camago and Malampaya 
structures.
On the other hand,the SC 56 operator,Exxon Mobil
Exploration and Production Philippines (EMEPP) 
over the Sulu Sea basin drilled Banduria-1 well 
in 2010 with a total depth of 4,370 meters. The 
company likewise drilled Palendag-1 well with a 
total depth of 4,756 meters. EMEPP, the largest
oil and gas explorer, developer and producer in 
the world, started its drilling operations in the 
country in October 2009. In 2011, two (2) wells 
were spudded and drilled by Nido Petroleum 
Philippines Pty. Ltd in offshore Northwest Palawan 
and NorAsian Energy Ltd in Northwest Leyte, 
namely Gindara-1 and Duhat-1/1A, respectively. 
Oil production in the country, which comes 
mostly from the two (2) production wells in Galoc 
Field, reached 2.3 million barrels (MMB) in 2011 
as compared to 3.1 MMB in 2010. The decrease 
in oil production was mainly due to the conduct 
of preventive maintenance in the Shallow Water 
Platform. On the other hand, gas production 
from Malampaya field increased to 140 billion
standard cubic feet (BSCF) in 2011 from 130 
BSCF in 2010. The increase was also reflected
on associated condensate with production of 5.1

demand.	   The 2011	  World	  Energy	  Outlook	  of	  the	  International	  Energy	  Agency	  (IEA)	  shows	  that	  over	  the	  next	  20
years,	   fossil	   fuels	   will continue	   to	   see	   strong	   growth	   particularly	   in	   the	   electric	   power	   sector. In	   the	   ASEAN	  
region,	  fossil	   fuels	  will	  exhibit	  the	  same	  share	  to	  the	  primary	  energy	  requirements	  by	  2030	  as	  noted	  in	  the	  3rd
ASEAN	  Energy Demand	  Outlook	  (2010).	  	  
Given	   these	   long-­‐term	   energy	   supply	   projection,	   the	   government	   will	   continue	   its	   efforts	   to	   harness	   the
country’s	  indigenous	  oil,	  gas	  and	  coal	  resources to	  ensure greater	  energy	  supply	  security.	  	  	  	  
A. OIL	  AND	  GAS
In	   view	   of	   the	   volatility	   of	   oil	   prices	   in	   the	   world	  
market	   brought	   about	   by	   a	   confluence	   of	   factors,	  
obtaining	   more	   oil	   and	   gas	   resources	   from	  
domestic	   sources	   is	   essential	   in	   reducing	   the	  
country’s	  oil	  import	  bill.	  This	  has	  been	  a	  challenge	  
affecting	   the	   economy and	   as	   such,	   the	  
government	   puts	   premium	   in facilitating
investments	  to	  explore	  new	  sources	  of	  oil	  and	  gas.	  
Performance  Assessment
The	   country	   has	   16 sedimentary	   basins	   with	  
combined	  potential	  of	  4,777	  million	  barrels	  of	  fuel	  
oil	  equivalent	   (MMBFOE) (689.8	  MTOE)	   of	   oil	   and	  
gas	   reserves.	   These	   basins, which	   have	   an	  
aggregate	   area of	   14,000	   square	   kilometers (sq.	  
kms.) as	   shown	   in	   Figure	   36,	   are	   as	   follows:	   (1)	  
Northwest	   Palawan;	   (2)	   Southwest	   Palawan;	   (3)	  
Mindoro-­‐Cuyo;	   (4)	  Recto	   (Reed) Bank;	   (5)	  Visayan;	  
(6)	  Southeast	  Luzon;	  (7)	  Cagayan;	  (8)	  Cotabato;	  (9)

The	   energy	   sector	   has	   aggressively	   pursued	   the	  
exploration	  and	  development	  of indigenous	  oil	  and	  
gas resources through	   the	   conduct	   of	   the	  
Figure 36. SEDIMENTARY BASINS IN THE PHILIPPINESMMB in 2011 from 4.9 MMB in 2010. In the first
half of 2012, oil production already stood at 6.1 
MMB of oil, gas at 72.6 BSCF, and condensate at 
2.5 MMB. In 2011, a total of about 7,458 linekms. of two-dimensional (2D) seismic data were 
acquired in offshore Reed Bank, Northwest and 
Southwest Palawan and onshore Cebu. This is 
in addition to the 1,074.3 line kms. acquired by 
three (3) SC operators in 2010, Gas2Grid Limited 
(SC 44), Pitkin Petroleum Limited (SC 53), and
NorAsian Energy Limited (SC 69). 
Meanwhile, BHP Billiton Petroleum Philippines
(SC 59) and NorAsian Energy Limited (SC 55)
acquired a total of 5,498.7 sq. kms. of threedimensional (3D) seismic data in West Palawan in 
2010. An additional 889.5 sq. kms of 3D seismic
data located in offshore Northwest Palawan, Reed 
Bank and East Visayan Basins were also acquired 
in 2011 from Galoc (SC 14), Forum Ltd. (SC 79) 
and NorAsian Energy Ltd (SC 69). 
Measurable Sectoral Targets
The heightened promotion of these indigenous 
resources through the PECR is expected to yield a 
total of 66 SCs to be awarded during the planning 
horizon (Table 5). The DOE is also gearing up for
the drilling of a total of 95 wells until 2030 or a
target of up to 25 wells every five years starting
2016. 
Production targets for the oil and gas fields are
expected to yield about 78.0 MMB of oil, 3.3 TCF 
of gas and 70.8 MMB of condensate. Malampaya is 
still expected to produce the biggest contribution 
with 23.1 MMB of oil, 2.0 TCF of gas and 62.6 MMB 
of condensate. Additional gas production from 
Sampaguita gas field is anticipated to generate a
total of 1.2 TCF starting 2023.
On the other hand, the DOE aims to acquire new 
geophysical data that will cover 32,500 line kms.
and 3,600 sq. kms. of 2D and 3D seismic data, 
respectively, until 2030. 
Development Challenges
Following are the challenges in the upstream oil 
and gas sector:
• Need for a continuing IEC campaign that will 
educate the public on the importance and 
long-term benefits of petroleum exploration
and development projects, which is beneficial
to the country’s economy. 
• Need to establish national environmental 
standards for petroleum operations 
that will be compliant to international 
benchmarks. 
• Need for more extensive study and 
evaluation of the available geological, 
geophysical and engineering data 
to improve the prospectivity of 
the country’s sedimentary basins. 
Service contractors will also be 
encouraged to acquire, process, 
and interpret geophysical data 
for a better understanding of the 
country’s unexplored sedimentary 
basins. The dwindling worldwide 
petroleum reserves necessitate the 
conduct of petroleum exploration 
into deepwater and frontier areas all 
over the world and in the country.

Plans and Programs
In potential areas for petroleum exploration and 
development, the DOE will closely coordinate with 
concerned government agencies and undertake 
consultations with the local communities to ensure 
public support and acceptability of the projects. 
The DOE will work with Department of 
Environment and Natural Resources (DENR)-
Environmental Management Bureau (EMB) to 
establish the national environmental standards 
for petroleum exploration that will be consistent 
with internationally-accepted standards. 
Under the PECR, the awarding of exploration 
Service Contracts will be done in a transparent 
and timely manner. 
To improve the prospectivity of underexplored 
sedimentary basins of the country, the following 
actions will be undertaken: 
• Upgrade the quality of information and 
data relative to petroleum exploration such 
as geological, geophysical (seismic) and 
engineering data; 
• Encourage international service companies 
to acquire geophysical/seismic data of 
the country’s underexplored sedimentary 
basins through the conduct of multi-client 
surveys. Such vital information and data can 
serve as reference to guide the international 
petroleum exploration companies in their 
investment decisions; and,
• Amend Presidential Decree (P.D.) 87 to 
provide additional incentives for exploration 
activities in underexplored basins. P.D. 87 is 
the legal framework governing petroleum 
exploration in the country. 
Also part of the plan for the sector is the 
institutionalization of a “one-stop shop” that will 
not only expedite the acquisition of permits, 
certificates, endorsement, etc., butlikewise assure
the smooth flow of work to meet the submitted
timelines of the contractor. A Memorandum of 
Agreement (MOA) will be pursued with concerned 
agencies to improve the process and devise a 
system of procedures to accelerate documentation 
requirements of potential investors. 
In response to the optimal energy pricing pillar 
of the Energy Reform Agenda (ERA), the DOE 
will explore the development of a framework/ 
methodology in the near term for the pricing of 
indigenous energy like natural gas whose price 
is linked with international price of oil.
B. COAL
Coal will continue to be a major fuel for the 
ASEAN, specifically for power generation. Based
on the 3rd ASEAN Energy Demand Outlook (2011) 
coal share to the region’s power generation mix 
is expected to reach around 40.0 percent in 2030. 
With abundant coal resource, which could 
be tapped for exploration, development and 
utilization, the government targets a 100.0 
percent increase in indigenous coal production 
for the planning horizon. In maximizing the 
potential domestic coal reserves, the DOE will 
strongly collaborate with concerned stakeholders 
to address social acceptability issues on coal use. 
These include health and environmental effects 
that may result during coal mining, preparation, 
combustion, waste storage and transport. The 
DOE will ensure that said related processes 
strictly comply with environmental standards.
Performance Assessment
The government is bent on exploring the 
country’s coal resources to likewise temper 
impacts of soaring oil prices.
Currently, the Philippines has 13 coal basins with 
total resource potential35 of 2.4 billion metric 
tons (BMT). The largest resource potential is 
in Semirara, Antique with 570 million metric
tons (MMMT), while the smallest is in Quezon 
with 2.0 MMMT. Other coal basins are located 
35 Resource potential is a geological concept quantified based on 
geoscientific and sampling datain Cagayan Valley, Polillo-Batan-Catanduanes, 
Mindoro, Masbate, Samar-Leyte, Cebu, Negros, 
Surigao, Zamboanga, Davao and Cotabato 
Sarangani as shown in Figure 37. 
On the other hand, the country’s in-situ36 coal 
reserves are estimated at 438.8 MMMT.
Indigenous coal production has steadily 
increased to 6.9 MMMT (@ 10,000 BTU/lb) (3.6 
MTOE) in 2011, a 3.5 percent higher from 2010
production of 6.7 MMMT (3.5 MTOE). Such could
be attributed to sustained production output 
of Semirara Mining Corporation, the country’s 
largest open pit mine, which contributed 6.5
MMMT (3.4 MTOE) or 94.0 percent of the total 
coal production. The remaining 6.0 percent came 
from other coal contractors and small-scale coal 
mining permittees. Domestic coal production in 
2011 was the highest ever in the history of local 
coal mining and represented around 47.0 percent 
of the country’s total coal requirement. During 
the first half of 2012, coal production already
stood at 3.7 MMMT.
36 In-situ reserves are the tonnages of in-placed coal contained 
in seams or section of seams for which sufficient information 
(data gathered from drilling) is available to enable detailed or 
conceptual mine planning
On the other hand, coal importation 
in 2011 slightly reduced from 
the previous year’s level of 11.0 
MMMT (@ 10,000 BTU/lb) (5.8
MTOE), exhibiting 0.03 percent 
decrease. Of the total, 98.2 percent 
came from Indonesia, 1.2 percent 
from Australia and 0.6 percent 
from Vietnam. In the same year, 
coal exportation was recorded 
at 2.7 MMMT (1.4 MTOE), 49.8 
percent decrease from 2010 level 
of 4.10 MMMT (2.2 MTOE). China 
is the leading consumer of local 
coal with 98.0 percent of the total 
coal export followed by Thailand 
with 2.0 percent.
Meanwhile, total coal 
consumption in 2011 registered 
at 14.6 MMMT (@ 10,000 BTU/
lb.) (7.7 MTOE) or an increase of 10.0 percent 
from the previous year’s 13.3 MMMT (7.0 MTOE). 
The power generation sector accounted for 74.9 
percent of the total coal consumption followed 
by the cement-manufacturing industry with 21.4 
percent, while 2.4 percent for other industries, 
such as meat processing and canning, and the 
remaining 1.3 percent for non-energy use as 
shown in Figure 38. 
Coal-fired plants’ share to the total power
generation mix increased by 9.8 percent, from 
23,301 GWh (2.0 MTOE) in 2010 to 25,577 GWh
(2.2 MTOE) in 2011. This could be attributed to 
the commissioning of the first two (2) units of
the 246-MW coal-fired power plant in Toledo
City in April (82 MW Unit I) and June 2010 (82 
MW Unit II), respectively. 
PHILIPPINE ENERGY CONTRACTING ROUND
Through the regular conduct of the PECR, which 
started in 2006, the DOE promotes local and foreign 
investment in the exploration37, development 
and production of the country’s indigenous coal 
resources. The 2009 PECR resulted in the awarding 
of two (2) new coal operating contracts (COCs) on 
24 March 2010 to Cedaphil Mining Corporation 
(COC-171) and Core 8 Mining Corporation (COC172) to explore coal resources in the areas of 
Toledo City, Cebu. Similarly, on 14 December 
37 Exploration is the examination, investigation and/or exploration of lands 
supposed to contain coal by detailed surface geologic mapping, core 
drilling, trenching, test pitting and other appropriate means for probing 
the presence of coal deposits and extent thereof
2011, the DOE awarded nine (9) exploration 
contracts in frontier areas located in Albay, Cebu, 
Davao Oriental, Surigao del Sur, Surigao del Norte, 
Zamboanga del Norte and Zamboanga Sibugay. 
These additions have brought the country’s total 
COCs to 60 as of June 2012 (Figure 39).
To strengthen the competitive process in 
indigenous energy development, the DOE 
issued D.C. 2009-04-000438. Consequently, 
another PECR for coal was launched on 01 
December 2011 offering 38 prospective coal 
areas (Figure 40). Specifically, these areas are
located in: a) Luzon: Quezon, Catanduanes, Albay, 
Sorsogon, Masbate, Occidental Mindoro and 
Oriental Mindoro; b) Visayas: Negros Occidental, 
Cebu, Bohol; and c) Mindanao: Agusan del Norte,

Compostela Valley, Davao Oriental, Lanao del Sur, 
Lanao del Norte, South Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, 
Saranggani, Zamboanga del Norte and Zamboanga 
Sibugay. During the opening of bids on 30 March 
2012, the DOE accepted 57 proposals out of the 69
submitted offerings. The proposals were deemed 
to have complied with the required financial and
technical documentation. The DOE is set to award 
the new set of COCs by the first quarter of 2013.
On the other hand, in terms of small-scale coal 
areas, 25 SSCMPs were issued in 2010 in the
areas of Albay, Cebu, Negros Occidental and 
Zamboanga Sibugay and another 19 SSCMPs 
in 2011 for areas located in Cebu, Zamboanga 
Sibugay, Surigao and Samar. Moreover, during the 
first semester of 2012, 21 SSCMPs were issued in
Zamboanga Sibugay, two (2) in Surigao del Sur 
and one (1) in Albay bringing the total number of 
SSCMPs to 100 as of June 2012. 
Meanwhile, existing COC holders for exploration 
have been conducting geological mapping, 
boundary and topographic surveys, and subsurface investigations such as trenching 
and test pitting in various coalfields in the
country. Likewise, diamond drilling39 is being 
undertaken in the coal areas of Sultan KudaratSouth Cotabato-Saranggani, Cebu, Catanduanes 
and Batan Island for detailed evaluation and 
assessment of potential coal resources. 
POLICY INITIATIVES
To address illegal coal mining and trading 
activities in various parts of the country, the 
DOE issued DC No. 2012-05-000640 which 
mandates that no person or entity is allowed 
to trade or utilize coal unless duly accredited 
or registered with DOE. The Circular aims to 
prevent the proliferation of illegal coal mining 
and trading activities, irresponsible coal 
handling, stockpiling, and transporting resulting 
in environmental impacts and substantial loss 
of government revenues from unreported coal 
sales.
ALTERNATIVE USES OF COAL 
The DOE implements coal development 
projects to address the social acceptability and 
environmental issues on the use of coal. The 
Coalbed Methane (CBM)41 Resource of Selected 
Philippine Coalfields: A New Alternative Clean
Burning Fossil Fuel Project aims to provide an 
inventory of CBM resources in the country in 
view of the demand for cleaner and alternative 
indigenous fuel. The project will also update 
resource estimates of coalfields to fully assess the
CBM resource potential in the country. As part of 
the project, activities, such as diamond drilling 
and gas sampling, were conducted in Zamboanga 
coalfield, followed by similar activities in Batan
Island, Cebu and Semirara Island in 2010. 
Analyses of the gas content, gas storage capacity 
and coal quality indicated that the Malangas 
coalfield in Zamboanga exhibits high potential
for CBM. The CBM project will have its final
evaluation completed by end of 2012. This 
39 Diamond Drilling is a method of drilling to explore coal and 
minerals using a drill machine with a diamond bit.
40 DC No. 2012-05-0006 Guidelines on the Accreditation of Coal 
Traders and Registration of Coal End-Users
41 Process by which methane gas is extracted from coal bed using 
drill holes that siphon or drain the gas that can be used for power 
generation and other energy applications
could be the basis of the development and 
utilization of CBM resources in the country. 
Measurable Sectoral Targets
As in other indigenous energy resources, 
the government will promote the entry 
of private sector participation in the coal 
industry to attain the 100 percent target 
increase in indigenous coal production, and 
consequently reduce coal importation. The 
country has been importing an average of 
71.0 percent of its coal requirements for 
the last 20 years. Local coal production 
could further increase with the conversion 
of currently issued COCs for exploration 
to development and production stage. To 
ensure timely completion of the contract 
commitments and facilitate the conversion, 
the DOE will strictly monitor the work 
program of project proponents. Likewise, 
with due diligence and in coordination with 
concerned government agencies, such as 
DENR and local government units (LGUs), 
small-scale coal mining permits will still be issued 
during the planning period. The COC holders, 
including those awarded with SSCMPs, must 
conform with environmental concerns relating to 
mining activities as stipulated in their respective 
Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC). A
complementary initiative is to improve the quality 
of local coal, which will be a continuing effort 
between the government and industry players. 
By 2030, in-situ reserves will reach 510.0 MMMT.
Around 44.9 percent of these reserves are found 
in Mindanao (specifically Region XII). Meanwhile,
about 44.7 percent will be sourced from the 
Visayas, and the remaining from North Luzon. In 
the near term, coal production (@ 10,000 BTU/lb) 
is expected to reach 8.33 MMMT by 2012 with an 
uptick target of 12.59 MMMT by 2020. At the end
of the planning period, this is projected to reach its 
100 percent target with an estimated production 
of 13.3 MMMT (@10,000 BTU/lb). Bulk of the 
production will come from the large-scale coal 
mines in the Visayas, specifically in Region VI, and
the small-scale coal mines in the Mindanao region. 
The target production will likewise fuel the 
246-MW Toledo Expansion Project in Barangay 
Daanlungsod, Toledo City, Cebu (Table 6). 
On the other hand, six (6) mine-mouth power 
projects with total potential generation capacity 
of 500.0 MW are open for investments. These
are located in the areas of Isabela, Cagayan, 
Sultan Kudarat, South Cotabato and Surigao.
Development Challenges
• Need for a continuing multi-stakeholder 
dialogue and IEC to address environmental 
and social acceptability issues related to 
coal mining and utilization projects. The IEC 
campaign also aims to enlist the support of 
host communities to coal projects. 
• Need to develop a program that would 
harness and improve the quality of the 
country’s vast low-rank coal to create 
higher demand for such and reduce coal 
importation. There is also a need to intensify 
studies on other alternative uses of local 
coal to promote its utilization.

Figure 40. COAL AREAS FOR OFFER• Need to develop a framework/methodology 
for the pricing of indigenous energy. The 
upstream coal sector recognizes the need to 
establish a benchmark for local coal pricing. 
• Need to review tax issues affecting energy 
prices. Attendant to the exploration and 
development of indigenous energy resources 
are various local taxes that make the cost of 
producing and utilizing local energy expensive.
Plans and Programs 
Within the planning horizon, the DOE in 
collaboration with the private sector, will 
undertake the following initiatives to increase 
production and meet domestic requirements for 
coal in power generation and industries:
• Formulate and implement, in the immediate 
term, policy reforms on the following: (a) 
Revised Coal Mine Safety and Regulation; (b) 
Revised Small-scale Coal Mining Guidelines; 
(c) Guidelines on coal trader’s accreditation 
and coal transport permit; and (d) CBM. 
• Continue the regular conduct of PECR to offer 
prospective coal areas for exploration and 
development covering the country’s 13 coal 
basins and those to be determined as new 
potential sites. 
• Pursue R&D activities to improve existing 
technologies for pollution control in the 
use of coal, particularly in coal-fired power
plants. As a corollary effort, the DOE will 
institutionalize the application of clean coal 
technologies such as fluidized bed combustion, 
flue gas desulfurization and electrostatic 
precipitation to address concerns on 
marketability and environmental issues. 
• Promote adoption of local coal quality 
upgrading technologies such as coal 
washing42/preparation and blending. As a
42 Wet method of cleaning low-rank coal by separating coal from 
the wastes using the specific gravity differences. This method 
reduces ash and sulfur contents of coal and increases its heating 
value
parallel initiative, the DOE will formulate and 
implement a policy on the use of indigenous 
low-rank coal including a corresponding 
program to enhance its quality and 
compliance with environmental standards.
• Undertake studies on environmentfriendly alternative uses of coal such as coal 
liquefaction43, coal gasification44 and CBM 
technology. 
• With the improvement of local coal quality and 
adoption of clean coal technologies, the DOE 
will continue to work on the development of 
a sustainable market for the industry to make 
local coal competitive with imported coal 
from Indonesia, China, Vietnam and other 
coal exporting countries. 
• Similar with natural gas resource, a 
framework/methodology for pricing of local 
coal resource will be developed to maximize 
the benefits that will accrue to government in 
terms of collecting appropriate government 
royalties, determination of the true cost of 
production, and the formulation of realistic 
price projections.
• Harmonize national and local taxes imposed
on energy development activities.
• Continue international undertakings such as 
participation in the ASEAN Forum on Coal 
(AFOC) to advance domestic initiatives on the 
promotion of clean coal technology (CCT), 
enhancement of low quality coal, building up 
of coal image to promote social acceptability, 
and determining the applicability of other 
potential technologies like carbon capture and 
storage. The development of ASEAN regional 
policy on coal trade would likewise facilitate 
supply arrangements among member states.

Renewable Energy
The concern on energy supply security, volatility 
of oil prices, as well as the adverse effects of energy 
uses to the environment are primary reasons why 
there is a need to strengthen the development 
and utilization of RE sources. The passage of the 
RE Law of 2008 and the adoption of the NREP 
for 2012-2030 are among the government’s 
response to these growing concerns. The NREP 
was formulated and officially launched on 14 June
2011. It contains the renewed commitment of 
the government to promote utilization of RE and 
aspiration to increase its contribution to power 
generation from its 2010 level and harness its 
potential for non-power application. Specifically,
the NREP objectives are as follows:
• Increase the utilization of indigenous RE 
resources to help ensure the country’s 
energy security and independence as well 
as minimize the adverse impact of modern 
energy use;
• Institutionalize a comprehensive approach 
to address the challenges and gaps hindering 
the wider application of RE technologies in a 
sustainable manner;
• Assist the stakeholders including donor 
institutions to maximize market penetration 
of RE resources in the energy sector; and, 
• Outline the action plan necessary to facilitate 
and encourage greater participation of 
private sector.
Underpinning the NREP are the policy 
mechanisms under the RE Law of 2008. 
The DOE and other concerned government 
institutions are mandated to formulate the 
policy mechanisms to fully implement the RE 
Law that include the following: 
• Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS)
• Feed-in Tariff (FiT)
• Green Energy Option Program
• Net-Metering for Renewable Energy
In the finalization stage is the set of rules on
Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) which 
sets the minimum percentage of generation 
from eligible RE resources, provided by the 
generators, distribution utilities and electric 
suppliers. Initially, an installation target of 760 
MW from RE is set for the first three (3) years
from 2013 to 2015 broken down as follows:
1)	 250 MW - biomass
2)	 250 MW - run-of-river hydro
3)	 50 MW - solar
4) 200 MW - wind
5)	 10 MW - ocean
On the other hand, the FiT provides guaranteed 
payments on a fixed rate per kWh for RE
generation excluding generation for own 
use. On 27 July 2012, the Energy Regulatory 
Commission (ERC) approved the initial Feed-in 
Tariffs (FITs) rates (Table 7) which will apply to 
generation from renewable energy (RE) sources, 
particularly, run-of-river hydro, biomass, wind, 
and solar. There is no FiT rate initially approved 
for Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) 
resource as further study and more data analysis 
must be first undertaken.
Table 7. ERC-APPROVED FIT RATES
Resource FiT Rate (PhP/kWh)
Hydropower 5.90
Biomass 6.63
Wind 8.53
Solar 9.68
The approved FiTs shall be subject to review and 
readjustment by the ERC after three (3) years of 
initial implementation or when the installation 
targets for each technology as set by the DOE 
have been met.
Meanwhile, the total installed capacity from 
RE as of 2011 stood at 5,486.8 MW with a
slight increase of 0.88 percent from 2010 
level (Table 8). Hydropower contributed the
biggest share with 3,491.0 MW followed by 
geothermal with 1,847.7 MW installed capacity. 
The decommissioning of the Northern Negros 
Geothermal Plant (NNGP) and the Bac-Man Geothermal Plant (BMGP) Unit 2 (Botong) 
contributed to the decrease of geothermal total 
installed capacity of about 6.0 percent from its 
2010 level. Grid-connected biomass installed 
capacity reached 82.8 MW in 2011. However,
there are other existing plants for self-generation 
and possible grid connection installed and 
operating in 2011 with a total capacity of 31.4 
MW. This brings the total installed capacity 
from biomass to 114.2 MW (grid and ownuse). Meanwhile, solar power installed capacity 
remained at one 1.0 MW. 
As of first semester 2012, there are 215 RE
service contracts and registration certificates
awarded broken down as follows: (i) hydropower 
with 109; (ii) geothermal with 26; (iii) Wind 
with 22; (iv) biomass with 39; (v) solar with 18, 
and (vi) ocean with one (1) (Table 9). These RE 
contracts and registration certificates awarded
had an aggregate estimated capacity of 5,848.8
MW. To date, these projects are under different 
stages of development. The target dates of 
commercial operation are expected to sustain or 
even increase the contribution of RE to power 
generation mix. 
Table 10 summarizes the target of the government 
on renewable energy over the planning period. 
The total target capacity is estimated at 9,525
MW from committed and indicative projects, 
including potential resources.

Geothermal plant in Tongonan, Leytecontract with the National Power Corporation 
(NPC). From its inception in 1979, 132 wells have 
been drilled. Cumulative electricity generated 
from the Makban Geothermal Power Plant from 
1979 to 2011 stood at 68,646 GWh, while a total 
of 1,177 GWh was already produced during 
the first half of 2012. The MakBan Geothermal
Complex (power plants) is now operated by 
AP Renewables, Inc. following its successful 
privatization in August 2008.
Tiwi, Albay. Tiwi in the Albay province is the 
third largest geothermal facility in the country 
which started commercial operation in 1979. 
From the 158 wells drilled in the area, Tiwi
already produced a total of 47,971 GWh of 
electricity as of end-2011, while 588 GWh of
electricity was generated during the first half of
2012. As in Makban, Chevron likewise operates 
the steam field under a contract with NPC until
its privatization in August 2008. AP Renewables 
Inc. now owns the Tiwi Geothermal Complex.
Palinpinon, Negros Oriental. The Southern 
Negros geothermal production field sources
its steam from Puhagan, Balas-balas, Nasuji 
and Sogongon sectors to supply the steam 
requirements of Palinpinon I and II power plants. 
These power plants were formerly operated 
by NPC and currently owned by Greencore 
Geothermal Inc.47 Since its operation in 1980, 
82 wells have been drilled which has produced 
27,142 GWh of electricity as of end 2011, and 
for the first half of 2012, it generated a total of
1,174 GWh. The power produced is supplied to 
the Visayas grid. 
47 The Palinpinon power plants were privatized in October 
2009 with Greencore Geothermal Inc. as the winning 
bidder
Bacman, Sorsogon. The geothermal field
servicing Bacman I - II and Manito Lowland 
power plants harnesses its steam from Palayan, 
Cawayan and Botong sectors of Albay and 
Sorsogon provinces. These power plants are now 
owned and operated by Bacman Geothermal Inc. 
Since its initial production in 1993, the number 
of wells drilled has reached 60. Total electricity 
generation from these power plants for the 
period 1993 to 2011 stood at 7,176 MW which 
is funneled into the Luzon grid. For the first
half of 2012, 118 GWh of electricity was already 
produced.
Mindanao, North Cotabato. The geothermal 
production field provides the steam requirement
for the Mindanao I and II power plants. A total 
of 33 wells were drilled since the time of its 
operation in 1997. EDC developed the steam 
field and operated the power plant since the
expiration of the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) 
contract between EDC and Marubeni Energy 
Services Corp. in July 2009. Electricity generated 
for the Mindanao grid from 1997 to 2011 
reached 11,287 GWh. As of first half of 2012,
electricity generated was recorded at 560 GWh.
Northern Negros.The49.4-MWgeothermalfield
located near Mt. Kanlaon in Negros Occidental 
started its commercial operation in February 
2007. The field was developed and operated by
EDC. The buyer of electricity is Iloilo Electric 
Cooperative (ILECO). From 2007 to 2011, about 
241 GWh of electricity was generated from 18 
wells that were drilled in the area. 
Performance Assessment
Among the renewable energy sources, 
geothermal energy provided the biggest 
contribution in the 2011 total primary energy 
accounting for 21.7 percent, as shown in 
Figure 42. 
Geothermal power plants contributed 11.4 
percent to the total installed generating capacity 
of 16,226.9 MW in the same year. However, in
2011, the Northern Negros Geothermal Project 
was decommissioned with the completion of 
the testing of geothermal wells in the Pataan 
production sector. Similarly, the critical 
equipment from the 20-MW Botong power plant 
(Bacman II Unit 2) will be moved and utilized as 
replacement for Cawayan power plant (Bacman 
II Unit 1). The Botong power plant based 
on the independent geohazard studies has 
indicated high risk of landslides. Likewise, Unit 
3 of the 55-MW Tiwi geothermal power plant
has undergone deactivated shutdown since 
December 2006. These developments have 
brought the country’s total installed capacity to 
1,847.7 MW as of December 2011.
Despite the decline in generating capacity from 
geothermal power plants, gross electricity 
generated from geothermal increased by 0.13 
percent from 9,929 GWh (8.6 MTOE) in 2010 
to 9,942 GWh (8.6 MTOE) in 2011. The slight 
increase in generation was attributed to the 
synchronization to the grid of Unit 1 of Bacman 
geothermal plant in December 2011 after 
undergoing rehabilitation in 2009. With the 
aggregate generation from geothermal in 2011, 
a total of 17.1 MMBFOE was displaced. This 
could be translated to foreign exchange savings 
of around US$ 1.88 billion based on the average 
crude price of US$ 109.9 per barrel during that 
year (2011). 
During the first half of 2012, power generation
from geothermal already reached 5,261 GWh,
contributing about 14.6 percent share to the 
total generation mix.

Performance  Assessment
Among	   the	   renewable	   energy sources,	  
geothermal	   energy	   provided	   the	   biggest	  
contribution	   in	   the	   2011 total	   primary	   energy	  
accounting	  for	  21.7 percent,	  as	  shown	  in	  Figure
42.
Geothermal	   power	   plants	   contributed	   11.4
percent	   to	   the	   total	   installed	   generating	  
capacity	   of	   16,226.9 MW in	   the	   same	   year.	  
However, in 2011, the	   Northern	   Negros	  
generated	   from	   geothermal	   	   increased	   by	   0.13	  
percent	  from	  9,929 GWh (8.6 MTOE) in	  2010 to	  
9,942 GWh (8.6 MTOE) in	   2011.	   The	   slight	  
increase	   in generation	   was	   attributed	   to	   the	  
synchronization	  to	  the	  grid	  of	  Unit	  1	  of	  Bacman	  
geothermal	   plant	   in	   December	   2011	   after
undergoing rehabilitation	   in	   2009. With	   the	  
aggregate generation from	  geothermal	  in	  2011,	  
a	   total	   of	   17.1 MMBFOE	   was displaced.	   	   This	  
could	  be	  translated	  to	  foreign	  exchange	  savings

Camarines Sur, Sorsogon, Biliran and Surigao 
del Norte. Commissioning of these projects 
is expected to contribute a total of 785 MW 
potential capacity additions for the entire grid.
Another major milestone in the geothermal 
industry was the signing of five (5) GSCs on
9 March 2012 for the pre-development of 
areas in Misamis Oriental, Misamis Occidental, 
Zamboanga del Sur, Negros Occidental and North 
Cotabato with total potential capacity of 130 MW. 
Likewise, three (3) new geothermal operating 
contracts (GOCs) were awarded on 8 May 2012 
for the operation of Palinpinon Geothermal 
Power Plant, Tongonan Geothermal Power Plant 
and Bacman Geothermal Power Plant. 
Measurable Sectoral Targets
The implementation of RE Act and the regular 
conduct of OCSP is expected to spur investments 
in geothermal energy production.
Aiming to outrank the country’s current global 
standing in geothermal energy production, the 
government targets the installation of additional 
1,455 MW geothermal capacity to contribute
to the goal of tripling the share of renewable 
energy for power generation by 2030. Three 
of these potential capacity additions are already 
classified as committed projects – the 20-MW
Maibarara Geothermal Power Project in Laguna, 
the 20-MW Nasulo Geothermal Power Project 
in Palinpinon, Negros Oriental, and the 50-
MW Mindanao III Geothermal Project in North 
Cotabato – which are expected to come on stream 
between 2013 and 2014. The commissioning 
of the said projects represents 6.2 percent 
of the total potential capacity additions from 
geothermal available in the country. In terms of 
indicative projects, a total of 200 MW is expected 
to be commissioned starting 2015 (Table 11).
To further realize the target of increasing the 
contribution of renewable energy-based capacity 
to power generation, 26 geothermal projects with 
total estimated capacity of 1,165 MW (Table 12)
will be made available for potential investments 
within the planning period. A total of 680 MW 
is envisioned to come from Luzon, 195 MW from
Visayas, and 290 MW from Mindanao.
On the other hand, starting 2012, around 172 
wells are to be drilled for the next 20 years (Table 
13). With the privatization of the PNOC- EDC (now 
known as EDC), the private sector will take the 
lead in the pursuit of developing new geothermal 
areas, as well as expansion and optimization of 
existing steam fields. By 2030, total geothermal
installed capacity will reach 1,808.9 MW, which 
could generate 14,021 GWh of electricity. This will 
correspond to an equivalent fuel oil displacement 
of 3.4 MTOE by the end of the planning period. 
Development Challenges
• There is a need to harmonize provisions of 
R.A.7586or theNationalIntegratedProtected
Areas System (NIPAS) of 199251 and R.A. 
8371, otherwise known as Indigenous 
People’s Rights Act (IPRA)52 of 1997, with 
51 NIPAS is the classification and administration of all designated 
protected areas to maintain essential ecological processes and 
life-support systems, to preserve genetic diversity, to ensure 
sustainable use of resources found therein and to maintain their 
natural conditions to the greatest extent possible.
52 Section 7.a. of IPRA states the right to negotiate the terms and 
conditions for the exploration of natural resources in the areas 
for the purpose of ensuring ecological, environmental protection 
and the conservation measures, pursuant to national and 
customary laws

• Optimization of geothermal
utilization through 
the cascading use and 
development of low 
enthalpy system. 
• Development of technology 
that can tap acidic or young 
geothermal systems. The 
exploration and development 
of various promising areas 
have been temporarily 
deferred pending the onset of 
technological breakthroughs 
in handling acidic wells.
• Need to institute policies 
that would manage energy 
price risks, specifically price
of geothermal steam which 
is currently benchmarked 
with the international price 
of coal. 
Plans and Programs
Energy diversification
will be a continuing 
priority of the 
government to boost the 
country’s energy supply 
and meet the growing 
domestic requirements 
for energy. To attain this 
development goal, the 
DOE shall continue to 
actively promote the use 
of geothermal resources 
through the OCSP. Continued exploration in 
identifiedprospectiveareas–bothunderexplored
and unexplored – specifically in the area of Mt.
Balatukan in Balingasag, Misamis Occidental will 
be aggressively pursued for the next 20 years. 
Meanwhile, the current service contractors will 
be encouraged to undertake expansion and full 
utilization or optimization of their respective 
projects during the planning horizon. The service contractors in the areas of Rangas and 
Tanawon in Bacman as well as Nasulo and Dauin 
in Palinpinon are set to undertake exploration of 
geothermal reservoir to increase the potential 
capacity of these steam fields. 
On the other hand, under the “Detailed Resource 
Assessment of Low-Enthalpy Geothermal Resources 
in the Philippines” Project, the activities to be carried 
out include detailed geo-scientific investigations
covering geophysical survey, geological mapping, 
geochemical survey, socio-economic, and 
environmental baseline studies particularly in the 
areas of Balut Island in Davao del Sur, Banton Island 
in Romblon and Maricaban Island in Batangas. 
Aside from large-scale geothermal development, 
the government is also taking initiatives to 
develop non-power geothermal applications. The 
conduct of various studies in collaboration with 
concerned agencies, as well as the formulation of 
guidelines for non-power use, are only some of 
the programs being considered. 
To address environmental and socio-cultural 
issues arising from the implementation of 
energy projects, closer coordination efforts 
with concerned agencies such as the DENR, 
National Commission on Indigenous People 
(NCIP), and Local Government Units (LGUs), 
among others, and host communities will have 
to be strengthened. IEC campaign also needs to 
be intensified to increase level of awareness of
stakeholders on the nature of the project. The joint 
DENR-DOE Technical Working Group (TWG) and 
Secretariat created by virtue of Joint DENR-DOE 
Special Order Nos. 2011-12-0001 and 2012-12-
0001, were issued in 2011 and 2012, respectively. 
Among the functions and responsibilities of the 
TWG is to harmonize policies and guidelines on 
the exploration, development, utilization, and 
conservation of natural resources for energy 
projects especially in protected areas. 
With the same issue on high energy price of 
indigenous energy resources, the development 
of a framework/methodology for the pricing of 
geothermal resource is also seen necessary. Such 
initiative would determine true cost of steam 
production, as well as to facilitate formulation of 
realistic price projections. 
B. HYDROPOWER
Performance Assessment
The passage of RE Act boosted the development 
of hydro resources in the country and increased 
the contribution of renewable energy to the total 
energy requirement. 
The total installed capacity of hydropower in 
2011 was recorded at 3,490.7 MW, while total 
power generation during the same year was 
9,698 GWh. The increase in installed capacity 
from 2010 level (3,400 MW) was attributed to 
recent developments in the sector particularly 
to the uprating of San Roque and Buhi-Barit 
hydro plants. After turning over these plants to 
their GenCo successors, the contract rating of 
345 MW of San Roque and 1.8 MW of Buhi-Barit
hydro plants were adjusted to their nameplate 
ratings of 411 MW and 2.0 MW, respectively, 
thereby increasing the total capacity of hydro 
by 66.2 MW. Other contributory factor was the 
rehabilitation conducted by successor GenCos 
of Ambuklao, Magat and Binga Hydro Electric
Plants yielding total increase in nameplate 
ratings of 215 MW.
On the other hand, during the first half of 2012,
power grid generation from hydro resources 
already stood at 4,481 GWh contributing about 
12.4 percent share to the total generation mix.
Further, 109 Hydro Service Contracts (HSCs)
have been awarded for exploration and 
development with equivalent potential capacity 
of 2,247.8 MW. Of this, 37 HSCs were awarded in
2012 with total capacity of 899.5 MW.
Measurable Sectoral Targets
The overall thrust for hydro is to develop smalland large-scale hydropower capacities and 
explore further on ocean technology. During 
the planning period, the target is to achieve an 
additional 4,961 MW of installed capacity from 
hydropower. This is equivalent to 142.0 percent 
increase from the 2011 installed capacity. The 
target installed capacity will be coming from 
26.1 MW committed and 182 MW indicative 
projects, and 4,752.9 MW potential resources.
Table 14 provides the list of hydro capacity 
additions from committed and indicative hydro 
projects totaling to 208.1 MW. Committed 
projects having a total of 26.1 MW include both 
grid and off-grid connections. It is expected that 
by 2014, all committed projects are in place and 
contributing to the energy mix; and by mid of 
the planning period, an aggregate of 182 MW 
of indicative hydro capacities will be available 
for private investments. Upon 
successful installation of the 
208.1 MW total committed and 
indicative capacity additions, 
it is estimated that by 2020 a 
cumulative gross generation of 
11,273 GWh (including existing 
capacity) could be added to the 
generation mix. Such generation 
from hydro could be translated 
into an equivalent 2.7 MTOE of 
fuel oil displacement. 
The potential hydro resources 
as of the first semester of 2012
totaling to about 4,752.9 MW
(Table 15) is expected to be
developed during the planning 
horizon. By major islands, Luzon 
has around 3,089.7 MW potential 
hydro resources, while Visayas and Mindanao 
have potential hydro resources of 250.7 MW and
1,412.5 MW, respectively.
CAR has the biggest hydro potential with a total 
estimated capacity of 1,355 MW attributed to the
mix of small and large potential sites, to include 
the 600-MW Apayao-Abulog. Region III has 
also huge potential hydropower resource due 
to Angat and Pantabangan hydro. It has a total 
potential resource of 784.9 MW. It is interesting 
to note that hydro may be contributing to the 
power requirement of the NCR. By 2015-2016,
hydropower development is expected with 
potential resource of 12.1 MW coming from the 
rivers of Marikina, Pasig and San Juan. 
 
Visayas may not be bountiful in hydro resources 
similar to geothermal and biomass, yet an 
estimated 250.7 MW hydro potential is present
in this region. 
With hydro as its major source of power, 
Mindanao is gifted with about 1,412.5 MW of
this resource potential distributed all over the 
region. Of the total potential, 904.8 MW could 
be found in Region X, 114.1 MW in Region XI, 
and 285 MW in Region XII.

uprating of	  San	  Roque	  and	  Buhi-­‐Barit	  hydro	  plants.	  
After	   turning	   over	   these plants	   to their GenCo	  
successors,	  the	  contract	   rating	  of	  345	  MW	  of San	  
Roque	   and	   1.8	   MW	   of Buhi-­‐Barit	   hydro	   plants	  
were adjusted	   to	   their	   nameplate	   ratings of	   411	  
MW	  and	  2.0	  MW,	  respectively, thereby increasing	  
the	   total	   capacity	   of	   hydro	   by	   66.2	   MW.	   Other	  
contributory	   factor	   was the	   rehabilitation	  
conducted	   by	   successor	   GenCos of	   Ambuklao,	  
Magat	   and	   Binga	   Hydro	   Electric	   Plants yielding	  
total	  increase	  in	  nameplate	  ratings	  of	  215	  MW.
On	   the	   other	   hand,	   during	   the	   first	   half	   of	   2012,	  
power	   grid	   generation	   from	   hydro	   resources	  
already	   stood	   at	   4,481	   GWh	   contributing	   about	  
12.4	   percent	   share	   to	   the	   total	  
generation	  mix.
Further,	   109	   Hydro	   Service	  
Contracts	   (HSCs)	   have	   been	  
awarded	   for	   exploration	   and	  
development	   with	   equivalent	  
potential	   capacity	   of	   2,247.8	  
MW.	   Of	   this,	   37	   HSCs	   were	  
awarded	   in	   2012	   with	   total	  
capacity	  of	  899.5	  MW.
Measurable  Sectoral  Targets
The	   overall	   thrust	   for	   hydro	   is	  
to	   develop	   small-­‐ and	   large-­‐
scale hydropower capacities	  
and	   explore	   further	   on	   ocean	  
technology. During	  the	  planning	  period,	  the	  target	  
is	   to	  achieve an	  additional	  4,961 MW	  of installed	  
capacity from	   hydropower.	   This	   is	   equivalent	   to	  
142.0 percent	   increase from the	   2011	   installed	  
capacity.	   The	   target	   installed	   capacity	   will	   be
coming	   from	   26.1	   MW	   committed	   and	   182 MW	  
indicative	   projects,	   and	   4,752.9 MW	   potential	  
resources.	  
Table	   14 provides	   the	   list	   of	   hydro	   capacity	  
additions	   from	   committed	   and	   indicative	   hydro

Note: Hydro committed projects are subject to FiT eligibilityAs mandated in Section 6 of the RE Act and Sec. 
4 Rule 2 of its IRR, all stakeholders are obliged 
to contribute to the growth of the RE industry. 
The same rule also mandates the DOE to set the 
annual minimum RPS requirements from eligible 
RE sources. Related to this, hydropower resources 
listed in Table 15 are potential sources of annualRPS
requirement once these are tapped and developed. 
In remote areas, micro hydro could be utilized 
as stand alone source of power. The micro hydro 
development program of the DOE will prioritize 
the inventory of the resources to optimize their 
uses and study the possibility of interconnection 
via mini-grid systems. The development of RE 
in off-grid and SPUG or missionary areas shall 
be aligned with the Missionary Electrification
Development Plan to ensure compliance with 
the procedures and guidelines set for the QTPs 
or New Power Providers (NPPs).
 
Moreover, a demonstration facility of sea water 
pump storage is targeted by 2030. This ambitious 
target provides the challenge to push more on 
the research, development and deployment 
(RD&D) programs of the government coupled 
with the successful implementation of NREP 
and policy mechanisms of the RE Law. 
Development Challenges
The development of large hydropower plants 
is capital intensive with an estimated cost of 
PhP105 million per MW of installed capacity.
Other attendant challenges are as follows: 
· Government needs to put in place policy 
interventions that will bring profitable
return of investment from large hydropower 
development which has a longer gestation 
period.
·	 Hydro resources are located in
underdeveloped or undeveloped areas 
which may require construction of roads.
· Present technologies on hydropower being 
applied and used on river systems may 
need augmentation and requires future 
development of ocean or sea waters.
Plans and Programs
The following initiatives are targeted in the 
medium- and long-term planning of government 
to address the major challenges deemed as 
barriers to optimal hydro resource development:
· Ensure effective and timely implementation 
of fiscal and non-fiscal incentives provided
under the RE Act;
· Intensify efforts to develop untapped hydro 
resource potential;
· Optimize the mini-hydro-potential in 
validated sites;
· Provide technology/technical support to 
boost local manufacturing capability;
· Establish standards and best practices and 
technology mentoring;
· Establish and operate hydro research 
center; and, 
· Develop and install demonstration facility of 
sea water pump storage.

Performance Assessment 
The government’s program to develop biomass 
energy resources resulted in the substantial 
increase in its capacity. The total installed 
capacity of biomass facilities in 2010 reached to 
about 39 MW, while on-grid and self-generation 
installations as of 2011 stood at 114.2 MW. Table 
16 shows the grid connected biomass facilities 
totaling to about 83.0 MW installed and 46.0 
MW dependable capacities, respectively. Crystal 
Sugar has started exporting power to the grid in 
February 2012, while Laguna Land Fill Gas and 
Casa Bioenergy have started exporting power 
to the grid in March 2011. These generation 
facilities provided capacity additions to the 
Luzon Grid by 17.5 MW, Visayas Grid by 44.3
MW and Mindanao by 21 MW. In 2011, total 
generation from biomass stood at 115.3 GWh,
while generation in the first half of 2012 already
reached 85.3 GWh.
Table 17 summarizes biomass 
registration certificates awarded
by the DOE under the RE Law 
totaling to 39 projects as of 
first semester of 2012. Out of
these certificates issued for
commercial operation, projects 
with total 204.4 MW of biomass 
energy were installed in 2010, 78.6 MW in 2011 
and 0.6 MW during the first semester of 2012 or
a total of 283.5 MW. Of these capacities, biomass
projects with total of 78.8 MW are connected 
and exporting power to the grid. On the other 
hand, biomass projects with total of 31.4 MW 
as enumerated below are generating power 
for own-use while waiting for FiT eligibility to 
connect to the grid: 
·	 12.5-MW Bataan 2020 Inc. in Samal
Bataan;
·	 0.9-MW Hacienda Bio-Energy, Inc. in San
Miguel, Bulacan; and
· 18-MW Victorias Milling Company in 
Victorias City, Negros Occidental.
This brings the total installed capacity to 114.2-
MW from biomass power.

These projects have total capacity of about 27.0 
MW intended for power and direct heating 
applications.
Measurable Sectoral Targets 
To sustain the target growth of biomass in the 
energy mix, it is incumbent upon the government 
to pursue continuing resource development 
coupled with the conduct of research and 
development. Priority programs will address 
gaps that hinder the spur of biomass power 
development and utilization. Likewise, strong 
partnership and collaboration with the private 
sector would remain an essential component in 
the government programs. It is expected that 
Biomass Renewable Energy Operating Contracts 
(BREOCs) and Certificates of Registrations
issued by the DOE on various biomass projects 
would continue to expand the contribution of 
biomass to the country’s primary energy mix 
both for power and non-power applications. 
Until 2015, it is targeted that about 167.5 MW
from biomass committed and indicative projects 
will become commercially operational and are 
expected to export power to the grid. Table 19 
enumerates the list of committed and indicative 
biomass projects intended for grid connection. 
Biomass committed projects with estimated 
installed capacity of 35.2 MW are expected
within short- to medium-term subject to FiT 
eligibility. Indicative projects with total capacity 
of 132.3 MW are likewise expected within shortto medium- term to support a sustained plan of 
expanding the share of biomass to the energy 
mix. With the installation of these committed 
and indicative biomass projects, the estimated 
cumulative gross generation from biomass by 
until 2016 is estimated at 662.4 GWh (includes 
existing capacity). This is equivalent to 0.16 
MTOE of fuel oil displacement. 
On the other hand, potential biomass projects 
are expected to provide an aggregate capacity 
of about 52.4 MW within the planning period
(Table 20). 
Biomass technologies in the country are 
mature and available. To date, the DOE is 
accepting applications for accreditation of 
local manufacturers and fabricators of parts 
and equipment for biomass facility. Currently 
the biomass technology being applied for 
registrations by the proponents are mostly 
direct combustion of agricultural residues or 
bagasse. Other biomass technologies that can 
be tapped are as follows:
·	 Rice Hull Gasification
· Biogas Power Generation
· Bagasse Cogeneration System
· Waste-to-Energy Conversion
· Multi-Fuel Biomass Power Plant
· Waste-to-Energy Project using Catalytic 
Hydrothermal Gasification
·	 Landfill Methane Recovery
Development Challenges
While biomass consumption has been recorded 
highits use for power application remains low

Some of the challenges that the government 
needs to address to be able to maximize the use 
of biomass are as follows: 
· Need to harmonize the DOE related programs 
with agro-forestry policies for an integrated 
use of biomass for other applications.
· Need to upgrade existing transmission 
infrastructure to support additional grid 
connection of biomass power.
· Need for standards and best practices 
sharing for sustainable biomass supply to 
further encourage investments in biomass 
power.

Plans and Programs
Addressing challenges in the development of 
biomass power is not a sole responsibility of the 
DOE, rather a concerted effort of relevant line 
agencies and industry stakeholders. The following 
action plans are deemed important, to wit: 
· Review of existing policies as well as 
establishment of linkage with other 
government agencies to harmonize plans 
and programs;
· Continuing conduct of research and 
development in biomass technology;
· Adopt appropriate Waste-to-Energy 
technology;
· Conduct IEC activities and public 
consultations; and,
· Conduct study to assess biomass utilization 
in the country.
D. WIND
Performance Assessment 
The country is set to maintain its position as the 
number one wind energy producer in Southeast 
Asia. As of mid-2012, there were 22 Wind 
Energy Service Contracts (WESCs) awarded 
by the DOE under the RE Law. The estimated 
installed capacity from these contracts totals to 
1,030 MW. These projects shall be entitled to all 
the financial and non-financial benefits provided
under the governing policy mechanisms and 
regulations of the law upon their successful 
development and commercial operation.
The additional 8-MW Bangui Wind Power 
Project Phase-II in Ilocos Norte brought the total 
existing installed capacity from wind power to 
33 MWIn 2011gross power generation from 
wind power stood at 88.2 GWh, while generation 
in the first half of 2012 already reached 38.7
GWh. 
Measurable Sectoral Targets 
The government program to accelerate wind 
energy development during the planning horizon 
is geared towards mainstreaming wind power 
into grid. However, there are preconditions that
require government interventions to achieve 
its goal of maintaining the lead wind energy 
producer in Southeast Asia. First, there must 
be innovative financial programs available
from both the government and private financial
institutions; and second, there is a need to develop 
infrastructure support for streaming wind power. 
Wind power grid parity is expected by 2025
upon the installation of 2,499.5 MW committed,
indicative and potential wind projects. 
As shown in Table 21, the committed and 
indicative wind power projects have a total 
capacity of 584.5 MW. Of the total, 67.5 MW
is a committed project from Pililia Wind Power, 
which is expected to be available by 2013. On the 
other hand, the development of indicative wind 
projects would provide 517 MW of additional
capacity, most of which is located in Region I. 
Cumulative gross generation from these capacity 
additions by 2016 is equivalent to 1,577.1 GWh
providing 0.4 MTOE of fuel oil displacement. 
The country could also harness the potential 
wind resources during the planning period 
with total estimated capacity of about 1,915.0
MW (Table 22). Most of the wind potentials 
are found in Luzon, which has 1,772 MW for 
possible grid and off-grid connections. The 
resource-dominant provinces in Luzon are 
Ilocos Norte, Pangasinan and Cagayan. In the 
Visayas there is an estimated 143 MW potential 
capacity addition from wind energy. 
Further, the conduct of detailed resource 
assessment has been a continuing activity of the 
DOE to update the country’s inventory of wind 
resource. Related to this, the three (3) wind 
meteorological masts (50 meters height and 8
inches diameter each) installed by the DOE will 
determine the certainty of wind power that 
can be generated in the following wind farm 
sites: i) Malasin, San Jose City, Nueva Ecija; ii) 
Fatima, Pantabangan, Nuevas Ecija; and, iii) East 
Poblacion, Pantabangan, Nueva Ecija. Like any 
other RE resource, the advancement of wind 
energy depends on the continuing conduct of 
RD&D and application of modern technology. 
Along with the lined-up programs and activities, 
government policy and interventions are necessary 
to boost the development and generation of wind 
power. For wind generation, the ERC approved 
FiT rate is Ph8.53 per kWh. However, this does not
apply on generation for own use. 
Development Challenges 
Concerns over the expanded development of 
wind energy involve not only the government 
but also the potential investors. Policy and 
program mechanisms need to be put in place to 
achieve the objective of harnessing the country’s 
natural resources. The following are challenges 
on wind power development:
· High cost of development to include limited
local manufacturers, fabricators and 
suppliers of RE equipment and components.·
Limited options to optimize the development 
of resources due to lack of updated database.
· Need to enhance local technical capability. 
· Limited information and education campaign 
activities on RE to include advocacy on its 
benefits.
·	 Limited information on the financial and
technical access to new and emerging 
technologies.

Performance Assessment 
The DOE in collaboration with the DBP 
implemented the Rural Power Project (RPP) 
with funding support from the World Bank 
and Global Environment Facility (GEF). The 
project promoted the use of sustainable and 
least-cost decentralized electrification solutions
using renewable energy through public-private 
partnerships. As of the end of 2011, there were 
about 20,305 units PV installed under the RPP. It
is broken down to 15,289 solar home systems,
2,302 solar PV-supported public facilities and 
2,714 solar lanterns. In terms of the RPP’s 
contribution to the electrification goals, the
estimated number of households served using 
decentralized systems by the end of the project 
was 19,453. Said figures included both the
current 18,003 HH with solar PV systems and the
1,450HH connections served by mini-grid system
in Rio-Tuba QTP Project. With the inclusion of 
public facilities, the project’s cumulative total 
connections by the end of 2011 is 21,755.53
On the other hand, the DOE conducted Rapid 
Rural Appraisal (RRA) activity under the 
Household Electrification Project (HEP). This
resultedinthe identificationof6,460households
qualified as beneficiaries of photovoltaic solar
home systems installations. 
Meanwhile, the 1-MW power plant in Northern 
Mindanao continued to provide power to the 
consumers of the Cagayan de Oro Electric Power 
and Light Company (CEPALCO) in the region. 
Measurable Sectoral Targets 
An indicative capacity addition of 35 MW is
expected from solar power by 2015. The Darong
Solar Photovoltaic Power Project in Sta. Cruz, 
Davao del Sur was awarded with Solar Energy 
Service Contract (SESC) by the DOE in December 
2011 and already submitted the Declaration 
of Commerciality. With the installation of said 
53 Source “RPP Progress Report 4Q 2011 
capacity addition, cumulative gross generation 
from solar is estimated at 108.6 GWh with 
equivalent 0.03 MTOE of fuel oil displacement. 
Table 23 shows the list of potential solar power 
resources with a total capacity of about 284.1 
MW. The detailed list of potential solar power 
resource appears as Annex H. The large portion 
of potential solar power resource, about 81.0 
percent, is found in Luzon. 
Development Challenges 
The following challenges are deemed barrier to 
the development of solar power:
· Availability of solar energy depends on the 
weather condition as such, solar energy is 
an intermittent source of power.
· Solar power system usually uses PV 
technology, which has high upfront cost.
· Large land area requirement.
· Need for additional RD&D as well as capacity 
building on other technologies such as the 
Concentrating Solar Thermal Power and solar 
thermal cooling/heating technology.
Plans and Programs
The government is optimistic that the following 
measures will address the challenges:
· Conduct continuing RD&D for viable 
solar energy systems to be commercially 
competitive with conventional energy system;
· Conduct of detailed resource assessment 
and establishment of national database for 
solar resource data;
· Implementation of policy mechanisms and
benefits stipulated under the RE Law; and,
· Conduct of IEC to promote awareness on 
the benefits of solar power.
E. OCEAN THERMAL ENERGY 
 CONVERSION (OTEC)
Performance Assessment 
OTEC is an energy technology that uses 
the ocean’s natural thermal gradient to 
drive a power-producing cycle (www.nrel.
gov). Although this technology may not be 
commercially and immediately available as 
the source of energy in the country, still the 
government has taken initial steps for its longterm development and use.
Preliminary study showed that the country 
has a good potential of ocean energy resource. 
However, itwould require a detailed assessment
to determine the potential capacity that could 
be generated from OTEC. To date, there are 
three (3) OTEC pre-development contracts 
covering 36 areas signed and awarded by the 
DOE. The government is optimistic of installing 
and demonstrating ocean facility within the 
planning period.
Measurable Sectoral Targets 
For the planning period, the government has 
identified potential sites for ocean energy 
development. It consists of 910 blocks 
equivalent to 73,710 hectares. Table 24 shows 
the list of potential ocean energy projects with 
total estimated capacity of 70.5 MW. The
detailed list of ocean potential resource is 
shown as Annex I. These long-term projects 
would require exploration studies with support 
from foreign and local stakeholders. Initially, a 
10-MW ocean energy demonstration project in

Development Challenges
OTEC is at an early stage but the government 
has to start somewhere and hurdle the following 
challenges to realize its objectives:
· Need for infrastructure support such as 
transmission line and submarine cable
· Need to engage local and international 
institutions for the development of OTEC
· Need to intensify RD&D on ocean technology
· Need to establish database on ocean energy 
resources
· Need to develop local capabilities 
· Need to conduct IEC campaing activities on 
OTEC
·	 High cost for exploration and development
Plans and Programs 
The following initiatives are seen as take off 
points for ocean energy development:
· Conduct RD&D activities for OTEC;
· Encourage private sector participation 
through effective implementation of the 
RE Law, specifically on the benefits of the
proponents; 
· Pursue capacity development of local 
expertise;
· Inclusion of infrastructure support 
(transmission line and submarine cable) 
in TDP;
· Promote the use and commercialization 
of ocean energy projects, e.g. OTEC, wave, 
marine and tidal; and
· Establish cooperation with local and 
international institutions for the 
development and commercialization of 
ocean technology.

The DOE, by virtue of R.A. 8479 or Downstream 
Oil Industry Deregulation Act of 1998 is 
mandated to ensure adequate, stable supply, and 
fair price of oil products in the country. Being 
largely dependent on imported oil particularly 
for transport sector use, the country is affected 
by any supply disruption and oil price movement. 
Performance Assessment
The downstream oil industry has steadily 
grown with the continuous entry of investors 
in the country. The total industry players as of 
2011 reached 1,186. This resulted in additional 
investments of about PhP 300.00 million 
bringing total capital infusion of PhP 38.05
billion since the start of deregulation (Table 25).
SUPPLY
Inventory. Actual crudes and petroleum 
products as of 2011 was recorded at 13.2 MMB 
or 42-days supply equivalent (34 days for crude 
oil and products in stock and nine (9) days for 
crude in-transit to the country). This was 4.7 
percent lower than the previous year’s level 
of 13.8 MMB. On the other hand, 2011 average 
inventory was reported at 50 days, 39 days in
stock and 11 days in-transit. For the first half of
2012, the average inventory was equivalent to 
49 days, 39 days in stock and 10 days in transit. 
Meanwhile, the shutdown of the First Philippine 
Industrial Corporation’s (FPIC) White Oil 
Pipeline (WOPL) in late October 2010 affected 
the operations of Pilipinas Shell and Chevron. 
Both Shell and Chevron use the FPIC pipeline to 
replenish stocks from their Batangas refinery/
terminal to Pandacan depots. Temporary shortage 
of petroleum products was felt in some gasoline 
stations in Metro Manila and nearby provinces.
The Supreme Court likewise issued a Writ of 
Kalikasan in November 2010, ordering the 
closure of the pipeline because of its potential 
hazard to the environment.
To address and monitor the situation, the 
DOE Command Center was activated to direct 
and coordinate operations, provide advisories 
to media and the general public on oil supply 
status and oversee the implementation of the oil 
industry business continuity plan. 
To help affected oil companies, the DOE 
requested the MMDA to lift the truck ban in 
areas under its jurisdiction in Metro Manila, 
specifically for petroleum tank trucks, to
increase the turnaround of existing fleets
delivering petroleum products.
TheDOE also intensified its monitoring activities
to ensure availability of supply of petroleum 
products by requiring oil companies to submit 
daily inventory reports, as well as the inspection 
of several gasoline stations, particularly in the 
Metro Manila area. 
To date, FPIC continues to conduct remediation 
operations in Barangay Bangkal, West 
Tower rehabilitation, health and community 
engagements, and regularly submits progress 
report to the DOE.
With strong collaboration and the foregoing 
measures adopted by both the oil companies 
and the government, oil supply in Metro Manila 
and nearby provinces has been adequately 
addressed

**Includes 261 independent gas stationsIn cases where domestic and international 
events threaten or restrict the country’s supply 
of petroleum, D.C. 2011-03-0002 was issued 
to ensure continuous supply of petroleum. 
The Circular specifically requires: a) all oil
companies, except refiners, operating in the
country and bulk suppliers to maintain a 
minimum inventory equivalentto 15 days supply
of petroleum products, except LPG which shall 
be maintained at seven (7) days supply; and b) 
refiners shall maintain a minimum inventory
equivalent to 30 days supply consisting of crude 
oil and refined petroleum products.
Meanwhile, to promote efficiency in supply
and distribution chain, Section 9 of the IRR of
R.A. 8479 mandates that the DOE shall 
continue to encourage joint industry 
activities to include: 
• Borrow-and-loan agreements, 
• Rationalized depots and 
manufacturing operations, 
• Hospitality agreements,
• Joint tanker and pipeline 
utilization, and 
• Joint actions on oil spill control 
and fire prevention.
In this light, the DOE continuously 
monitors the existing joint and 
rationalized operation of depots of Shell, 
Caltex and Petron. Since construction 
and operation of oil depots incur 
huge amount of investments, the government 
encourages oil players to practice the joint 
industry activity to remain competitive in terms 
of fuel pricing. Relatedly, the DOE issued D.C. No 
2011-03-0003 on 02 March 2011 enjoining oil 
companies to engage in mutual product supply 
accommodations and similar industry practices 
to stabilize oil supply. 
Crude Oil Importation. The country’s crude 
imports grew by 69.6 MMB in 2011 from 2010 
level of 66.8 MMB despite the maintenance 
shutdown conducted by the local refineries.
Total Middle East crudes of 53.0 MMB in
2011 represented 76.1 percent of the overall 
crude mix. Meanwhile, crude from the ASEAN 
region, such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and 
Singapore, with a volume of 2.2 MMB supplied 3.1 
percent of the mix. The remaining 20.8 percent 
was sourced from Other Asia, specifically from
Russia. 
Saudi Arabia remained the top exporter of crude 
into the country supplying about 44.2 percent of 
the total crude requirements in 2011, followed 
by UAE and Iran with 21.2 and 8.4 percent share, 
respectively. Malaysia contributed 3.0 percent 
share while Other Asia (Russia) with about 20.8 
percent share (Table 26). 
During the first half of 2012, total crude oil
importation already reached 36.5 MMB.
Petroleum Product Importation. Full year 2011 
import volume of finished products was down
by 15.7 percent from 54.6 MMB of previous
year’s level to 46.1 MMB, which was partly due 
to increased local refinery production output.
Fuel oil import recorded the biggest drop of 
59.5 percent compared to 2010 level. Diesel
oil, unleaded gasoline, kerosene and LPG fell by 
17.9 percent, 11.4 percent, 13.8 percent and 4.2 
percent, respectively. On the other hand, avturbo

import rose by 36.4 percent. The major players 
(Petron, Chevron and Shell) accounted for 41.0 
percent of the total import volume but with a 
decrease of 29.5 percent from 2010 level of 26.8
MMB to 18.9 MMB. The other industry players’ 
import volume, accounted for the remaining 
59.0 percent.
Meanwhile, local refineries (Petron and
Pilipinas Shell) accounted for 18.5 percent of
the total product imports, while 81.5 percent
was attributed to direct importers. 
Product import mix was comprised mostly of 
diesel oil at 39.9 percent, unleaded gasoline at 
24.2 percent, LPG at 18.2 percent, kerosene/
avturbo at 11.0 percent, fuel oil at 5.0 percent,
and other products at 1.8 percent. 
Total gasoline import reached 45.7 percent of
gasoline demand, while diesel oil import was 
41.2 percent of diesel demand. On the other 
hand, LPG import was 66.5 percent of LPG
demand. Overall, total product import was 43.3 
percent of total products demand.
The Biofuels Act of 2006 mandated the use 
of bioethanol blend for gasoline. However,
considering that the current local ethanol 
production is not sufficient, a total of 877 MB
and 711 MB of bioethanol were imported in 
2010 and 2011, respectively. Currently, the 
Philippine National Standards’ (PNS/DOE) QS 
008:2009 for e-Gasoline specified 10.0 percent
ethanol content as the existing standard for fuel. 
As of first half of 2012, total petroleum product
importation already stood at 28.8 MMB. On the 
other hand, ethanol importation was recorded 
at 07 MMB for the same period
Refinery Production. The countrys maximum
working crude distillation capacity is 275
thousand barrels per stream day (MBSD). 
Total crude oil processed in 2011 increased 
by 5.1 percent from 65.9 MMB in 2010 to 69.3
MMB. Vis-à-vis last year, the reported refinery
utilization also improved from 65.0 percent
to 69.1 percent in 2011. 
Consequently, local petroleum refinery
production output also grew by 5.9 percent
from 2010 level of 63.6 MMB to 67.4 MMB. 
Average refining output in 2011 was at
184.6 MB per day. 
Diesel oil and fuel oil continued to dominate 
the production mix with shares of 37.4 and 
19.6 percent, respectively. Unleaded gasoline 
followed next at 19.0 percent share, kerosene/
avturbo and LPG got 10.2 and 6.7 percent share, 
respectively. 
Production of all petroleum products posted 
increases vis-à-vis refinery output in 2011
except keresone/avturbo which recorded a 
decrease of 4.5 percent. Unleaded gasoline
refinery output recorded the largest increase
of 12.2 percent, followed by diesel oil with a 
9.8 percent growth. Likewise, LPG and fuel oil 
refinery output also rose by 6.8 and 2.3 percent,
respectively. 
As of the first half of 2012, local petroleum
refinery production output fell by 16.3 percent
from 33.8 MMB (first half 2011) to 28.2 MMB
with an average refinery output of 155.4 MB per
day. 
PETROLEUM PRODUCT DEMAND
The country’s total demand of petroleum 
products for 2011 registered a decrease of 4.9 
percent from 111.8 MMB a year ago to 106.3 
MMB. This can be translated to an average 
daily requirement of 291.3 MB. Compared with 
2010 demand, fuel oil recorded the largest 
decrease of 29.8 percent in the total demand 
and almost 330 percent drop in the industrial

**Includes alkalyte, asphalts, condensatetrade demand. The decline can be attributed 
to the shutdown of the Manila-Batangas 
Black Oil Pipeline in the last quarter of 2010 
which resulted in difficulty transporting black 
product to industrial trade clients. Demand of 
diesel oil and unleaded gasoline was also down 
a bit by 1.1 and 1.0 percent, respectively. On 
the other hand, demand of kerosene decreased 
by 10.2 percent, while LPG slightly increased 
by 0.6 percent. 
Diesel oil obtained the largest share of 41.9 
percent in the total sales mix, trailed by unleaded 
gasoline, fuel oil, LPG and kerosene/avturbo at 
23.0, 11.8, 11.9 and 10.7 percent, respectively.
As of first semester of 2012, total petroleum
demand already reached 58.5 MMB. Compared
with first half of 2011, all products recorded
increases except fuel oil and LPG which dropped 
by 36.5 and 0.5 percent, respectively. On the
other hand, demand of kerosene/avturbo rose 
by 15.4 percent, while unleaded gasoline and
diesel oil increased by 2.6 and 2.1 percent, 
respectively. 
Figure 43 shows the demand for oil per major 
regional distribution in 2011. The National 
Capital Region was the largest consumer with a 
total consumption of 42.7 MMB or 39.9 percent 
share followed by South Luzon with 18.9 MMB 
or 17.7 percent share. Meanwhile, North 
Luzon’s consumption reached 17.0 MMB or 16.0 
percent, while Mindanao had 13.7 MMB or 13.7 
percent. Visayas was the least consuming 
region with a total consumption of 13.5
MMB or 12.6 percent. 
For the first half of 2012, total demand
of petroleum products already reached 
58.5 MMB, translating to an average daily
requirement of 321.7 MB.
PETROLEUM PRODUCT EXPORTS
Total petroleum products exported 
increased by 12.0 percent in 2011 from 
12.1 MMBin 2010 to 13.5 MMB. On a per product
basis, fuel oil recorded the largest growth of 
121.4 percent vis-à-vis 2010 level. Condensate 
exports also rose by 6.9 percent. On the other 
hand, export of propylene, naptha and toluene 
declined by 34.9, 20.4 and 20.6 respectively. A 
total of 0.3 MMB of Diesel, 0.1 MMB of kerosene 
and 0.1 MMB LPG were also exported during the 
period.
The total export mix comprised of condensate 
(38.8 percent); fuel oil (26.1 percent); naphtha 
(13.0 percent); mixed xylene (6.7 percent); 
propylene (5.3 percent); toluene (3.7 percent);
reformate (2.0 percent); diesel oil (1.9 percent); 
and benzene (1.6 percent).
The oil majors accounted for 61.0 percent of the 
total export mix while the condensate exports 
of SPEX accounted for the remaining 39.0 
percent. Meanwhile, a total of 2,447.0 MB crude 
oil (Palawan Light) was exported to various 
countries during the period.

As of first half of 2012, petroleum exports fell
by 41.6 percent from 7.7 MMB (first half of
2011) to 4.5 MMB. This may be attributed to the
refiner’s shutdown of refineries for turnaround
schedule.
COMPETITION 
The major oil companies (Petron 
Corp., Chevron Phils. and Pilipinas 
Shell Petroleum Corporation) 
captured 68.1 percent market 
share. On the other hand, market 
share of the other players which 
include Petroleum Authority of Thailand 
Philippine Corp. (PTTPC), Total Phils., Seaoil 
Corp., TWA, Inc, Filpride Resources, Phoenix 
Petroleum Liquigaz, Petronas, Prycegas, Micro 
Dragon, Unioil, Isla LPG Corp. and Jetti, as well 
as the end users who directly import part of 
their requirements, acquired 31.9 percent of the 
market.
Meanwhile, the local refiners (Petron Corp.
and Pilipinas Shell) captured 58.4 percent of
the total market demand, while the remaining 
41.6 percent was credited to direct importers/ 
distributors. 
In terms of dealership, the oil majors accounted 
for 75.2 percent of the total number of gasoline
stations in the country in 2011, while the 
remaining was provided by new and independent 
players. Luzon has the most number of gasoline 
stations among the major islands (Table 30). 
As of 2011, the country has a total of 144 depots 
with a total storage capacity of 30.5 MMB
(Table 31). Of the total capacity, 15.2 MMB or
49.8 percent is the combined refinery capacity 
of Petron and Pilipinas Shell located in Bataan 
and Batangas, respectively. 
The remaining 14.1 percent or 4.3 MMB 
capacity of total depot is comprised of storage 
facilities of Petron, Shell and Chevron (with 
aggregate capacity of 2.4 MMB) and other oil 
players (1.9 MMB). Meanwhile, import/export 
terminals for the whole country have a total 
capacity of 10.9 MMB or 35.7 percent of the
total country’s storage capacity. 
Luzon has the most number of depots (including 
import/export terminals) with 73 facilities 
equivalent to 11.5 MMB followed by Visayas

To promote retail competition, the DOE has 
amended the guidelines to improve the program 
and enhance availment facility of the Gasoline 
Station Lending and Financial Assistance 
Program (GSLFAP) of the DOE. The GSLFAP 
extends financial assistance in the form of
medium- to long-term loans with low interest 
rates to prospective industry participants.
LPG
In 2011, Petron and Pilipinas Shell captured 
combined LPG market shares of about 56.0
percent, while the other players obtained 44.0 
percent. Among the other LPG players, Liquigaz 
got the biggest market share with a 26.4 percent 
share, followed by Total Petroleum with 6.7 
percent share. 
For the first half of 2012, Petron’s market share
was 40.0 percent, while other players obtained 
60.0 percent with Liquigaz having the highest 
share of 25.0 percent, Isla Gas with 18.0 percent
and Total Petroleum with 5.0 percent. In January
2012, Pilipinas Shell sold its LPG ownership 
to Isla Gas who is now distributing LPG in the 
industry under the brand name Solane.
To empower consumers in making informedchoice on their purchase of petroleum products, 
the DOE embarked on an aggressive and strategic 
IECcampaign. Seminars/ briefings on LPGSafety
Practices and Liquid Petroleum Products (LPP) 
Retail Rules were likewise conducted in selected 
areas nationwide. Discussions during the IECs 
were comprised of the industry’s regulatory 
framework, safety practices in handling LPG and 
LPP and several proposed policy guidelines that 
intend to improve and further strengthen the 
monitoring capability of the DOE. 
In order to harmonize the various laws, existing 
rules and regulations and issuances governing 
the LPG industry, a D.C. was drafted for 
household LPG titled “LPG Retail Rules.” The 
circular would serve as the framework for the 
LPG sector that further encourages the industry 
players to observe and implement good business 
practices. Similar with other laws and circulars, 
violations that are detrimental to the interest of 
both players and consumers would be penalized 
accordingly. 
PRICE
Political unrest in the Middle East and North 
Africa since late part of 2010 contributed to 
higher oil prices and added instability to energy 
markets. Supply disruptions and early fears on 
the possible spread of unrest to major exporters 
have pushed prices higher, consequently 
resulting to negative impacts on the economies 
of oil importing countries like the Philippines. 
As safety nets, the government issued the 
following policy directives: 
• D.C. 2011-03-0002 issued on 28 February 
2011 requiring all oil companies and bulk 
suppliers operating in the country to increase 
their Minimum Inventory Requirement 
(MIR) from seven (7) days inventory 
equivalent to 15 days for all oil companies
except refiners. On the other hand, refiners’
in-country inventory equivalent of crude 
and finished products has likewise been
increased from 15 days to 30 days. This is
to ensure continuous supply of oil in cases 
where domestic and international events 
threaten or restrict the supply of the same 
in the country;
• Administrative Order (A.O.) No. 6 issued on 
03 March 2011 organizing the Inter-agency 
Energy Contingency Committee (IECC) 
to ensure the continuous, adequate and 
Table 32. DEPOT AND STORAGE CAPACITY BY MAJOR 
 ISLANDS (in MMB), 2011

Visayas 36 1.88
Mindanao 33 1.92
Total 142 15.28
stable supply of petroleum and other energy 
sources in the country;
• D.C. 2011-03-0004 signed on 15 March
2011 enjoining strict compliance of the
downstream oil industry participants to 
the reportorial requirements of RA No. 
8479 and other related issuances. It further 
requires all oil companies to submit a weekly 
inventory of their supply; and,
• E.O. No. 32 signed on 01 April, 2011 
instituting the Public Transport Assistance 
Program (PTAP) or “Pantawid Pasada” 
Program to provide assistance to the public 
transport sector and to cushion the impact 
of high fuel prices and the resulting effects 
on the public transport sector, the riding 
public and consuming public. 
Per E.O. 32, the PTAP shall partially subsidize 
the average consumption of the identified
public transport group. The program was 
implemented in close coordination with Land 
Transportation Franchising and Regulatory 
Board and Land Transportation Office
through the Department of Transportation 
and Communication, Armed Forces of the 
Philippines, and the local government units 
through the Department of Interior and 
Local Government. 
Further, the oil companies, in collaboration with 
the DOE, continued to offer price discounts on 
diesel fuel being sold in participating gasoline 
stations. The number of participating outlets 
in 2011 already reached 608 from only 239 
outlets in 2004, the first year of the project’s
implementation. For the first half of 2012, there
are about 779 participating gasoline stations 
nationwide.
In case of violations or abuse in the price of 
petroleum products, adequate safeguards 
are provided under the law to ensure healthy 
competition and non-proliferation of cartels and 
monopolies in the industry. Among this is the 
enhancement of the DOE-DOJ Task Force that 
addresses unreasonable rise in prices pursuant 
to paragraph (d) of Section 14 of R.A. 8479. Any 
report of an unreasonable rise in the prices 
of petroleum products shall be immediately 
acted upon. For this purpose, the Task Force
is mandated to determine within 30 days the 
merits of the report and initiate the necessary 
actions warranted under the circumstance.
Following the signing of E.O. 850 in compliance
to the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA)/ASEAN 
Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA), the DOE 
pursued the elimination of tariff rates for crude 
and petroleum products regardless of source. 
This is to eliminate negative tariff differential 
for crude oil and finished products with the
implementation of E.O. 850, whereby the raw
material would have a higher tariff of 3.0 percent, 
since crude oil is sourced mostly from the Middle 
East, than the finished products, which are
usually sourced from the ASEAN region. This 
has resulted in the signing and implementation 
of E.O. 890 (Modifying the nomenclature and 
the rates of import duty on crude oil, petroleum 
products and asphalt under Section 104 of the 
Tariff and Customs Code of 1978 (P.D. 1464), 
which took effect in July 2010.
In the absence of a pricing formula, the DOE 
continued with the use of the Automatic Pricing 
Mechanism (APM) of then Energy Regulatory 
Board (ERB) as a guide in its assessment. With 
this, the peso landed cost of bringing in the 
finished oil products to the domestic market is
compared on a week-on-week basis using the 
price build-up.
While the original ERB formula was applied 
on a monthly basis, the present weekly timing 
was adopted starting 2009 upon consultation 
by the DOE with both the oil industry players 
and the consumers, including the transport 
and industrial sectors. The objective of such 
application is to implement a more transparent 
and timely adjustment. Moreover, the weekly 
timing considers the fact that products bought 
last week from Singapore are likely the ones 
being sold in the Philippine market this week.It may be noted further that this formula 
does not consider costs beyond importation, 
e.g. storage, handling, distribution/retailing, 
logistics, as well as costs associated with the 
biofuels program such as the cost of the biofuels 
- bioethanol and biodiesel.
In January 2011, responding to public call for 
more transparency, the ERB formula was posted 
in the DOE website along with other alternative 
formulas suggested by different groups and 
individuals considering the limitations on Mean 
of Platts Singapore (MOPS) data sharing. 
Meanwhile the DOE continuously monitors the 
daily international prices such as Dubai, Brent 
and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for crude 
oil, and MOPS for petroleum products. For 
monitoring purposes, adjustments in domestic 
prices are estimated using two (2) reference 
benchmarks, i.e. Dubai for crude and MOPS for 
petroleum products incorporating the impact of 
foreign exchange adjustments. 
Based on available data, the Philippines enjoys 
the second to the lowest fuel prices among 
non-oil exporting countries in the region, next 
to Thailand. Table 33 provides for comparative 
prices showing Philippines’ highlighted Diesel 
and Unleaded Gasoline prices per liter at PhP 
44.90 and PhP 54.50, respectively.
The prevailing retail prices, as well as the levels of 
adjustments effected by the oil players, are also 
posted and updated every time the adjustments 
are implemented. The per company-based retail 
prices in Metro Manila, Visayas and Mindanao 
are also presented in the DOE website.
STANDARDS FORMULATION 
The DOE, in coordination and consultation 
with the oil companies, vehicle manufacturing 
industries and other government agencies, 
continuously undertakes standard-setting 
activities guided by international/regional 
standards and trends on fuel and fuel-related 
products. Consultations are ongoing to establish 
timelines by which the DOE, through the 
products standards-development process, can 
start the introduction of EURO IV fuels into 
the country from the current EURO II level. 
The agreed timelines would correspondingly 
trigger assessments in the type and scope of 
investments to be financed by the private sector
in the petroleum industry and in the vehicle 
manufacturing sector. EURO IV will be introduced 
in 2016. This continuing development towards 
cleaner fuels is given more impetus with the 
greater awareness on the cause and effect of 
climate change brought about by burning fossil 
fuels. 
In 2010 and 2011, the DOE in collaboration with 
relevant government agencies established/ 
updated several technical standards for 
products (QS) and facilities (FS) in support of 
the downstream oil industry sector (Table 34). 
The existing standards in place include those 
for Coconut Methyl Ester-B100 (PNS/DOE QS 
002:2007), Anhydrous Bioethanol Fuel-E100 
(PNS/DOE QS 007:2005), Liquefied Petroleum
Gases- LPG, (PNS/DOE QS 005:2005), Fuel OilsBunker (PNS/DOE QS 006:2005), Kerosene
(PNS/DOE QS 09:2007), and Two-stroke (2T) 
lubricating oil (PNS/DOE QS 003:2003).
Further, with the inclusion of biofuels and other 
clean fuels in the market as envisioned in the 
Clean Air Act and the Biofuels Act, technical

standards and regulations have been developed 
and improved to complement current thrust on 
alternative fuels, as well as conventional fuels. 
As such, a fuel quality standards roadmap is 
being proposed to be formulated to cover higher 
biofuels blends and other alternative fuels to be 
introduced in the market within the planning 
period.
MONITORING AND ENFORCEMENT
In line with the effective monitoring and 
enforcement of the rules on the LPP and LPG 
industries, and in the spirit of transparency 
and good governance, the DOE prepared an 
Inspector’s Manual in collaboration with the 
Philippine Information Agency (PIA) with the 
objective of enhancing its inspection procedure.
Meanwhile, to address the increasing complaints 
on proliferation of unsafe and unlawful practices 
including smuggling of petroleum products, the 
DOE is closely working with other government 
agencies such as the Bureau of Customs (BOC) 
to put an end to the revenue losses due to 
oil smuggling. In this context, Department 
Circular on the “Guidelines for Petroleum 
Products Importations and Exportations.” Is 
being proposed to specifically address the
need to further strengthen, clarify, amend 
and/or repeal existing rules and regulations 
governing the importation and exportation of 
petroleum products. With the issuance of the 
guidelines, only the DOE-accredited importers 
and exporters shall be allowed to engage in 
such downstream oil activities. Likewise, only 
accredited import terminals shall be allowed to 
receive and store imported petroleum products. 
Moreover, discussions with the oil companies 
have been initiated on the use of market dyes 
for tagging of petroleum sources and revenues. 
Discussions have also been led by the DOE on 
how to curb smuggling at various points in the 
supply chain, including resource requirements. 
The DOE is also actively participating in the 
Inter-Agency Working Group on Oil Smuggling. 
Development Challenges
As a result of nationwide consultations, the 
following are the challenges identified by the
DOE for the downstream oil industry sector:
• Need to ensure oil supply security through 
the formulation of the oil contingency plan to 
cushion impact of soaring price of petroleum

paramaters to be observed by oil companies to allow the introduction and 
use of up to B5.products, establishment of strategic oil 
stockpile, provision of additional oil 
distribution infrastructure and expansion of 
oil refineries.
• Need to promote transparency in oil 
prices and review of oil price formulas and 
methodologies to create public awareness 
on oil pricing. 
• Need to strengthen public-private 
partnership and ensure industry players’ 
adherence to standards, rules and 
regulations.
Plans and Programs
A. Update Oil Supply Contingency Plan
The DOE shall update the oil supply contingency 
plan to incorporate some related emergency 
preparedness mechanisms adopted by the IEA 
member countries in the context of Philippine 
situation. Among the strategies include 
constant monitoring and forecasting of market 
developments together with regular reviews as 
well as preparation and testing of emergency 
policies and procedures. It would also look at the 
short- and medium-term developments in the 
international oil market, world oil supply and 
demand, refinery facilities, biofuels, inventory,
and price developments.
B. Develop/Establish Strategic Oil Stockpile 
The DOE will take the lead in developing policies 
for the establishment of oil stockpiling program 
to protect the country from the economic 
impacts of oil supply disruptions and sharp 
increases in oil prices.
C. Provide Additional Oil Distribution 
infrastructure 
The need for additional oil distribution 
infrastructure is crucial in transporting 
petroleum products from the refineries, ports
and large terminals to dispersing markets all 
over the country. The long distance and variety of 
transportation modes used can pose challenges 
for the refiners that must maintain strict product
specifications. Degradation or contamination of
the products in transit can result in costly reprocessing at the delivery point. Thus, adequate 
distribution infrastructures must be put in place 
to enable refiners to comply with environmental
regulations, which will result in cleaner and 
more stringent product characteristics.
D. Expand / Upgrade Oil Refineries 
The country has limited refinery base and
existing capacity making it “highly susceptible” 
to shortages in the supply of petroleum products. 
Its susceptibility is further heigthened by the 
stringent fuel quality specifications required
by the Clean Air Act which make it difficult
for refiners to meet the petroleum products
demand of the country. Thus, the government 
encourages investors to expand/upgrade new 
storage facilities and construct new refineries
to address this concern. 
E. Improve Guidelines to Encourage 
Competition 
The government will continue to improve 
the business climate through improvement 
of guidelines and the institution of sufficient
regulatory safeguards, complemented 
by strong government monitoring and 
enforcement capability. These mechanisms 
will be strengthened to ensure a fair return 
on investments and weed out unscrupulous 
business practices.
Pursuant to the provisions of R.A. 8479 and in 
order to promote active and direct participation 
of the private sector in the retailing of petroleum 
products, the GSLFAP has been established 
to provide credit assistance to new industry 
participants who successfully completed the twofold training program on skills and management 
for the establishment and operation of a gasoline 
station.However, stringentloan qualifications and
conditions limit new entrants’ availment of the 
said Program. With this, the DOE has amended the 
guidelines providing wider coverage on eligible 
loan purposes, lowering of equity requirement 
and increase in loanable amount, among others. 
Meanwhile, the DOE will continue to monitor 
the activities of industry players as part of its 
regulatory vigilance functions and ensure that 
unscrupulous business practices are deterred. To 
enhance consumer safety and welfare, monitoring 
activities in the quantity and quality of LPP and 
LPG being dispensed in the retail stations will be 
heightened. 
F. Taxation Issues (Duty, Excise, VAT, Real 
Estate Tax)
Issues on taxation particularly on imported raw 
and locally refined petroleum products will be
clarified and resolved with the DOE and the
Department of Finance (DOF) working together 
towards this end. 
Related concerns such as the growing clamor for 
the removal of 12.0 percent VAT on petroleum 
products is seen to help lower the domestic 
prices. However, this translates to a billion peso
loss of government revenues, which would in 
turn impact on vital projects and programs of 
the government. As such, the DOF position is 
to use/allocate the oil tax collection to specific
and direct pro-poor programs. Coordination 
activities are being conducted by the DOE 
together with DOF, Tariff Commission, BOC, and 
the NEDA on this initiative.
G. Strict Enforcement of Importation Rules 
Importation rules under the downstream oil 
deregulation shall be strictly enforced. The law 
requires any company or individual who wants 
to engage in any activity in the downstream 
oil industry, to include importation of crude 
or petroleum products, to comply with the 
requirements as stipulated in the IRR of the Oil 
Deregulation Law, particularly the reportorial 
requirement. Players who shall import 
crude oil and/or petroleum products from 
foreign countries, freeports, and economic 
zones, whether for trade or for his own use or 
requirement are required to file a notice with the
DOE prior to actual loading of every importation 
indicating details and accompanying documents. 
Failure to comply with this rule, the industry 
player will be penalized in accordance with the 
provision of Section 26 of the IRR. 
H. Promote Transparency of Oil Prices 
The promotion of transparency of oil prices in 
a deregulated environment is crucial. The DOE 
having no control over oil price movement shall 
monitor the prices in the market and determine 
its reasonableness. Likewise, the review and 
transparency of oil price methodologies is 
imperative. Oil companies are requested to 
submit sample price build-up beyond the 
landed cost of imports plus taxes and duties. 
These calculations are used to assess their price 
components and bases of price adjustments. 
To further promote transparency, it shall be 
proposed that an Audit Committee be created to 
inspect and audit the books of the members of 
the Petroleum Institute of the Philippines (PIP). 
I. Mitigate Impact of High Oil Prices
The DOE will continue to find ways to mitigate
the impact of high oil prices to the general public. 
It shall continue to encourage oil companies to 
sustain the granting of discount on diesel to the 
public transport sector, as well as increase the 
number of participating retail stations. Priority 
measures seen to mitigate the impact of oil price 
hikes may include the following: 
· Provision of fuel discounts to transport 
workers and direct subsidy to vulnerable 
sectors;
· Deregulation of public land transport fares; 
and
· Institutionalization of the two-tier pricing 
system for diesel to provide a lower pump price for the public transport sector. This 
approach would require the support from 
the oil companies as well as clear guidelines 
from the DOE-DOF as to how to integrate 
cross-product subsidies in their pump 
pricing. 
J. Minimize Economic Oil Leakage and 
Operationalize Marker Technology to 
Address Smuggling
The local cost of petroleum crude and 
products is affected by illegal activities like 
smuggling, pilferage and adulteration. Rampant 
pilferage of fuels is caused by inefficiencies in
distribution chains both by sea-going and landbased tankers. This will likewise lead to fuel 
adulteration if the distribution is not properly 
monitored. The priority actions proposed 
are: strict enforcement of rules on petroleum 
product distribution and use; installing of Global 
Positioning System trackers on sea-going and 
land-based oil tankers; and, institutionalizing 
a monitoring mechanism and product tracking 
system. 
The DOE and the BOC are continuously 
coordinating in comparing the data/reports 
submitted by oil companies. Accreditation of 
import terminals has also been proposed to 
curb oil smuggling.
Meanwhile, the operationalization of the new 
marker technology is another scheme that will 
be implemented to curb rampant smuggling 
in the oil industry. The current marker dye 
system can only detect adulteration. But the 
new marking technology is so efficient that
the source of the fuel product can be traced or 
detected, making it useful for the DOE in its antismuggling drive. 
Another strategy to address concerns on 
smuggling is the proposed establishment of 
online database by the DOE. All documents 
necessary prior to the engagement in any 
activity or business in the downstream industry 
such as application for importation, reportorial 
requirements and other documents as embodied 
in the implementing rules and regulations of 
R.A. 8479 shall be submitted online by the 
industry players. Said proposal is intended to 
be linked in due time to DOF’s Single Window 
Program of the government. On the other hand, 
the proposed creation of the anti-smuggling 
task force intends to minimize, if not eradicate, 
smuggling activities in the country. To date, the 
creation is still underway and the constitution 
of the task force, as well as the scope of work, is 
still being worked on, among others. 
K. Promoting Awareness on the Downstream 
Oil Industry Initiatives and Development
The DOE will continuously undertake IEC 
campaign to empower consumers by providing 
them with basic and necessary information on 
downstream oil industry activities, specifically
at the grassroots level or in the barangays. 
 
Similarly, the DOE will continue its regular 
meetings and consultations with the industry 
players or stakeholders and jointly agree on 
possible measures to address emerging oilrelated issues.
Natural Gas Industry 
Development
Natural gas is an important component of the 
government’s fuel diversification program
and considered as one of the most viable 
alternatives to oil-based energy, particularly in 
the power generation, industrial processes and 
transportation. 
The launching of the Malampaya Gas-to-Power 
Project (MGPP) in 2001 catalyzed the birth of 
the gas industry in the Philippines. Since then, 
natural gas has contributed significantly in the
country’s primary energy supply and power 
generation. The biggest challenge confronting 
the sector is the necessary infrastructure 
development that needs to be put in place 
to further promote and intensify the use of 
natural gas not only for power but also in nonpower applications. A number of concerns had 
caused delay in infrastructure development 
such as uncertainties in supply availability and 
sustainability, as well as the assurance of an 
anchor market that would justify the required 
investments. 
To address these challenges, the government 
has initiated various options and strategies 
for the industry’s expansion.. The declared 
additional supply of natural gas from 
Malampaya sparked renewed interest from 
industry players and potential stakeholders. 
Further, the government’s energy development 
investment arm, the PNOC, has revived its effort 
to pursue the implementation of the much 
awaited Batangas-to-Manila pipeline (BatMan 
1). Several proposals from private companies 
signifying interest to venture into business in 
different aspects of the gas value chain have also 
been received by the government. Meanwhile, 
unless new resources are discovered, natural 
gas imports will be necessary to supplement 
the production limits of the Malampaya gas field
in order to meet the projected demand coming 
from various potential markets of natural gas. 
The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) Energy Policy Roundtable54 and the 
Joint Transportation and Energy Ministerial 
Conference55 in California, USA on 12-13 
September 2011 provided an opportunity for 
the DOE to share the country’s plan to develop 
the required infrastructure to expand the 
utilization of natural gas or liquefied natural
gas (LNG), which is globally known as a 
strategic alternative clean fuel option. Given the 
important role of natural gas in attaining energy 
security as well as providing a clean alternative 
fuel for transport the government has all the 
reasons to fast track the establishment of a more 
competitive and investor-friendly downstream 
natural gas industry in the country. 
Performance Assessment
POLICY INITIATIVE
To accelerate the development of the downstream 
natural gas industry, the government recognizes 
the urgency to have a clear and comprehensive 
policy regulatory framework as a requisite for 
its development. 
The proposed Natural Gas Bill aims to provide 
a platform that would encourage investments 
for the required infrastructure, as well as in 
the expansion of the country’s natural gas 
supply base. In support of this objective, five
(5) versions of the bill (pending from both the
Senate and House of Representatives) titled
“Downstream Natural Gas Industry Development 
Act” were filed under the 15th Congress. 
Currently, the activities covering the 
implementation of downstream natural gas 
industry are governed by DOE Circular No. 
54 The APEC Energy Policy Roundtable is a high-level policy 
discussion on energy security, structured to engage senior APEC 
officials and private sector executives on current pressing policy 
concerns in the region. 
55 The APEC Transportation and Energy Ministerial Conference 
is a public-private dialogue that included leaders from the 
private sector which focused on four (4) themes, (1) Vision for 
Strengthening Transportation’s Role in Clean Energy Future; (2) 
Developing Energy Efficient Transportation Systems for Livable 
Low-Carbon Communities; (3) Powering Low-Carbon Transport – 
Electricity, Biofuels, and Natural Gas; and (4) Greening the Supply 
Chain Energy Efficient Freight Transportation95-06-006 “Policy Guidelines on the Overall 
Development and Utilization of Natural Gas 
in the Philippines” issued in 1995; and DOE
Circular Nos. 2002-07-004 “Rules of Practice 
and Procedure Before the DOE” and 2002-08-
005 “Interim Rules and Regulations Governing 
the Transmission, Distribution and Supply of 
Natural Gas,” both issued in 2002. 
PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY SECURITY 
Gas production exhibited a 7.7 percent increase 
from 130 BSCF of gas in 2010 to 140 BSCF in 
2011. Similarly, the gas condensate displayed a 
4.1 percent increase from 4.9 MMB in 2010 to 
5.1 MMB in 2011. The climb in production for
both gas and condensate was dependent on the 
nominated volumes of gas needed by the three 
(3) natural gas-fired power plants in Luzon and
the refinery. Likewise, the implementation
of the scheduled preventive maintenance 
shutdown of the Malampaya shallow water 
platform had also affected the production. 
Aggregate production from Malampaya gas field
already reached 1.1 trillion cubic feet (TCF), and 
for the first semester of 2012, gas production
registered at 72.6 BSCF, while condensate yield 
stood at 2.5 MMB.
On the other hand, the Libertad Gas Field in 
Bogo, Libertad, Cebu, with an estimated reserve 
of about 0.6 BCF, has been made available 
to potential stakeholders. The Gas Sales and 
Purchase Agreement (GSPA) between Forum 
Exploration, Inc. and DESCO, Inc. was signed 
(January 2009) to provide the necessary gas 
supply for a 1.0 MW power plant in the area. 
Said power plant was commissioned in February 
2012. 
As an industry development option, the DOE 
granted a Provisional Permit to Energy World 
Corporation Ltd. (EWCL) in January 2011. For 
the construction of an LNG storage facility in 
Pagbilao, Quezon. 
Earlier, an MOU extension was granted by the 
DOE to a Korean Consortium composed of South 
Korea Engineering & Construction Company 
Limited, Korea Western Power Company, and 
Archinet International Incorporated in February 
2010 for the conduct of a feasibility study of an 
LNG underground storage and regasification
facility in Mariveles, Bataan. The pre-feasibility 
study report for the LNG terminal and power 
project was submitted to the DOE in October 
2010.
MARKET DEVELOPMENT 
Currently, the three (3) natural gas-fired
power plants in Luzon (1,200-MW Ilijan GasFired Power Plant, 1,000-MW Sta. Rita GasFired Power Plant, and 500-MW San Lorenzo
Gas-Fired Power Plant) are the main market 
of natural gas in the country. As of 2011, the 
power plants consumed a total of 133.22 BSCF 
to generate 20,591 GWh of electric power. This
accounted for a 29.8 percent share to total gross 
generation nationwide. 
The alternative application of natural gas in the 
transport sector is also pursued through the 
Natural Gas Vehicle Program for Public Transport 
(NGVPPT). From a minimal volume of CNG 
utilization in 2008 following the inauguration 
of the pilot mother and daughter refueling 
system in October 2007, the total consumption 
of natural gas for the transport sector already 
reached 46.5 MMSCF in 2011 and 23.0 MMSCF
for the first semester of 2012. A total of 61
CNG-fed buses are in country, of which 41 are 
already plying along the routes of BatangasLaguna-Manila. These buses are operated 
by KL Transport, RRCG, HM Transport, BBL,
Greenstar and N. De la Rosa. 
Apart from the power and transport sectors, 
natural gas is also being used by Pilipinas Shell 
Petroleum Corporation’s (PSPC) refinery for its
on-site process energy requirements. In 2011, 
the refinery consumed a total of 3.3 BSCF of
natural gas and 1.2 BSCF for the first half of
2012.
INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT
The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the update of 
the 2002 Master Plan Study for the Development 
of the Natural Gas Industry in the country56
was signed on 30 March 2011 by the Japan 
International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and 
the DOE. Likewise, as a complementary effort, 
World Bank (WB) also conducted a study on the 
feasibility of supplying natural gas in Mindanao. 
The study involved a review of current and 
existing LNG transportation, receiving, storage 
and regasification approaches, and the analysis
of a suitable LNG terminal site in the region. 
The WB study also revisited the identified LNG
sites in the Bataan peninsula. The final reports
of the JICA and WB studies were completed 
and presented to DOE in March and June 2012, 
respectively. 
Another complimentary study was conducted by 
WB, titled “Mindanao Natural Gas Development 
Strategy” with the primary goal of determining 
the region’s possible access to the international 
gas market so that a competitive, clean fuel is 
available for use in power generation. However,
Mindanao could only provide an anchor market 
for an LNG facility that is modest in size, and 
its economics will improve if there is a good 
plan for parallel development of other natural 
gas markets proximate to where the terminal 
could be established. Thus, demand assessment 
was conducted in Davao, General Santos, Iligan, 
Cagayan de Oro and PHIVIDEC Ecozone in
Misamis Oriental. The study would likewise 
cover some issues and options for distribution 
of natural gas, policy and regulatory analysis for

Philippines was completed in January 2002 with support from 
JICA.
the preferred option, as well as infrastructure 
development plan for natural gas distribution in 
Mindanao. 
Meanwhile, in June 2012, the DOE entered into 
an agreement with PSPC for the conduct of a 
technical feasibility study on a Floating Storage 
Regasification Unit (FSRU), to be placed in the
province of Batangas. 
CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT
To create a sustainable development for 
the industry, particularly on providing the 
necessary technical skills and manpower in 
the downstream natural gas industry, a joint 
undertaking with the Polytechnic University of 
the Philippines (PUP) was initiated to establish 
the first Natural Gas Institute (NGI) in the
country. Said Institute is envisioned not only 
to provide the necessary capacity building 
requirement of the industry but also to make 
our local expertise globally competitive. 
Measurable Sectoral Targets 
The key to a successful establishment of 
the downstream natural gas industry is the 
development of the necessary infrastructure that 
will facilitate the delivery of gas to the end-users 
as well as the availability of a sustainable supply of 
natural gas. Currently, the Malampaya gas field is
the country’s only source of natural gas. Although 
the government is pushing on the development of 
indigenous gas resources through the conduct of 
PECR, ensuring supply security also necessitates 
looking into the economics of importing natural 
gas in the form of LNG. 
Luzon
Critical infrastructure projects initially 
identified in Luzon will be pursued during
the planning period as shown in (Table 35).
Nine (9) transmission pipeline networks are 
proposed to be developed in Luzon, namely: the

nominated	   volumes	   of	   gas	   needed	   by	   the	   three	  
(3)	   natural	   gas-­‐fired	   power	   plants	   in	   Luzon and	  
the	  refinery.	  	  	  Likewise,	  the	  implementation	  of	  the	  
scheduled preventive	   maintenance	   shutdown	   of	  
the	  Malampaya	  shallow	   water	   platform	   had	   also	  
affected	   the	   production. Aggregate	   production	  
from	   Malampaya	   gas	   field	   already	   reached	   1.1	  
trillion	  cubic	  feet	  (TCF), and	  for the	  first	  semester	  
of	   2012,	   gas	   production registered at 72.6 BSCF,	  
while	  condensate	  yield	  stood	  at	  2.5 MMB.	  
On	  the	  other	  hand,	  the	  Libertad	  Gas	  Field in	  Bogo,	  
Libertad,	   Cebu, with	   an	   estimated	   reserve	   of	  
about	   0.6	   BCF, has	   been	   made	   available	   to	  
potential	   stakeholders. The Gas	   Sales	   and	  
Purchase	   Agreement	   (GSPA)	   between	   Forum	  
Exploration, Inc.	   and	   DESCO,	   Inc.	   was	   signed
(January	   2009)	   to	   provide	   the necessary	   gas	  
supply	  for	  a	  1.0	  MW power	  plant	  in	  the	  area.	  Said	  
power	  plant	  was	  commissioned	  in	  February 2012.
As	   an	   industry	   development	   option, the	   DOE	  
granted	   a	   Provisional	   Permit	   to	   Energy	   World	  
Corporation	  Ltd.	  (EWCL)	  in	  January	  2011.	  	  For	  the	  
construction	  of	  an	  LNG	  storage	  facility	  in	  Pagbilao,	  
Quezon.	  
Earlier,	   an MOU	   extension	   was	   granted	   by	   the	  
DOE	   to	  a	  Korean	  Consortium	  composed	  of	  South	  
Korea	   Engineering &	   Construction	   Company	  
Limited,	   Korea	   Western	   Power	   Company,	   and

LNG underground	   storage	   and	   regasification	  
facility in	   Mariveles,	   Bataan.	   The	   pre-­‐feasibility	  
study report for	   the	   LNG	   terminal	   and	   power

Currently,	   the	   three	   (3)	   natural	   gas-­‐fired	   power	  
plants	  in	  Luzon	  (1,200-­‐MW	  Ilijan	  Gas-­‐Fired	  Power

and	  500-­‐MW	  San	  Lorenzo	  Gas-­‐Fired	  Power	  Plant)	  
are the	  main	  market	  of	  natural	  gas	  in	  the	  country.	  
As	  of	  2011,	  the	  power	  plants	  consumed	  a	  total	  of
133.22 BSCF	  to	   generate 20,591 GWh	   of	   electric	  
power.	  This	  accounted	  for	  a	  29.8 percent	  share	  to
total	  gross	  generation	  nationwide.	  	  
The	   alternative	   application	   of	   natural	   gas	   in	   the	  
transport	   sector	   is	   also	   pursued	   through	   the	  
Natural	  Gas	  Vehicle	  Program	   for	  Public	  Transport	  
(NGVPPT).	   From	   a	   minimal	   volume	   of	   CNG

the	  pilot	  mother	  and	  daughter	  refueling	  system in	  
October	   2007,	   the	   total	   consumption	   of	   natural	  
gas	   for	  the	  transport	  sector	  already	  reached	  46.5
MMSCF in 2011 and	   23.0 MMSCF	   for	   the	   1st

distribution network – the EDSA-Taft Gas 
Pipeline (ET Loop). 
The BatMan 1 Project is considered the 
backbone infrastructure with an estimated 
distance of 105-km. high-pressure gas
transmission pipeline from Batangas to 
Sucat. It is expected to operate commercially 
by 2017. It will deliver the necessary gas 
requirements for the economic zones 
located along the route from Tabangao, 
Batangas to Sucat, Parañaque, and the 
transport sector for the CNG-fuelled buses 
and taxis. By 2020, said pipeline will be 
extended to Quirino highway going to the 
Mall of Asia in Pasay City. On the other hand, 
the supply of natural gas for the Batman 
1 pipeline will come initially from the 
production of the Malampaya gas field and
will be supplemented by LNG importation 
in 2020. 
On the other hand, the BatMan 2 Project is 
a 140-km. high pressure pipeline that will 
serve possible markets such as the Limay 
combined- cycle power plant, which can 
be converted to natural gas-fired plant,
and economic zones notably Subic and 
Clark including industries located along the 
route. Central Luzon and even the National 
Capital Region (NCR) will also be served 
with supply coming from the proposed LNG 
import terminals located either in Mariveles 
or Limay in the province of Bataan. As 
a network, Batman 2 will connect with 
Batman 1 via the 40-km undersea BataanCavite (BatCave) and through the 35-km.
Rosario, Cavite to Biñan, Laguna (RoBin) 
spurline. Likewise, it can also be connected 
to the Manila area via the ET Loop. The 
target year of completion for the BatMan 1 
Project would be for the period 2015-2017,
while BatMan 2 would be operational by 
2020 (Table 35).
Four (4) additional pipelines will be 
constructed. These are: the 40-km. Subic

in Pillilia, Rizal; and, the shortest is the 15-
km. Sucat-Fort Bonifacio pipeline that will 
service the requirement of the industries and 
commercial establishments in Fort Bonifacio, 
Global City in Taguig City. 
Similarly, the BatCave is a 40-km. undersea high 
pressure gas transmission pipeline designed 
to transmit gas from Bataan province passing 
through Cavite province to Metro Manila via 
Batman 1. Another pipeline project will also be 
available – the 40 km. gas pipeline along EDSATaft Avenue or the ET Loop. It is expected to 
supply gas to large commercial establishments, 
as well as for transport vehicles that ply around 
the Metro Manila area. 
Another critical infrastructure project is the 
LNG Terminal. The entry of LNG terminals in the 
country will augment the current natural gas 
supply coming from the Malampaya gas field to
meet the projected demand of gas in the country. 
There are three (3) LNG Import Terminal projects 
being lined up in Luzon – the Pagbilao LNG Hub
Terminal in Quezon, and the LNG Terminals in 
Batangas and Bataan. The Pagbilao LNG Hub
Terminal has two (2) storage tanks – each has a 
capacity of 130,000 cubic meter (cu.m.). As an 
initial anchor market to the LNG terminal, 300-
MW combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power 
plants (2 x 150-MW) will be constructed in two
(2) phases. It is expected to start operating in 
2014. However, the expected LNG supply that
will come from the terminal hub is assumed 
to be distributed to other potential markets in 
Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao aside from its 
own-used requirements. An LNG Terminal in 
Batangas is targeted to be available between 
the years 2021-2030 to augment the natural 
gas supply for BatMan 1, while the Bataan LNG 
Terminal is seen to be a source of natural gas 
supply for BatMan 2 by 2025.
To provide the CNG supply requirement for 
the 200 CNG buses under the pilot phase 
implementation of NGVPPT, the DOE directed 
PNOC-EC to put up CNG refueling stations by 
2013-2015.
Mindanao
The proposed entry of natural gas in Mindanao 
is expected to kick-off the development of 
infrastructure in the region that would possibly 
spur to the Visayas area. Its entry to the region 
will be a two-phased approach which will cover 
five (5) years (2014-2018). The first phase will
be in the areas of PHIVIDEC Industrial Park,
Cagayan de Oro and Iligan, while the second 
phase will expand in the areas of Davao and 
General Santos. These infrastructure projects 
are necessary to expand the applications of 
natural gas in industries and commercial sectors 
in Mindanao including the possible utilization 
in the transport and agricultural sectors (Table 
35). 
During the planning period, the country is eyeing 
to put up the first FSRU in Mindanao to meet
the rising energy demand in the region. With a 
requirement of 500 MW of anchor load, the said
FSRU will be placed in Macajalar Bay, Misamis 
Oriental and is targeted to be operational in 
2016. Aside from its anchor load, the FSRU will 
also be supplying gas to potential demand areas 
in PHIVIDEC Ecozone, Cagayan de Oro, Iligan
City, General Santos and Davao. 
By 2014, two (2) Satellite Supply Terminals will 
be constructed in conjunction with the FSRU. The 
first Supply Terminal will have a two (2) storage
tanks with a capacity of 120 cu.m. each, which 
will be allocated for the demand in the south 
of Iligan City and Misamis Oriental, while the 
second Supply Terminal will consist of one (1) 
storage tank with a capacity of 120 cu.m. in the 
north of Iligan City. On the other hand, two (2) 
pipelines will also be constructed accordingly to transport and distribute the necessary gas 
to demand areas. These are the: 27.4 k.m. 
pipeline system for the areas of Cagayan de 
Oro and PHIVIDEC Ecozone; and, the 2x2 k.m.
distribution pipeline in Iligan City, which will be 
connected to the said two (2) Satellite Supply 
Terminals. These facilities are expected to be in 
place by 2016. 
Likewise, in anticipation for the demand in the 
transport sector, the government is planning 
to put up Liquefied Compressed Natural Gas
(LCNG) refueling stations in the areas of Iligan, 
Cagayan de Oro and PHIVIDEC Ecozones.
For the demand coming from the provinces of 
General Santos and Davao, a 5-k.m. pipeline and
three (3) satellite LNG terminals coupled with 
LCNG Refueling stations will be constructed 
within the planning period (Table 35). 
 
Development Challenges
The government is keen on expanding the 
utilization of natural gas in different demand 
sectors of the economy. For the planning period, 
the DOE has identified the following issues/
challenges confronting the expansion of the 
sector:
• Need for an integrated set of laws and 
regulations as an important requisite for its 
expansion. 
• Need to put up strategic infrastructure 
facilities to ensure that natural gas is 
delivered continuously to all demand 
sectors, such as the network of high and low 
pressure gas pipelines, receiving terminals 
and pumping stations.
• Institution of a comprehensive incentive 
package that will encourage stakeholders 
to support the required investments for the 
sector.
• Establishment of industry standards to 
ensure safety and increase efficiency in
operations among all the various elements 
in the industry. 
• Need to explore, develop and promote other 
indigenous sources of natural gas to expand 
the supply base.
• Need to develop local technical skills and 
expertise to fill up the requirement of the
natural gas industry as well as to be globally 
competitive.
Plans and Programs 
POLICY INITIATIVE
The DOE will advocate for the approval of 
Natural Gas Bill in Congress. An enabling law 
will establish a clear policy for market, supply 
and infrastructure development. Once the said 
bill is approved and passed into law, the DOE 
will prepare, finalize and implement issuances
such as the IRR, Transmission Code, Distribution 
Code and Supply Code. In addition, the DOE will 
pursue the inclusion of natural gas investments 
in the government’s Investment Priorities Plan 
to ensure investors of wider access to incentive 
packages.
As part of advocacy for the passage of the Natural 
Gas Bill, the DOE will conduct a massive IEC 
activity on natural gas particularly for legislators, 
non-government organizations and the general 
public. The identification and development of
a capacity development program for natural 
gas regulators will be pursued throughout the 
planning period. 
PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY SECURITY
Development of Sustainable Natural Gas 
Supply 
The DOE will continuously support and promote 
the exploration and development of natural gas 
in the country. Likewise, “on-site” or small scale 
power generation using marginal gas-fields will
be promoted. In addition, the DOE is looking 
into the economics of importing natural gas in 
the form of LNG to meet the projected demand 
coming from potential markets of natural gas.
Likewise, the DOE shall strengthen the country’s 
position to establish LNG import terminal 
hub to bring in LNG from nearby countries. In 
anticipation of this, the DOE will monitor and 
evaluate the development of natural gas supply 
in ASEAN, Middle East and APEC member 
economies and at the same time, actively 
participate in regional collaboration and 
dialogues. 
Infrastructure Development
One of the recommendations in the updated 
Master Plan study is to develop a strategy 
or model on how to implement and bid out 
infrastructure projects. The DOE is keen on 
putting up the critical natural gas- related 
infrastructure facilities identified in the said
Master Plan Study (Table 35)through the publicprivate partnership (PPP) scheme. 
MARKET DEVELOPMENT
Promote and Encourage Use of Natural Gas in 
New and Existing Markets
The DOE will put in place mechanisms to 
respond to the growing demand for natural 
gas in the country. In the immediate term, the 
DOE will intensify promotion of natural gas to 
potential industries located along the route of 
the identified gas transmission pipelines. It
will also review and coordinate with concerned 
government agencies the enhancement of 
existing incentive package for the overall 
downstream natural gas program for inclusion 
into the DOE Investment Promotion Program. 
There is also a plan to review the gas pricing 
index provided under the existing GSPA and 
recommend a standard or base price structure 
for gas that would be de-linked from oil. 
Subsequently, this would establish the first
natural gas pricing policy in the country. 
Further, the DOE will conduct an evaluation and 
market research on techno-economic aspects 
of related technologies for possible fuel shift to 
natural gas, as well as vigorously continue the 
profiling of potential gas markets nationwide
throughout the planning period. 
To strengthen the industry, the DOE in 
collaboration with natural gas stakeholders 
will prepare and implement a collegiate levelcurriculum that will introduce energy and 
natural gas in selected courses at PUP and other 
universities in the country. 
 In the absence of local industry standards, 
the proponents or operators of pipelines, and 
transmission- and/or distribution-related 
facilities will conduct the operations of their 
respective facilities in accordance with relevant 
standards promulgated by the International 
Standards Organization (ISO) or other 
internationally-accepted standards as the DOE 
may adopt. Within the planning period, the 
DOE will formulate a Health, Safety, Security and
Environment (HSSE) program for all operators
of existing and incoming natural gas facilities in 
the country.

Power Development Plan
Recognizing that electricity is a key driver for 
rapid economic growth and poverty alleviation, 
the DOE, as mandated by the EPIRA, formulates 
the PDP as an integral component of the PEP. The 
PDP is composed of development plans of the 
Generating Companies (GenCos), Distribution 
Development Plans (DDPs) of the distribution 
utilities (DUs) nationwide and the Transmission 
Development Plan (TDP) of the National Grid 
Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP). The 
PDP also takes into consideration the available 
indigenous resources that may be harnessed 
to meet the domestic power requirement with 
due regard to potential reduction of GHGs and
economically-feasible solutions. 
The 2012-2030 PDP outlines a strategic 
roadmap for the power sector to ensure and 
secure the delivery of a reliable and quality 
electricity supply in the short-, medium-, and 
long-term planning horizon. 
The PDP process has evolved from econometrics 
approach (top-down) to bottom-up approach 
where the DOE aggregates the energy forecasts 
of the individual DUs as indicated in their DDPs, 
embedded generators and directlyconnected customers of NGCP. These 
initial estimates are harmonized 
with the actual power delivery of 
the transmission company. The 
DU forecasts include loads for 
captive markets such as residential 
customers and/or contestable 
markets for existing and future large 
loads.
It is also at this level where power 
suppliers and off-takers (DUs) 
negotiate the bilateral contracts to 
ensure power supply availability in 
the short-, medium-, to long-term 
planning horizon. 
Performance Assessment
The stability and reliability of power supply 
remained a major challenge. Despite the natural 
calamities, adverse effects of climate change 
that hit the country, tension in Middle East and 
the economic situation in the West, there was 
a steady performance of the country’s power 
industry in 2011. 
Capacity
Total installed capacity in the country declined 
by 0.8 percent in 2011 to 16,226.9 MW from 
16,358.9 MW in 2010. This was mainly attributed
to the decommissioning of the 49-MW Northern 
Negros geothermal power plant in June 2011 and 
the non-availability of the 55-MW Tiwi Unit 3 and
the 242.38-MW Duracom Diesel power plant, 
which was on deactivated shutdown since 2006. 
Installed capacity in Luzon was recorded at 
11,811.1 MW, while dependable capacity was 
at 10,824.4 MW. An increase of 3.1 percent 
from 10,498.4 MW in 2010 was due to the 
commissioning of the 3 x 35-MW Ambuklao

hydro facilities during the latter part of 
first semester 2011. The 1st and 2nd units of 
Ambuklao hydro started its operation in last 
June 2011 and the 3rd unit in October 2011. 
Also, the recommissioning and transfer of 
the 116-MW diesel power plant in Subic from 
PSALM to Udenna during the second quarter of 
2011 contributed to the increase in dependable 
capacity of the Luzon grid. 
In the Visayas, the installed capacity was at 
2,393.8 MW with an increased dependable 
capacity of 16.7 percent from 1,744.9 MW in 
2010 to 2,036.8 MW in 2011.
In Mindanao, the stability and reliability of 
power supply remained a major issue with a 
precariously low generation reserve level in 
the island. Even if the existing hydro power 
plants are running in full capacity, the need for 
demand control is necessary due to generation 
deficiency that maybe caused by the scheduled
maintenance and the unexpected shutdown 
or reduced capability of some power plants. 
Thus, a grid-wide power load curtailment was 
implemented in the island to maintain the 
supply-demand balance. The installed capacity 
in Mindanao grid was posted at 2,022.0 MW 
with a reduced dependable capacity of 2.5
percent from 1,658.2 MW in 2010 to 1,615.9
MW in 2011.

GENERATION BY GRID
Gross electricity generation for 2011 reached 
69,176 GWh, posting a minimal increase of 
2.1 percent compared to 67,743 GWh in 2010. 
Generation in Luzon grid declined by 0.5 percent
while Visayas registered a remarkable increase 
of 15.2 percent due to the full commercial
operation of the remaining units of its coal-fired
power plants. In Mindanao, however, despite 
the suppressed demand in view of capacity 
constraints, electricity generation rebounded 
by 3.6 percent owing to the improved stability 
of its hydro facilities. 
In the first half of 2012, total electricity
generation reached 36,077 GWh with the 
following breakdown: 25,843 GWh in Luzon,
5,846 GWh in the Visayas, and 4,388 GWh in
Mindanao. 
GENERATION BY PLANT TYPE
A. Coal
The country’s total generation from coal-fired
power plants increased by 8.8 percent from 
23,301 GWh level in 2010 to 25,342 GWh in
2011. In the Visayas, the increase in use of 
coal for power generation was due to the entry 
of three new coal-fired power plants, namely:
(i) 3 x 82 MW coal-fired plant by Cebu Energy
Development Corporation (CEDC) in April and 
June 2010 (Units 1 and 2) and in January 2011 
(Unit 3); (ii) 2 x 72 MW coal-fired plant by
Panay Energy Development Corporation (PEDC) 
in November 2010 (Unit 1) and April 2011 
(Unit 2); and (iii) 2 x 100 MW by KEPCO-Salcon 
in November 2010 (Unit 1) and March 2011 
(Unit 2). For the Luzon and Mindanao grids, 
electricity generation from their respective 
coal-fired plants decreased due to the scheduled
maintenance and unplanned outages. In Luzon, 
three (3) coal plants went on maintenance to 
include: (i) Calaca Unit 1 (300 MW) in September 
2011; (ii) Pagbilao Unit 1 (382 MW) during the 
whole 4th quarter of 2011; and, (iii) Sual Unit 1 
from 20 August 2012 to 16 October 16 2011. 
The Mindanao Coal Units 1 and 2 were likewise 
on planned outages on 15-24 October 2011 and
16-31 July 2011, respectively. 
For the first semester 2012, coal-fired power
plants contributed 39.3 percent or 14,173 GWh 
to the total electricity generation. In terms of 
additional capacity, the 600-MW coal-fired
power plant of GN Power, which is the first
merchant private sector investment in Luzon 
after the EPIRA implementation, is set to start 
the testing and commissioning of its Unit 1 (300 
MW) by November-December 201257. 
57 Officially recorded testing and commissioning with minimal 
generation was on 31 December 2012 by NGCPB. Oil-Based
For oil-based plants, the country’s 
total generation decelerated by 52.2
percent from 7,101 GWh in 2010 to 
3,398 GWh in 2011. Oil-based power 
plants were frequently dispatched as 
must run units in 2010 to address the 
insufficient reserve capacity in the
Luzon grid. In Mindanao, grid was able 
to cope with the limited hydroelectric 
power plants output, thus generation from its 
oil-based plants were reduced from 2,087 GWh 
in 2010 to 1,424 GWh in 2011. For first semester
2012, oil-based facilities contributed 4.7 percent 
or 1,685 GWh to the total electricity requirement.
C. Natural Gas
Meanwhile, generation from natural gas 
posted an increase of about 5.5 percent in
2011 despite the supply constraint brought by 
the maintenance shutdown of the Malampaya 
natural gas pipeline from 20-26 October 2011. 
Mid-2012 electricity generation data from 
natural gas registered 28.7 percent contribution 
or 10,354 GWh.
D. Geothermal
On the other hand, despite the decommissioning 
of Northern Negros Geothermal Power Plant (49 
MW) and the outage of Palinpinon Geothermal 
for 85 days (19 Sept - 29 Nov) due to main
transformer failure, power generation from 
geothermal power plant accelerated by 0.1 
percent from 9,929 GWh in 2010 compared 
to 9,942 GWh in 2011. The slight increase was 
attributed to the synchronization to the grid of 
Unit 1 ofBacman (55 MW)inDecember 2011 after
being out of service since March 2009. As of June 
2012, generation from geothermal registered at 
5,261 GWh or 14.6 percent of the total. 
E. Hydropower
The country’s total generation from 
hydroelectric power plants posted a significant 
increase of 24.3 percent from 7,803 GWh in 
2010 to 9,698 GWh in 2011. The significant 
increase is driven by the full dispatch of 
Mindanao hydro facilities to address its supply 
shortage. Hydro was also abundant during
the first semester 2012 with a 12.4 percent 
contribution to the total electricity generation 
or 4,481 GWh. 
F. Wind, Solar and Biomass
The combined contribution from emerging 
renewable energy sources such as wind, solar 
and biomass, increased by 126.8 percent in 
2011 from 90 GWh in 2010 to 205 GWh with
a share of 0.3 percent to the total generation. 
The substantial increase was attributed to the 
electricity generated from the 4-MW San Pedro 
Landfill Methane Recovery in Luzon and the
15-MW biomass-fed Central Azucarera de San
Antonio (CASA) in the Visayas. For first half
of 2012, electricity generation from these RE 
sources already reached 125 GWh or 0.4 percent
of the total electricity generation. 
GENERATION BY OWNERSHIP
Generation from NPC power plants increased by 
1,088 GWh or 26.9 percent from 4,053 GWh in
2010 to 5,142 GWh in 2011. The transfer of NPCIPPs, on the other hand to its Administrators 
caused the decrease in electricity output of NPCIPPs from 14,725 GWh in 2010 to 9,536 GWh
in 2011. On the other hand, the non-NPC IPPs 
increased its generation by 11.4 percent from 
the 2010 level of 48,442 GWh to 53,955 GWh.

ELECTRICITY SALES AND CONSUMPTION
Amidst the weakened domestic economy 
brought by the slowdown in global trade, the 
electric sales and consumption grew in 2011 
by only 2.1 percent compared with 9.3 percent 
in 2010. Likewise, coming from a high base 
fueled by election exhilarated outflows in 2010,
the domestic economy continued to decelerate, 
posting a 3.9 percent in 2011 from an elated 7.6 
percent growth in the previous year.
The modest increase in electricity sales and 
consumption can also be attributed to the 
cooler temperature in 2011 as compared to 
2010. The country experienced El Niño in 
first semester 2010, which triggered the high
demand for electricity. Meanwhile, the impact 
of La Niña prevailed from the latter half of 2010 
until end of first quarter of 2011 which brought
cooler temperatures. Electricity sales and 
consumption were further pulled down by the 
lower consumption of residential users partly 
as a consequence of the cooler weather for most 
of the year. The contraction was 
also due in part to base effect, 
as 2010 levels reflected higher
than the normal consumption
due to restoration efforts in the 
aftermath of Typhoon Ondoy 
and election-related activities. 
However, the subtle increase
in energy sales can be traced 
to higher consumption from 
both commercial and industrial 
sectors, which was sufficient to
offset the low performance of 
the residential sector.
The country’s total electricity 
sales for 2011 posted a minimal 
growth of 1.5 percent from
55,266 GWh in 2010 to 56,098
GWh in 2011. Meanwhile, 
“own-use” of power plants and 
distribution utilities increased 
by 15.4 percent from 4,677 GWh
in 2010 to 5,399 GWh. Technical
and non-technical losses from generation, 
transmission and distribution accounted for 
7,680 GWh or 11.1 percent. 
On a per grid basis, the Visayas grid remained the 
highest-ranked in terms of growth in electricity 
sales and consumption, representing an increase 
of 5.4 percent over the previous year. The surge
could be attributed to the stable and reliable power 
supply in the grid with the entry of additional 
installed capacities in 2010. The improved power 
supply coupled with additional infrastructure 
drew in more regional economic developments, 
which coincided with the rapid expansion of 
the industry sector in the Visayas. The notable 
performance in the revenue of industries may 
have benefitted from the commercial operations
of the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) 
in the Visayas in 2010 that spurred both local 
and foreign investments. On the other hand, 
Luzon posted a meager growth of 1.3 percent 
in electricity sales and consumption mainly due 
to the levelized or equal economic performance 
between 2010 and 2011.

consumption increased by 3.6 percent in 2011 
from 2.0 percent in 2010. The marginal growth 
came from the residential and commercial 
sectors, which accelerated to 6.7 percent and 
4.7 percent, respectively. Electricity sales in 
Mindanao sustained its year-on-year growth as 
consumption, though slow-paced, continued to 
accelerate following the restoration of power 
from the outages caused by storms experienced 
during the latter half of 2011.
Industrial Sector
Electricity sales from industrial customers was 
recorded at 19,334 GWh or 28.0 percent of 
total electricity consumption in 2011, implying 
4.1 percent growth from 18,576 GWh in 2010.
Industrial customers in Luzon registered a 
moderate increase of 2.8 percent in 2011 from 
a huge 10.9 percent in 2010, a significant
decline compared with previous year. Generally, 
however, the strong performance of the 
manufacturing sector adeptly supported by the 
sub-sectors on electronics and semiconductors, 
metal product fabrication, food products and 
beverages negated the contraction of electricity 
consumption of industrial customers in Luzon. 
On the other hand, significant increase was
observed in the Visayas grid with 9.7 percent 
from 2,770 GWh in 2010 to 3,038 GWh in 
2011. The significant growth in the industrial
customers of Visayas was supported by the 
expansion of its manufacturing subsector. 
Likewise, mining and quarrying activities grew 
at an accelerated pace compared with previous 
year due to the significant contribution of other
industry (coal).
In Mindanao, electricity sales in the industry 
sector edged up from 2,776 GWh in 2010 to 
2,902 GWh in 2011. The growth reflected the
rising demand resulting from the sustained 
growth in the manufacturing sector. 
Residential Sector
Electricity sales in the residential sector declined 
by 0.74 percent from 18,833 GWh in 2010 to 
18,694 GWh in 2011. Sales from the residential 
sector comprised 33.3 percent of the total 
electricity sales compared with 34.1 percent 
share in 2010. The decline in consumption 
of the residential customers could be partly 
attributed to base effects, as 2010 level reflected
higher-than-normal consumption among the 
residential customers.
The 2.2 percent dropped in Luzon grid sales was 
largely fuelled by the cooler weather. Further, 
almost half of the residential customers in 2011 
were lifeline subsidy customers, consuming 
100 KWh or less per month. In addition, the 
erosion of the purchasing power of households 
resulting from rising commodity, energy and 
transport prices resulted to a contraction on the 
household utilization of electronic appliances, 
food preparation and recreation.
In the Visayas, electricity sales in 2011 also 
posted a modest increase of 0.13 percent or an 
equivalent of 2,527 GWh from the previous year
level of 2,523 GWh.
On the other hand, the recovery of Mindanao 
from the impacts of El Nino in 2010 triggered 
the rise in the region’s household energy 
consumption by 6.7 percent in 2011. 
Commercial Sector
Commercial consumption increased at markedly 
lower rate from a strong growth performance 
of 10.2 percent in 2010 to a modest pace of 
2.2 percent in 2011. The sector’s demand can 
be attributed to business process outsourcing, 
hotels and restaurants, wholesale and smallscale trade and retail establishments, and 
import and export trading.
Generally, the increased electricity sales was 
mainly due to the accelerated growth of real 
estate, renting and business activities engaged 
in transport, storage and communication, and 
the recovery of the trading activities towards 
the end of the year. Further, the continued 
demand for services such as for laundry, medical 
and health, education, hotels and restaurants, 
beauty and wellness justified the constant
though restrained growth of electricity sales in 
the commercial sector.
Others
Others refer to public buildings, street lights, 
irrigation and “others not elsewhere classified.”
This group recorded a remarkable decline of 
9.4 percent from its 1,596 GWh consumption
in 2010 to 1,446 GWh in 2011 as a result of the 
government’s under spending on infrastructure 
such as public buildings. The slowdown in the 
activities of farmers and fisher folks in the
agriculture sector due to the reduced production 
of main crops such as palay, corn and other 
crops; and, fishing caused by the extreme
weather conditions and high cost of fuel also 
contributed to the said decrease in this sector.
OWN-USE AND SYSTEM LOSS
Total percentage share of system loss posted a 
modest diminution of 1.6 percent from 7,800 
GWh in 2010 to 7,680 GWh in 2011. The slight 
decrease was a result of improved performance 
of transmission and distribution systems 
due to continuous enhancement in network 
efficiency and improved pilferage management.
Moreover, national government initiatives such 
as the sustained energy efficiency improvement
programs, operations and management 
practices were other relevant factors and 
intervention that contributed to the system loss 
reduction in 2011.
Meanwhile, utilities’ own-use for office and
station use of the power plants sustained its 
vigorous performance, standing an aggressive 
double-digit rise at 15.4 percent from 4,677
GWh in 2010 to 5,398 GWh in 2011. The growth
came mainly from the increasing working capital 
particularly to the bulk demand coming from 
the additional electronic durable equipment 
related to the improvements and expansions of 
the utilities.
SYSTEM PEAK DEMAND
Luzon grid’s system peak demand for 2011 was 
recorded at 7,632 MW, 3.0 percent lower than 
the 7,865 MW level in 2010. The slight decrease
could be attributed to the cooler temperature 
due to the inception of La Nina in the latter part 
of 2011. 
In the Visayas, coincident peak demand which 
occurred in December 2011 reached 1,481 MW, 
higher by about 3.5 percent compared with the
previous year’s level of 1,431 MW on the same 
month. At the sub-grid level, Cebu reflected the
highest average demand for 2011 with 49.0 
percent share. This was followed by Panay at 
17.6 percent; Negros at 16.6 percent; LeyteSamar at 14.1 percent; and Bohol at 4.3 percent. 
The lowest recorded system demand in the grid 
was on 25 December 2011 (Christmas Day) with
1,202 MW.
Meanwhile, in Mindanao, the recorded peak 
demand occurred in December 2011 at 1,347 
MW, which was 4.5 percent higher than the
2010 actual coincident peak of 1,289 MW. 
Similarly, the lowest recorded demand was 
during Christmas Day with 996 MW.
A suppressed demand was observed throughout 
the Mindanao grid in view of the continued 
deficiency of available supply to meet the
increasing demand for power in the island. 
In line with this, the government and private 
sector jointly initiated mitigating measures to 
avert the worsening power scenario. These

On the overall, the country recorded an aggregate 
peak demand from three (3) grids at 10,460 MW 
in 2011, which was lower by 1.2 percent from 
previous year’s level of 10,585 MW. In the first half
of 2012, the country’s system peak demand was 
registered at 10,467 MW – Luzon at 7,889 MW, 
Visayas at 1,449 MW and Mindanao at 1,309 MW. 
DEMAND-SUPPLY OUTLOOK
ENERGY AND PEAK DEMAND FORECAST
Electricity demand is the amount of electricity 
being consumed at any given time. It also 
indicates the minimum required capacity and 
production in terms of watt (w) and watthour (Wh), respectively. One approach, among 
others to manage electricity demand is to build 
additional generation facilities that can be 
brought online to manage peaks including the 
reserve requirements. 
Considering the actual performance against the 
forecasted level of the power sector (generation 
and consumption) in 2011, the energy sales 
and peak demand forecasts for the 2012 Power 
Development Plan (PDP) are comparatively 
lower. 
The energy and demand forecasts for the 
Luzon grid is more comprehensive compared 
to Visayas and Mindanao grids as it comprised 
about 74.0 percent of the nationwide demand 
vis-à-vis its contribution to the major economic 
structural changes, being the center of industry 
and commerce. 
DEMAND FORECASTING METHODOLOGY 
AND ASSUMPTIONS
Following are the steps in coming up with the 
peak demand forecasts for the major grids. 
1. Determine the Energy Sales Forecasts
The growth rates in the energy purchase of DUs 
on the bases of their consolidated 2012-2020 
DDPs were used to come up with the energy sales 
forecast. The growth rates are applied to the 
actual data of the reference year for each grid, 
which in this case is 2011. From the baseline 
energy sales data, the non-utility58 sales from 
the Power Delivery Services (PDS) data sourced 
from the system operations of the transmission 
company are added to come up with the total 
electricity sales forecast. 
2. Convert energy sales forecasts to peak 
demand forecasts
The peak demand forecasts for each grid 
are derived using the load factor approach. 
Embedded generation not captured by the 
System Operator is added. 
From the forecasted energy sales that have 
been established above, the station use and 
transmission losses (SU/TL) are then added to 
come up with the gross generation. These figures
are converted to peak demand in MW using 
the assumed load factor for each grid based on 
historical performance. For 2012, the actual SU/
TL of 10.4 percent (Luzon), 7.1 percent (Visayas) 
and 9.6 percent (Mindanao) were used.
Meanwhile, the load factor assumptions for the 
planning horizon are: 73.0 percent for Luzon; 
69.0 percent for Visayas and 72.0 percent for 
Mindanao. 
RESULTING ELECTRICITY SALES AND 
PEAK DEMAND FORECASTS, 2012-2030
The country’s electricity sales59 are projected 
to increase from 63.1 TWh in 2012 to 85.4 TWh
by 2020, up to 106.0 in 2025 TWh and 131.8
by 2030. Peak demand is likewise projected to 
increase from 10.9 GW in 2012 to 15.0 GW by
2020, 18.6 GW by 2025, and about 23.2 GW by
2030.
58 Refers to directly-connected customers of NPC and NGCP.
59 Electricity sales plus DUs ownuse and losses
Luzon
Luzon grid is expected to double its peak 
demand and electricity sales towards the end of 
the planning period. Electricity sales will grow 
from 45.1 TWh in 2011 to 61.2 TWh in 2020,
76.0 TWh in 2025 and 94.3 TWh in 2030. The
corresponding peak demand of 7.6 GW in 2011 
is projected to reach 10.7 GW in 2020. Based on 
the average growth rates indicated in Table 42, 
this is expected to further move up to 16.5 GW
by 2030.
Visayas
Visayas electricity sales and peak demand are 
expected to grow much faster than Luzon as 
shown in Table 43. The grid’s electricity sales of 
9.0 TWh in 2011 is expected to increase to 12.4 
TWh in 2020, 15.3 TWh in 2025, and will reach
19.0 TWh in 2030. Correspondingly, the peak 
demand will expand from 1.5 GW in 2011 to 2.2
GW by 2020, and increase to 3.4 GW by 
2030. 
Mindanao
Mindanao’s actual electricity sales for 2011 
reached 7.7 TWh. This is expected to expand to 
11.8 TWh in 2020, and will further reach 14.8 
TWh in 2025 and 18.5 TWh in 2030 (Table 43).
Peak demand is also expected to reach 2.1 GW in 
2020 and 3.3 GW in 2030.
Measurable Sectoral Targets
In power development planning, identificationof
additional capacity is dependent on the following 
factors: electricity demand projections, required 
reserve margin needed in the system, and the 
schedule retirement of existing capacity. Over 
the planning horizon, around 13,166.7 MW of 
new capacities are needed to meet the demand 
and reserve requirements for electrical power. 
Of these, 1,766.7 MW of additional capacities 
are already committed power projects (Table 
45), while the remaining 11,400 MW are still
open for private sector investments.
COMMITTED POWER PROJECTS
As of mid-2012, private sector-initiated 
committed power projects totaled 1,766.7 MW. 
In Luzon, the 868.7 MW committed capacities 
include: (i) 21-MW CIP 2 Bunker Fired-Plant 
diesel-fired plant in La Union; (ii) 13-MW Green
Future Biomass project in Isabela; (iii) 135-MW

SUPPLY-DEMAND OUTLOOK
Reference Scenario
The economic assumptions underlying the 
reference scenario and its derivatives are in 
the category of “business-as-usual.” Additional 
capacities are needed on top of the committed 
capacities to meet the increasing electricity 
requirement of the country broken down into 
the following grid requirements: (i) 71.1 percent 
or 8,100 MW for Luzon; (ii) 14.9 percent or 
1,700 MW for Visayas ; and, (iii) 14.0 percent or 
1,600 MW for Mindanao as shown in Table 45.
Luzon Grid
In this year’s PDP update, Luzon grid is expected 
to grow at an average annual growth rate (AAGR) 
of 4.1 percent based on DDPs of distribution 
utilities. Existing capacity is expected to increase 
from 10,744 MW60 in 2011 to 11,763 MW by 
2030 considering the following assumptions: 
(i) committed capacities will be onstream as 
scheduled; (ii) rehabilitation and uprating of 
130-MW Bacman Geothermal will be completed 
by 2013; (iii) 20-MW Binga Uprating will be 
completed at a phase of 5 MW per year starting in
2012 until 2015; (iv) there will be normal hydro
condition; (v) no retirement for existing power 
plants; (vi) reserve margin will be maintained at 
4.0 percent of peak demand and 647 MW each 
for contingency and dispatchable reserve. 
Considering the scheduled maintenance 
activities and outages of existing power plants, 
Luzon grid needs additional capacity every year 
to augment the system’s required demand and 
reserve margin starting 2016. Of the 8,100 MW 
needed capacities, 74.1 percent and 25.9 percent

Visayas Grid
Visayas grid has a slightly higher growth rate 
at 4.5 percent AAGR compared to Luzon grid in
terms of the demand projections. With the full 
commercialization of the 610-MW coal-fired
facilities in 2011– the 164-MW Panay Energy 
Development Coal-fired plant, the 246-MW
Cebu Energy Development Coal-fired Plant,
and the 200-MW KEPCO Salcon Coal-fired
plant – the grid will have enough capacity until 
2015. By 2016, Visayas will start to require
an additional 50 MW to augment the required
reserve margin of the system considering the 
scheduled maintenance activities and outages 
of existing power plants. A total of 1,700 MW 
new capacities are needed to meet the projected

demand and the required reserve margin until 
2030. Of these, 76.5 percent should come from
baseload plants, while remaining 23.5 percent
from peaking plants63. This is on the same 
assumption that (i) all committed capacities 
will come onstream as scheduled; (ii) there will 
be normal hydro conditions; (iii) no retirement 
for existing power plants; (iv) reserve margin 
will be maintained at 4.0 percent of peak 
demand and 100 MW each for contingency and 
dispatchable reserve.
Mindanao Grid
Mindanao grid, which is highly dependent on 
hydropower generation, sourced around 50.0
percent of electricity supply from Agus and 
Pulangui hydro plants. At 4.8 AAGR, a total of 
1,100 MW baseload plants and 500 MW peaking
plants on top of 588 MW committed capacity
are needed to meet the projected demand and 
reserve margin requirements. 
63 Peaking plants can be started up relatively quickly and 
expensive to operate relative to the amount of power they 
produce
Among the three grids, Mindanao would 
immediately need 150 MW and 50 MW peaking
plants by 2012 and 2013, respectively, to 
alleviate the supply problem in the grid, as

maintenance and outages of power plants.
The same set of assumptions have been 
considered for the supply requirement of the 
grid with reserve margin equivalent to 4.0 peak 
demand and 105 MW each for contingency and
dispatchable reserve. 
REQUIRED RESERVE MARGIN
In the previous PDP, the DOE applied a required 
reserve margin or ancillary services of 23.4 
percent (2.8 percent Frequency Regulation 
Reserve, 10.3 percent Contingency Reserve, 
and 10.3 percent Dispatchable Reserve) for 
Luzon and Visayas grids, and 21.0 percent 
(2.8 percent Frequency Regulation Reserve, 9.1 
percent Contingency Reserve, and 9.1 percent 
Dispatchable Reserve) for Mindanao grid on top 
of the peak demand.
With the approval of the 2011-2015 final
determination of the NGCP by the Energy 
Regulatory Commission (ERC), the required 
level of ancillary services to be provided on 
each grid are specified in Section 3.3 of the draft
Ancillary Service Procurement Plan. These are 
as follows:
• Frequency Regulation Reserve (FRR) 
available should be at a level equivalent to 
4.0 percent of peak demand for each grid.
• Contingency Reserve (CR) available on each 
grid should be equal to the total scheduled 
unit load and unit reserve level of the most 
heavily loaded generator. 
• Dispatchable Reserve (DR) available must 
be equal to the scheduled load and reserve 
of the second most heavily loaded scheduled 
generator on each grid. Where the two 
highest loaded generators on each grid have 
the same scheduled loading and reserve, the 
contingency reserve requirement will be 
equal to the dispatchable reserve.
The DOE adopted these ancillary services in 
coming up with the required reserve margin in 
the 2011 PDP. Each grid should have a level of 
FRR equal to 4.0 percent of the forecast demand 
on that grid. While for CR and DR, each reserve 
is equal to the largest generating single unit or 
a power import from a single grid. For Luzon 
grid, the largest single unit is the 647-MW Sual 
Power Plant. In Visayas grid, the largest single 
unit is the 100-MW Kepco-Salcon Coal-fired
Power plant, while in Mindanao grid, the largest 
single unit is the 105-MW Mindanao Coal-fired
Power plant.
Development Challenges
Luzon Grid
Power supply in the grid was more reliable in 
2011 compared with 2010 with the GOMP in 
place. Luzon did not experience brownouts 
due to shortfall in power generation, but only 
during emergency situations caused by natural 
calamities such as typhoons, landslides etc. 
Forced outages or unplanned shutdowns were 
minimized since the generating companies 
adhered to the scheduled maintenance of their 
facilities. However there are still challenges to
ensure the grid’s reliability of supply:
1. Need to intensify the IEC on the use of 
different technologies for power generation.
2. Inform the public of the power situation 
as well as the demand and supply outlook, 
including the available options to mitigate 
power supply shortage. 
Visayas Grid
The power situation in the Visayas grid relatively 
improved in 2011 due to the addition of the 610 
MW coal-fired power plants. However, for the
2012 PDP, the grid will require an additional 
50 MW by 2016 and another 50 MW by 2018
because of increasing demand. Investors should 
look into the ideal place/location to put up 
power plants identified based on the latest
TDP to sustain and/or improve the limited 
generating capacity in the area.
Mindanao Grid
Brownouts in the region were reduced with 
the improved GOMP, as well as the issuance of 
D. C. 2010-10-001164 and D.C. 2012-03-000465. 
However,theurgentneedto address the following
issues is foreseen to solve the supply situation: 
1. Need to put up additional baseload capacity 
to ensure supply security in the event of El 
Nino Phenomenon. Insufficient baseload
capacity will result in high electricity rates 
since expensive plants will be required to 
run during peak; 
2. Government need to reach a decision on the 
privatization of the remaining NPC assets, 
such as Agus-Pulangui through the Joint 
Congressional Power Commission (JCPC). 
3. Implementation of the Interim Mindanao 
Electricity Market (IMEM) to address 
deficiency of supply in the grid. The IMEM
is a mandatory program which provides all 
generators, directly-connected customers, 
and distribution utilities wherein an assured 
platform to trade their excess power. 
For the Entire Grid 
1. Need to review the pricing structure of 
natural gas and geothermal steam which are 
indexed to prices of oil and coal, respectively. 
The indexation makes the prices of 
electricity generated from natural gas and 
geothermal steam higher and vulnerable to 
price fluctuations in the world market for oil
and coal.
64 Mandating the rational utilization of available generation 
capacity in Mindanao and directing the DOE and its attached 
agencies, the NGCP, and all industry stakeholders to address the 
power supply situation in the region
65 Directing compliance with the EPIRA of 2001 to address the 
power supply situation, including the rationalization of the 
available capacities in the Mindanao Grid
2. Limited experience of ECs in securing power 
supply contracts other than from NPC. ECs 
can enter into power supply agreement with 
private generation companies to ensure 
sufficient supply of electricity to their
customers. Although they can buy through 
the WESM, exposure to volatility of price is 
probable. 
3. Continuously work on the policies to help 
attract private capital in power generation. 
There is a need to harmonize the procedures 
in obtaining permits and licenses, such as 
Service/Operating Contracts, Clearance to 
undertake Grid Impact Study, Connection 
Agreement with NGCP, and endorsement to 
the Board of Investment.
4. Implementation of RE pricing mechanism. 
RE developers on wind and solar power 
generation projects are awaiting the 
implementation of approved FiT66 rates 
prior to the finalization of their projects.
Plans and Programs 
To deal with the challenges and ensure reliable 
and sustainable electricity supply for the country, 
the following initiatives shall be undertaken:
1. Establish partnerships and regular dialogue 
with key stakeholders such as electric 
power industry participants, LGUs and the 
Chamber of Commerce and Industries to 
facilitate policy implementation and project 
development;
2. Reduce capacity gap through timely 
implementation of power generation 
projects, particularly the committed projects. 
Strictly implement the ideal locations/areas 
identified in the TDP;
3. Formulate island grid-based energy plan, 
including power development plan to 
address specific developmental concerns;
66 Initial Fit rates were approved on 27 July 20124. Update the Power Supply Contingency Plan 
to put in place immediate measures in the 
event of imminent power supply shortage;
5.	 Promote efficient use of electricity through
demand-side management (DSM) by 
developing policy framework for power 
generation projects and the participation 
of embedded generators of electric 
cooperatives in SPUG areas;
6. Improve heat rate of power plants as an 
alternative way to increase availability;
7. Establish and strictly monitor industry 
compliance to reliability standards by 
monitoring and disclosures on status of 
generating facilities; 
8. Facilitate, through NEA the securing of 
power supply contracts of ECs with private 
GenCos; 
9.	 Pursue energy efficiency and conservation
programs in commercial, industrial and 
household sectors to reduce electricity 
consumption that would result in deferred 
power capacity addition; and,
10. Provide interim policy on the privatization 
of remaining NPC assets for contingency 
purposes. 
Since the Mindanao grid has been experiencing 
critical power supply, it necessitates the 
implementation of specific measures deemed
necessary to reduce and resolve such, as follows:
11. Develop Mindanao Energy Plan with focus on 
power incorporating comments, suggestions 
of the Mindanao stakeholders derived from 
the conduct of meetings and consultations; 
12. Study the appropriate electricity model for 
Mindanao for the establishment of modified
WESM in the region;
13. Revisit the economic viability of the VisayasMindanao interconnection project. The ERC 
has already approved NGCP‘s application 
to conduct a feasibility study for the said 
interconnection project which involves two 
options: Option 1 is the Leyte-Mindanao 
Interconnection, and Option 2 is the NegrosZamboanga Interconnection; 
14. Dredge and clear obstruction of AgusPulangui IV river system to improve water 
levels for the hydro plants;
15.	Rehabilitate Power Barge (PB) 104 to
upgrade its de-rated capacity and further 
extend its economic life. Said rehabilitation 
will be undertaken once transferred to the 
winning bidder; 
16.	Uprate Agus VI HEP Units 1 and 2 to increase
their generating capacities and extend the 
units’ economic life to another 30 years;
17. Transfer of PBs 101, 102 and 103 – from 
Visayas to Mindanao to augment capacity of 
the grid. The cost and transfer of the PBs 
will be borne by the winning bidder; 
18. Operate the Iligan Diesel Power Plant once 
the resolution on the issue of its sale has 
been reached with the Commission on 
Audit.; 
19.	Defer the sale of Agus and Pulangi Hydro
Power Plants and revisit/review the 
privatization plan, particularly on the 
hydroelectric facilities; and,
20. Utilize the embedded generation of the DUs 
to augment existing supply capacities. 
Transmission Development Plan 
As mandated by RA 9136 or the Electric Power 
IndustryReformAct of2001(EPIRAandRA9511
or “An Act Granting the National Grid Corporation 
of the Philippines (NGCP) a Franchise to Engage 
in the Business of Conveying or Transmitting 
Electricity through High Voltage Back-bone
system of Interconnected Transmission Lines, 
Substations and Related Facilities, and for 
other Purpose,” the NGCP is responsible for the 
formulation of the Transmission Development 
Plan (TDP) in consultation with the electric 
power industry players. 
For the 2012 TDP Update67, the NGCP is 
committed to adhere to its overarching goal 
of providing steady and sustainable growth of 
its power networks with focus on major grid 
expansions and interconnections, renewable 
energy development, and the Mindanao power 
situation. 
The major grid interconnections are for 
the augmentation and strengthening of 
transmission capacity to support a unified grid.
Among those projects are the Batangas-Mindoro 
Interconnection (submitted for approval of 
the Energy Regulatory Commission or ERC), 
Leyte-Mindanao Interconnection (currently 
undergoing feasibility study), and the CebuNegros-Panay Interconnection, which is the 
extension of the 230 kV transmission backbone 
of the Visayas Grid all the way to Panay. 
Renewable energy represents a new 
development that needs to be considered in the 
2012 TDP. With the promulgation of FIT rates 
by ERC, the bulk entry of RE plants in the coming 
years is already anticipated. Thus, adequate 
transmission facilities should be provided to 
cater to huge RE power generation potentials in 
the region. Looping in Northern Luzon is being 
proposed to accommodate the wind farms’ entry 
into the Luzon Grid.
67 2012 TDP Update is formulated by NGCP
As for the Mindanao Grid, the objective is to 
accelerate the completion of projects to address 
the region’s power situation and strengthen 
the existing transmission system to ensure 
the stability, efficiency and reliability of power
transmission in the entire grid. 
Following are the planning and programming 
objectives considered in the TDP update: 
• Building of the strongest power grid in 
Southeast Asia; 
• Development of a unified national grid
capable of transmitting reliable power 
across the country; 
• Compliance with the Grid Code and the 
requirements of competitive retail electricity 
market; 
• Accommodation of all the power plants 
approved by the DOE in its Power 
Development Program; 
• Compliance with mandates under R.A. 
9513 or Renewable Energy Act of 2008, in
particular to provide priority connection to 
renewable energy-based plants;
• Identification and recommendation of
ideal connection points for new power 
plants, which will require no major grid 
reinforcement; 
• Upgrade of aging transmission and subtransmission facilities, including primary, 
secondary and protection equipment; 
• Application of “smart grid” technology in 
new transmission facilities and SCADA 
system; and, 
• Gradual improvement of the 
telecommunication network. GRID PROFILE
In Luzon Grid, the bulk generation sources are 
located in the northern and southern parts 
of the island while the load center is in Metro 
Manila, which accounts for about 70.0 percent 
of the total grid load. Because of this system 
configuration, the transmission backbone must
have capability to transfer large amount of 
power from both the north and south. 
Northern Transmission Corridor
The northern transmission corridor consists 
of several flow paths to transfer power from
the sites located in the north to Metro Manila. 
The main path is the 500kV double-circuit
transmission line (TL) from Bolo to Nagsaag 
in Pangasinan then to San Jose in Bulacan. The 
Bolo and Nagsaag extra high voltage (EHV)
substations are the receiving ends of generation 
from the north. The received power is then 
delivered to Metro Manila mainly via Mexico in 
Pampanga and San Jose Substations in Bulacan. 
Southern Transmission Corridor
The southern portion of the 500 kV transmission
backbone stretches from Naga in Bicol area 
to Tayabas, Quezon. However, this 500 kV
backbone segment is currently energized at 230 
kV voltage level. The Naga Substation is also the 
termination point for the High Voltage Direct
Current (HVDC) system that could allow the
exchange of up to 440 MW of power between 
Luzon and the Visayas Grids.
Metro Manila Transmission Configuration
In Metro Manila, the major 230 kV substations 
are Quezon (along Balintawak), Taytay (Rizal), 
Doña Imelda (along Araneta), Muntinlupa, Las 
Piñas and Marilao (Bulacan). At present, there 
are two (2) main load sectors within Metro 
Manila: Sector 1 consists of Quezon, Doña Imelda 
and Marilao; and Sector 2 consists of Taytay, 
Muntinlupa and Las Piñas 230 kV substations. 
Visayas Transmission System
The Visayas transmission system can be divided 
into five (5) different sub-grids, namely: Panay,
Negros, Cebu, Bohol and Leyte-Samar. Taking into 
consideration the load flow from east to west (or
vice versa) of the Visayas Grid, the transmission 
backbone of the grid extends from the far east, at 
the Allen Cable Terminal Station (CTS) in Samar, 
all the way to Nabas substation in Panay, in the far 
west. This route is comprised of approximately 
895 kilometers of transmission line. It is
composed of HVDC line, overhead transmission
lines and submarine cables. 
The bulk of installed generation capacity in the 
Visayas is located in Leyte and Cebu with the 
entry of the 246-MW CEDC and 200- MW Korean 
Electric Company Coal Fired Power Plants (CFPP). 
These additional capacity changed the load flow
in the Visayas Grid as Cebu is now able to serve its 
demand rather than importing power from the 
Leyte steam fields. Ongoing projects in Calungcalung-Toledo-Colon-Cebu 138 kV transmission 
line are being implemented to fully accommodate 
the CEDC CFPP. Cebu also exports power to 
Negros, which lacks inland generating plants 
Leyte remains the power supplier to Samar 
and Bohol through the single-circuit OrmocBabatngon and Ormoc-Maasin 138 kV lines, 
respectively. Any outage of the said lines 
may result in power cut-off in the affected 
island. Thus, N-168 projects of the said lines are 
currently ongoing. 
68 N-1 is defined as a single outage contingency criterion. This 
criterion specifies that the Grid shall continue to operate in 
the normal state following the loss of one generating unit, 
transmission lineor transformer

With the entry of the 164-MW PEDC 
CFPP, Panay became less reliant 
on imported power via the 138-kV 
Negros-Panay Interconnection System 
and, at certain times, is also able to 
export power to Negros.
Mindanao Transmission System
The Mindanao Grid power system is 
vulnerable to power outage especially 
during long dry season due to its 
reliance on hydropower plants. This 
was experienced in early 2010 when 
the El Niño phenomenon drastically 
reduced the main hydropower sources 
in the island. 
Despite the aforementioned 
susceptibility of the power sources, 
the grid is still considered a highly 
reliable transmission system having 
three (3) segments complementing 
each other in transmitting power from 
north to south. These are the Agus 
2-Kibawe 138 kV double circuit (DC) 
transmission line in Iligan, the BaloiTagoloan-Maramag-Kibawe-Davao 138 
kV DC transmission line in Bukidnon, 
and the soon to be completed BaloiVillanueva-Maramag-Bunawan 230 kV 
DC transmission line also in Bukidnon.
IDEAL LOCATIONS OF POWER 
PLANTS
Developing power generating plants 
within load center is actually ideal 
in order to reduce power imports. 
However, environmental concerns,
area congestion, and high cost of 
realty would make the implementation 
difficult. Therefore, to minimize costs,
avert line congestion, maximize existing 
transmission network capacity and 
guide upcoming generating companies 
in choosing their prospective plant 
locations, the 2012 TDP update contains 
an indicative list of ideal locations of power plants for the 
three major grids as seen in Figures 47-49. 
To serve as a guide for generation investors, TDP likewise

during	   long	   dry	   season	   due	   to	   its	  
reliance	   on	   hydropower	   plants.	   This	  
was	   experienced	   in	   early	   2010	   when

transmission reinforcement. These recommended 
connection points are based on the capacity of the 
substation for the years 201169, 201570 and 202071. 
Development Challenges 
The major challenge is the management of 
transmission congestion primarily due to the 
problem in acquiring right-of-way for the new 
transmission lines and space limitations in existing 
substations. Such is more evident in Metro Manila, 
which is highly urbanized and geographically 
unique as the land area between the Manila Bay 
and Laguna Lake, is relatively narrow. 
In the Visayas, more indicative power plants are 
proposed to be located outside the major load 
centers. Majority will be in Panay Island as listed 
in the 2012 Power Development Plan, which is 
about 278 MW for committed projects and 233 
MW for indicative projects. This will result in 
excess capacity inasmuch as Panay Island has a 
system peak demand of around 260 MW in 2011 
and 248 MW in June 2012. The excess capacity 
cannot be transmitted to Negros Island due to the 
limited capacity of the existing submarine cable 
link. Thus, the Cebu-Negros-Panay (CNP) 230 kV 
Backbone Project is being proposed which may 
be implemented in the Third Regulatory Period.
Considering the sizeable capital expenditures 
involved in the upgrading of submarine cable 
interconnections, the NGCP sees the need to 
identify the locations of proposed capacity 
additions to maintain the supply-demand balance 
in each grid. This is critical in deciding whether 
or not a transmission solution, which entails 
upgrading the submarine cable interconnections 
to fully allow import and export of power between 
islands, is more feasible to pursue.
In Mindanao, the main problem is the deficiency
in generation. Unless new power plants come into 
the grid, the island will continue to experience 
power shortage especially during long dry season.

There is also a need for an established technical 
and regulatory framework to ensure reliable and 
efficient transmission. In doing so, the sector
needs to overcome the following challenges to 
accomplish its objectives: 
1.	 Need for a unified national transmission
network capable of supporting a unified grid
which is compliant to N-1 criterion and the 
competitive retail electricity market system. 
2. Need for additional primary and secondary 
system reinforcements capable of addressing 
the aggressive timeline of new power plants, 
particularly RE. 
3. Need to upgrade old and defective equipment 
and facilities, such as primary and secondary 
equipment, protection, telecommunication. 
4. Need to expand sub-transmission facilities 
and upgrade old and heavily-loaded 69 kV 
lines, which have not been divested and are 
the subject of various ERC Resolutions.
5.	 Need to identify alternative transmission
corridors, as transmission facilities such as 
lines and drawdown substations in urban 
areas are becoming inadequate. 
Plans and Programs
Pursuant to its mandate under RA 9511, and
responsibilities under EPIRA and RE Act s well as 
other rules and issuances, the 2012 TDP should 
be responsive to the promotion and development 
of the needed generation capacities nationwide 
to meet the future demand for electricity and 
spur competition in the generation and supply 
sector. In collaboration with the DOE, the 2012 
TDP shall ensure the absorptive capacity of the 
grid and the provision of adequate and ancillary 
services needed by the system including 
the attendant requirements for generating 
capacities, among others, that will come online 
within the next few years. 
For Luzon, within the 2011-2015 period, major
developments in the 230 kV system are expected 
to take place including the:
• Ambuklao-Binga 239 kV Transmission Line 
Upgrading in Benguet. This project aims 
to upgrade the existing line in order to 
maintain the N-1 contingency taking into 
consideration the repowering of Ambuklao 
HEP to a new capacity of 105 MW and also
the proposed expansion of Magat HEP (180
MW additional capacity). Thus, during the
maximum generation of both power plants, 
this project will resolve the overloading 
under N-1 contingency condition, i.e, outage 
of one 230 kV circuit. 
• Binga-San Manuel 230 kV Transmission Line 
project involves the construction of a new 
40 km DC 230 kV transmission line using 
new right–of-way. The project also includes 
the installation of switching facilities in 
Binga in Benguet Province and San Manuel 
Substations in Pangasinan. The project 
aims to provide N-1 contingency during 
maximum dispatch of the generating plants, 
particularly HEPs in North Luzon.
• Capacity expansion for Dasmariñas EHV
Substation in Cavite in order to continuously 
meet the N-1 criterion even during prolonged 
outage of one transformer unit. 
For the Visayas, several transmission backbone 
projects are approved by ERC to include: 
• The Bohol Backbone Transmission project, 
which is expected to be completed by 2013. 
The Ubay-Corella 138 kV line is necessary to 
prevent the overloading of Ubay-Trinidad 69 
kV line during outage of Ubay-Alicia 69 kV line 
segment, and vice versa. On the other hand, 
the new substation in Corella, which is near 
the load center in Tabilaran City, will provide 
a new bulk power delivery point in Bohol 
and help reduce the load of Ubay Substation. 
The specific location of the Bohol Backbone
Transmission project is shown in Figure 50. 
• The Southern Panay Backbone transmission 
project, which is part of the Panay Power 
Transmission Backbone involves the 
installation/construction of a total of 97 
kilometers of 138 kV and 69 kV overhead 
transmission line utilizing steel tower 
structures. The new transmission backbone 
will accommodate load growth and address 
the low voltage in southern Panay. In 
particular, the new facilities will avert the 
overloading of the Sta. Barbara-Sibalom 69 
kV transmission line and the Sta. Barbara 
Substation in Dingle, Panay Province.
For Mindanao, six (6) major transmission 
projects have been approved by the ERC for 
implementation from 2012-2014, to include:
• The Aurora-Polanco Transmission Project, 
which is intended to serve the growing power 
demand of Dipolog and neighboring load 
centers, such as Dapitan City. This project 
includes the construction of the Polanco 
Substation, that will ensure continuous and 
reliable power supply in the Zamboanga del 
Norte area;
• The Butuan-Placer Transmission Project, 
which is part of the Reliability Compliance 
Project I in Mindanao. The project involves 
the installation of the second circuit of the 
existing Butuan-Placer 138 kV corridor that 
will provide N-1 contingency to the existing 
line and reduce transmission loss to further 
lines,	  which	  have	  not	  been	  divested	  and	  are	  
the	  subject	  of	  various	  ERC	  Resolutions;	  and,

corridors, as	   transmission	   facilities	   such	   as	  
lines	   and	   drawdown	   substations	   in	   urban	  
areas	  are	  becoming	  inadequate.	  
Plans  and  Programs
Pursuant	   to	   its	   mandate	   under	   RA	   9511,	   and	  	  
responsibilities	  under	  EPIRA	  and	  RE	  Act s	  well	  as	  
other	   rules	   and	   issuances,	   the	   2012 TDP	   should	  
be	   responsive	   to	   the	   promotion	   and	  
development	   of	   the	   needed	   generation	  
capacities	   nationwide	   to	   meet	   the	   future	  
demand	   for	   electricity	   and	   	   spur	   competition	   in	  
the	   generation	   and	   supply	   sector.	   In	  
collaboration	   with	  the	   DOE,	  the	   2012 TDP	   shall	  
ensure	   the	   absorptive	   capacity	   of	   the	   grid	   and	  
the	   provision	   of	   adequate	   and	   ancillary	   services	  
needed	   by	   the	   system	   including	   the	   attendant	  
requirements	   for	   generating	   capacities,	   among	  
others,	  that	  will	  come	  online	  within	  the	  next	  few	  
years.	  
For	   Luzon,	   within	   the	   2011-­‐2015	   period,	   major	  
developments	  in	  the	  230 kV	  system	  are	  expected	  
to	  take	  place	  including	  the:
� Ambuklao-­‐Binga	   239kV	   Transmission	   Line	  
Upgrading in	   Benguet. This	   project	   aims	   to	  
upgrade the	  existing	   line	   in	   order	   to	  maintain	  
the	   N-­‐1	   contingency	   taking	   into	   consideration	  
the	   repowering	   of	   Ambuklao	   HEP	   to	   a	   new	  
capacity	   of	   105	   MW	   and	   also	   the	   proposed	  
expansion	   of	   Magat	   HEP	   (180	   MW	   additional	  
capacity).	   Thus,	   during	   the	   maximum	  
generation	   of	   both	   power	   plants,	   this	   project	  
will	   resolve	   the	   overloading	   under	   N-­‐1

right–of-­‐way.	   	   The	   project	   also	   includes	   the	  
installation	   of	   switching	   facilities	   in Binga in	  
Benguet	  Province and	  San	  Manuel	  Substations
in	  Pangasinan.	  The	  project	  aims	  to	  provide	  N-­‐1	  
contingency	   during	   maximum	   dispatch	   of	   the	  
generating	   plants,	   particularly	   HEPs	   in	   North

existing 138 kV double circuit MaramagKibawe transmission line in Bukidnon. In 
addition, the project is also intended to 
relieve the Maramag-Kibawe 138 kV line 
from overloading due to the frequent 
outage of the Agus 2- Kibawe 138 kV line. 
The project also includes the expansion of 
Maramag and Kibawe Substations.
Interconnection Projects
In view of the increasing power demand in each 
island grid, the NGCP is bound to interconnect 
the major island grids. For Luzon, the BatangasMindoro interconnection aims to develop a 230 
kV interconnection facility between the main 
grid Luzon and the power grid in the island of 
Mindoro. This will give Mindoro Island an access 
to a more stable and reliable source of electricity 
from the main Luzon grid. 
For Visayas, the Leyte-Bohol Interconnection 2nd
Circuit which is included in the list of indicative 
projects, is expected to stabilize supply/demand 
requirements. In addition, the overhead 
transmission backbone must be reinforced 
and even upgraded to higher voltage. These 
upratings are necessary to meet load growth 
and accommodate increased power transfer 
between the islands. 
The Cebu-Negros-Panay 230kV Backbone project 
which is in the list of new project for the 3rd
Regulatory Period involves the extension of the 
230 kV transmission backbone, presently only up 
to Cebu, all the way to Panay, in order to optimize 
and fully utilize generation capacities all over 
the Visayas grid. As this project will require huge 
CAPEX, the project will be implemented in stages 
to minimize rate impact. Stage 1, which will 
involve the installation of the second submarine 
cable between Negros and Panay, as well as the 
overhead line from E.B. Magalona CTS in Negros 
to Bacolod Substation, is already considered 
for accelerated implementation by NGCP. These 
facilities will be initially energized at 138 kV and 
are targeted to be completed in time for the 
commissioning of the first unit of Concepcion
Coal with a capacity of 135 MW by 2015.
The other stages will be for later implementation. 
This will be mainly triggered by generation 
developments in Panay and Toledo City.
For Mindanao, the Leyte - Mindanao 
Interconnection Project is divided into two phases. 
Phase 1 involves the conduct of feasibility study 
on the economic viability of the project. The result 
of the feasibility study will be used as basis for the 
final configuration of the interconnection project.
The feasibility study is expected to be completed 
within 2013. On 15 August 2011, ERC already
granted NGCP with Provisional Authority (PA) to 
proceed with the implementation of Phase 1. 
Phase 2 of the project is the linking of the Visayas 
and Mindanao Grids. The interconnection is 
expected to optimize Mindanao’s hydropower 
plant operation, increase the reliability of the 
Mindanao Power System, reduce frequency 
regulation reserves and make exchange of 
energy during periods of shortfall or surplus in 
power supply possible. 
The creation of a unified Philippine Grid would
create a more open, liberalized and competitive 
market since Mindanao-based industry players 
can participate freely in the WESM in the future. 
It will open up more investment opportunities 
in Mindanao, both in terms of additional power 
generation and industrial loads due to a wider 
market and more secured and sustainable 
power supply.
TRANSMISSION PLAN FOR RE

include the required connection facilities for 
RE-based power facilities in the TDP, provided 
that such facilities are approved by the DOE. 
The connection facilities of RE plants, including 
the extension of transmission and distribution 
lines, shall be subject only to ancillary services 
covering such connection.”
In developing transmission expansion plans for 
the grid, every project included in the TDP is 
evaluated vis-à-vis the following objectives:
 
• Ensure the reliability and stability of the 
grid considering the load variations of 
intermittent RE resources; 
• Ensure that grid demand requirements 
are met by available supply; 
• Minimize the cost of transmission 
investments passed-through to endusers; and,
• Minimize the cost of energy by providing 
more opportunities for competition and 
mitigating market congestions. 
In addition, the issue associated with provision 
of ancillary services to manage variability in 
both generation and voltage of incoming RE 
plants has to be resolved.
The variable characteristic of wind and solar 
poses distinctive challenges to the operation and 
planning of the network at significant amounts
of integration. With reference to the National 
Renewable Energy Program (NREP) of the DOE 
and in anticipation of the bulk entry of RE plants 
in the upcoming years, the 2012 TDP envisions 
to address the issues in the integration of these 
intermittent or variable RE resources (VRE) to 
the grid. 
As such, efforts in preparing the Grid Connection 
Requirements (GCR) for RE, for wind farms 
and solar PV systems in particular, are being 
considered. With the proposed GCR, provisions 
for RE integration in the transmission network 
will be incorporated into the amended Philippine 
Grid Code (PGC). 
In addition to the long-term concerns associated 
with transmission expansion planning, there is 
also a need to resolve the short-term planning 
issues associated with the entry of RE plants. 
These issues include, among others, the provision 
of ancillary services to manage variability in both 
generation and voltage. Studies are currently 
being conducted, specifically the Renewable
Energy Integration Study (REIS), to determine 
the maximum penetration limit of intermittent 
RE-based power plants and technical mitigation 
to ensure safety and reliability of electricity 
transmission under the RE Law. The primary 
goal of this study is to determine the impact of 
integrating RE to the demand-supply balance 
of the grid by considering its intermittent 
characteristics which are not fully covered in 
the System Impact Study (SIS) conducted for 
each proposed power plant. 
Finally, the different power industry stakeholders 
will be consulted as NGCP formulates additional 
regulations in accommodating the entry of 
these RE resources. There is also the binding 
commitment for continuing research and 
studies for the safety and security of the grid.

Figure 51. PROPOSED LEYTE-MINDANAO 
INTERCONNECTION PROJECT (PHASE 2)Missionary Electrification
The EPIRA of 2001 has stated under Section 70 
that “…the National Power Corporation (NPC) 
shall remain as the national government-owned 
and controlled corporation to perform the 
missionary electrification function in remote and 
off-grid areas through the Small Power Utilities 
Group (SPUG) and shall be responsible for 
providing power generation and its associated 
power delivery systems in areas that are not 
connected in the transmission system…” As 
such, the NPC-SPUG has been mandated with 
missionary electrification function to generate
electricity in far-flung areas where no private
entity is willing or able to provide the same 
service at reasonable cost. 
To support its undertakings, the NPC-SPUG, 
under Rule 13 of the IRR of EPIRA, sources its 
fund from (i) revenues from its sales of electricity 
and other services; (ii) universal charge for 
missionary electrification (UCME), a component
of the power bill charged to all electricity endusers, duly determined by the ERC; and, (iii) 
other funding sources including appropriations 
from Congress, the utilization of private capital, 
multilateral aids or grants, Official Development
Assistance (ODA) Funds and others.
Performance Assessment
PRIVATE SECTOR 
PARTICIPATION (PSP)
NEW POWER PROVIDER (NPP)
Due to the growing electricity requirements 
in missionary areas and limited public funds, 
private capital infusion is seen necessary. 
With this, the government has encouraged and 
espoused the entry of the private sector through 
the implementation of the PSP program. The 
entry of a private entity in areas operated by 
NPC-SPUG is stated under Rule 13, Section 3 
(b) of the IRR of R.A. 9136, which asserts that: 
“SPUG shall periodically assess the requirements 
and prospects for bringing its functions to 
commercial viability on an area-by-area basis at 
the earliest possible time, including a program to 
encourage private sector participation.”
On the other hand, to guarantee that prospective 
NPPs possess suitable level of financial and
technical capacity to participate in the NPC-SPUG 
privatization program, a competitive selection 
process (CSP) was set in D.C. No. 2004-01-001, 
which prescribes the rules and procedures for 
private sector participation in existing NPC-SPUG 
areas pursuant to Rule 13 of the EPIRA IRR.
QUALIFIED THIRD PARTY (QTP)
To ensure that electricity services would also 
reach communities in far-flung areas, the
government likewise launched the QTP program 
inDecember 2005 throughD.C.No. 2005-12-001,
which prescribes the guidelines for participation 
of QTPs in remote and unviable areas pursuant 
to Sections 59 and 70 of EPIRA (detailed 
discussion on the QTP is under the Expanded Rural 
Electrification chapter of the Plan).
First Wave Areas
The first wave of private sector participation in
14 areas being serviced by the NPC-SPUG was 
opened to NPPs in 2004. Out of the 14 areas, 
eight (8) sites are located in Luzon specifically
in Oriental Mindoro, Occidental Mindoro, 
Mainland Palawan, Marinduque, Tablas Island, 
Romblon Island, Masbate and Catanduanes; 
three (3) other sites in the Visayas, namely 
Bantayan Island, Camotes Island and Siquijor; 
and lastly, three (3) sites in Mindanao situated 
in the Sulu archipelago- Basilan, Jolo, Sulu and 
Bongao, Tawi-Tawi.
As of the first semester of 2012, 13 NPPs had
officially entered into 10 PSP areas, namely:
Power One Corp./Mid-island, Ormin Power, 
and Philippine Hybrid Energy (PHESI) in
Oriental Mindoro; Delta P, Palawan Power 
Generation, and DMCI Power Corporation in 
Mainland Palawan; 3i Powergen in the areas 
of Marinduque, Tablas Island and Romblon 
Island; DMCI Power Corporation in Masbate 
area; Catanduanes Power Generation Inc. and 
Sunwest Water and Electric Co. in Catanduanes; 
BIPCOR in the Bantayan Island; S. I. Power 
Corporation (SIPCOR) in Siquijor; and Coastal 
Power in Basilan. Of the 13 NPPs, eight (8) power 
plants were fully installed, with only seven (7) 
generating facilities operational and three (3) 
other power plants under development. 
The PSAs of the NPPs are in various stages of 
approval process with the ERC. 
The status of the First Wave PSP Areas including 
those with no NPPs yet as of period in review 
such as Occidental Mindoro, Camotes Island, 
Jolo, Sulu and Bongao, Tawi-Tawi is shown in 
Table 48.
The privatization of SPUG service areas, aims 
to improve the financial state of NPC. Since
power rates in SPUG areas are partly subsidized 
by the end-users through the UCME charges, 
the privatization scheme once materialized 
could help reduce the UCME rates, in effect, 
lower the power rates of customers served 
by the main grid. Among NPC’s priority areas

Mindoro areas, which constitute about 40.0 
percent of the power generated in SPUG areas.
These areas will undergo competitive bidding 
process in accordance with the MOA signed in 
October 2011 between the DOE, NPC and NEA on 
“Enhanced Private Sector Participation Program 
in Existing NPC-SPUG Areas.”
The said MOA provided for the creation of a 
composite PSP Steering Committee to guide the 
concerned agencies in studying, identifying and 
implementing policies, as well as in formulating 
tender documents to accelerate the entry of 
NPPs in SPUG areas. Further, the MOA delineated 
the responsibilities of each agency on the PSP 
program.
Meanwhile, other service areas, namely 
Catanduanes, Romblon, Tablas Island and 
Siquijor, will be offered following the Palawan 
and Mindoro bidding. Challenging areas such as 
Sulu, Tawi-Tawi and Basilan, are programmed to 
be privatized last.
USE OF RE IN MISSIONARY AREAS
Consistent with the RE Act of 2008, the 
government promotes the use of RE technologies 
as sources of electricity not only in the main grid 
but in missionary areas as well. In support of 
this thrust, ERC issued Resolution No. 2011-21 
in August 2011, titled: “A Resolution Adopting 
the Amended Guidelines for the Setting and 
Approval of Electricity Generation Rates and 
Subsidies for Missionary Electrification Areas.”
Said resolution refined the existing policies
for setting and approval of UCME rates and 
subsidies in SPUG areas. In addition, it provided 
for measures in the availment of cash 
incentives for developers with existing RE 
power generating facilities in missionary 
areas. To guide the ERC with the execution, 
the DOE provided a set of policy directions 
to safeguard the provisions stipulated in the 
resolution, more importantly, to ensure its 
effective implementation.
SPUG SERVICE AREAS
As of June 2012, there are about 233 service 
areas being managed by SPUG. It is comprised of 
167 service areas in Luzon, 44 service areas in 
the Visayas, and 22 service areas in Mindanao. 
There are 42 ECs and seven (7) DUs operating 
in these areas that cover the electrification of
32 provinces consisting of 3,934 barangays and 
over 650,000 households. Figure 52 shows the
locations of power plants covering the SPUG 
areas in the country.
In terms of facilities, a total of 302 power plants 
with total rated and dependable capacity of 
279.9 MW and 202.6 MW respectively, are 
operating in missionary areas (Table 49).

EXISTING AREAS
About 31.8 percent or 96 power plants in SPUG 
service areas are installed in existing areas. Out 
of this figure, 85 are land-based power plants,
while the remaining 11 are barge-mounted 
mobile power plants.
As of June 2012, total rated capacity of power 
plants in existing SPUG areas was posted at 
272.7 MW while dependable capacity stood at 
196.8 MW (Table 50).
Among the major islands, Luzon hosts the most 
number of plants (52 power plants) with total
rated and dependable capacity of 208.6 MW and 
153.6 MW, respectively. Meanwhile, the rated
and dependable capacities of power plants in 
the Visayas and Mindanao SPUG areas were 
recorded at 18.8 MW and 13.6 MW, and 45.3 MW
and 29.6 MW, respectively. By region specific,
Region IV-B has the most installed generating 
facilities with 30 power plants, followed by 
ARMM with 15 plants, and Region VIII with 10
plants.
MINI-GRIDS AND TRANSFERRED AREAS
Accounting for 17.2 percent or an equivalent of 
52 power plants operating in SPUG service areas
comprise the “mini-grids” (or facilities which 
provides both the distribution and generation 
services), including six (6) newly commissioned 
power plants in the first semester of 2012 (Table
51). Moreover, this percentage includes the
so called “transferred areas,” or formerly LGUoperated facilities that were subsequently taken 
over by NPC due to the LGU’s lack of financial
capability to operate.
The rated and dependable capacity of power 
plants under this classification stood only at 5.6
MW and 4.2 MW respectively.
PRES MINI-GRIDS
Contributing the largest share in terms of 
facilities are the mini-grids under the Philippine 
Rural Electrification Service (PRES) Project,
which constitute about 51.0 percent or roughly
154 power plants in SPUG service areas. The
PRES project is an electrification project of the
DOE and NPC which involves the installation 
of diesel-powered mini-grids and solar 
photovoltaic (PV) systems in the remote areas 
of the Bicol region. The project is in consortium 
with French Protocol (NATEXIS and BNP 
Paribas) as the financing institution, and Paris
Manila Technology Corporation (PAMATEC) as 
the firm in-charge in the system installation. For
the PRES mini-grids, rated capacity is 1.6 MW 
while dependable capacity is 
1.5 MW.
Benefiting from the PRES
project are 17,312 households, 
consisting of 5,129 households
installed with PV solar system 
and 12,183 households through

POWER GENERATION
In terms of power generation, SPUG areas 
generated a total of 463 GWh in 2011. Among 
these areas, power generation was highest in 
the 14 PSP areas reaching a level of 383 GWh 
or 82.7 percent of the total gross generation 
in the small island grids. Subsequently, about 
44 GWh or 9.4 percent was generated in other 
Luzon areas, 6 GWh or 1.4 percent in other 
Visayas areas, and 27 GWh or 5.9 percent in
other Mindanao areas. Meanwhile, gross power 
generation in mini-grids and the Masbate PRES 
mini-grids stood at 2 GWh and 1 GWh, or a mere 
0.4 and 0.2 percent, respectively (Table 52).
As of first half of 2012, power generation already
reached 237 GWh. About 81.6 percent of which 
was generated from the 14 PSP areas followed 
by other Luzon areas with 10.3 percent. The 
remaining was contributed by other Visayas 
areas at 1.4 percent, other Mindanao areas at 
6.1 percent, mini-grids and PRES mini-grids at 
0.4 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively.
PEAK DEMAND
Peak demand in SPUG areas reached 137.4 MW 
in 2011. Bulk of this requirement came from 
the 14 PSP areas which stood at 107.1 MW; 
followed by other Luzon areas at 15.2 MW; other
Mindanao areas at 9.3 MW; other Visayas areas 
at 3.4 MW; mini-grids at 1.5 MW; and, PRES
mini-grids at 0.8 MW.
During the first half of 2012, actual peak demand
in SPUG areas was logged at 123.1 MW, which is 
already 89.6 percent of the previous year’s peak 
demand. Similarly, peak demand was highest 
in the 14 PSP areas with 92.9 MW followed by 
other Luzon areas at 15.8 MW, other Mindanao
areas at 8.7 MW, other Visayas areas at 3.2 MW, 
mini-grids at 1.6 MW, and PRES mini-grids at 0.8 
MW (Table 53).
SPUG OPERATING HOURS
Of the 296 power plants operated by SPUG 
(excluding the six (6) newly commissioned 
power plants), only 4.7 percent or 14 facilities 
provide 24-hour electricity supply. Most of these 
areas are served under the PSP program. About 
19.6 percent or 58 generating units on the other
hand, run between eight (8) to 23 hours, while

Measurable Sectoral Targets
Missionary electrification remains one of the
priority thrusts of the government and an 
integral part in national economic development. 
For the planning horizon, the government will 
exert maximum efforts to realize the gradual 
transfer of SPUG’s operations to the private 
sector with the overall goal of improving 
services in missionary areas to meet the surging 
power requirements. 
SECOND WAVE AREAS
The Missionary Electrification Development
Plan (MEDP) 2012-2016 has identified new set
of areas which shall be opened for private sector 
participation in the next five (5) years of the
Plan’s implementation (Table 55).
As programmed in the 2012 MEDP, the first eight
(8) areas exhibit strong demand profiles and are
considered more marketable to private entities. 
As such, these areas will be offered to NPPs in the 
same manner as the 14 first wave areas.
On the other hand, a “business franchising 
model” which aims to raise the service areas’ 
viability level by attaining at least 1 MW peak 
load will be developed. Subsequently, this will be 
introduced in the remaining second wave areas to 
raise its marketability to prospective NPPs. Pilot 
implementation of the said business model will 
be conducted in El Nido, Palawan, as it has the 
highest peak demand among the other remaining 
areas.
PEAK DEMAND FORECAST
System peak demand in SPUG areas is expected 
to increase from 149.8 MW in 2012 to 399.2 MW 
in 2030 at an annual average growth rate of 6.3 
percent.
From its 149.8 MW forecast in 2012, peak 
demand is foreseen to grow to 202.2 MW in 2015,
264.0 MW by 2020, 328.8 MW by 2025 and 399.2
MW by the end of the planning period. Highest
peak will occur in Luzon particularly Region IV-B 
during the 20-year period (Table 56).

Total SPUG 137.35 100.0 123.07 100.0By 2015, NPC-SPUG is anticipating the
full takeover of its power generation 
facilities by NPPs in major SPUG service 
areas such as Oriental Mindoro and 
Palawan in Region IV-B, Catanduanes in 
Region V and Siquijor in Region VII.
OPERATING HOURS
The average operating hours in existing 
areas including the mini-grids and 
transferred areas is foreseen (Table 
57) to significantly improve over the
20-year planning period. By 2020, 
SPUG has programmed that about 
60.0 percent of Luzon’s service areas 
(excluding the service areas under the 
PRES project) will be provided with 24 
hours of electricity supply. 
For Visayas, most of the service areas 
will only be provided with only six (6) 
to seven (7) hours of electricity until 
2020. This unfavorable performance 
can be attributed to the large demand in 
the areas comprising the island, which 
SPUG alone cannot supply considering 
high costs of fuel and limited resources. 
However, service hours will eventually
improve beyond 2020 due to an increase in the 
island’s capacity addition.
In Mindanao, about 60.8 percent of its off-grid 
will be provided with electricity of not more 
than ten (10) hours per day by 2012, while 
only 21.7 percent will have 24 hours access to 
electricity. However, the percent share of those
areas with 24-hour operations is expected to 
decrease starting 2015 due to additional service
areas to be covered by SPUG during this year. 
But with anticipated increase in its capacity 
additions, SPUG plans to enforce full 24-hour 
operation in 53.1 percent of its service areas by
2020 to reach 68.8 percent in 2030.
To further improve SPUG’s over-all performance, 
the DOE is set to issue two (2) Circulars which 
cover: (1) transitory guidelines on allowable 
fuel rates and plant use and losses; and (2) 
transitory guidelines on generation and 
distribution reliability. The issuance of the 
transitory guidelines is anticipated by the end 
of 2012.
CAPACITY ADDITIONS
To meet the increasing electricity demand and 
further improve the operating hours of power 
plants in SPUG service areas, an estimated total 
capacity addition of 322.4 MW are required in 
the small island grids from 2012 up to 2030. For 
all off-grid areas, a projected 56.1 MW capacity
addition is required starting 2012; 44.9 MW by 
2015; 46.2 MW by 2020; 119.8 MW by 2025;
and 55.4 MW by the end of 2030 (Table 58). For
the entire planning period, Luzon, particularly 
Region IV-B, will require more capacity additions 
as compared to the Visayas and Mindanao islands

excluding the 154 mini-grids under the PRES project due to its projected demand. The region is host 
to some of the country’s tourist destinations. 
Meanwhile, as shown in Table 59, planned
capacity additions in small island grids could
display sustainability vis-à-vis the forecasted 
peak demand. This implies that missionary 
areas are assured of available power supply 
over the planning period although not all areas 
would be provided with 24- hour operation.
TRANSMISSION 
DEVELOPMENT PLAN
BATANGAS-MINDORO 
INTERCONNECTION PROJECT
As indicated in the 2011 TDP, the 
Batangas-Mindoro interconnection 
project is anticipated to be on stream by 
2014. The transmission project links the 
island of Mindoro to the Luzon main grid 
through the installation of a 230-kilovolt 
(kV) submarine cable which is seen to 
provide Mindoro with an additional 300 
MW capacity thus strengthening the 
transmission backbone of the island. 
Said interconnection project would entail 
private investments estimated at PhP 
11.0 billion.
Upon implementation of the project, 
Mindoro Island will have: (1) stable 
and reliable power supply; (2) access to 
cheaper power from generators in the Luzon 
grid; and, (3) improved economy brought 
by possible entry of energy investments 
and business expansions in the tourism and 
manufacturing industries. 
Development Challenges
With the privatization of NPC assets, the NPCSPUG’s reduced financial allocation from the
national government remains a continuing 
challenge to fully carry out the agency’s 
mandate. The other related concerns include 
the following: 
• Issuance of DOJ opinion dated in January 
2010 prohibiting NPC to borrow funds and/
or issue new bonds for funding requirement 
of SPUG; and 
• Perennial delays in the approval of petitioned 
UCME rates and adjustments by the ERC.
Meanwhile, as a result of the series of consultation 
workshop for the formulation of the 2012 MEDP

Innovation Energie Développement (IED), the 
following major problems and challenges in 
missionary electrification were identified, to wit:
A. SPUG
• Need for ERC’s timely approval of requested 
subsidies or cost adjustments;
• Outdated equipment, lack of spare parts, 
fuel shortages and poor maintenance of 
NPC gensets resulting in reduced operating 
hours and power shortages in service areas; 
and,
• Security and peace and order situation in 
some SPUG service areas (i.e. Sulu and TawiTawi) which deter the entry of NPPs for the 
PSP program.
B. NPPs
• Contract and subsidy related issues with 
existing NPPs (e.g. delay in the payment of 
UC-ME subsidy by NPC);
• Low interest of private sector to invest in 
SPUG areas due to poor performance of ECs.
C. QTP
• Need to refine QTP guidelines to:(i) expedite
approval process; (ii) consider ECs as 
eligible QTP; and (iii) ECs as direct recipient 
of subsidy from UCME or QTP (subsidies 
given to QTPs should be extended to ECs).
D. DUs/ECs
• Need for the DOE’s intervention pertaining 
to the non-compliance to the Power Supply 
Agreements (PSAs) by some NPPs;
• Need for reliable power supply from NPPs/
QTPs/NPC;
• Lack of interested NPP in some areas;
• Need for more efficient collection from its
consumers;
• Need to reduce if not fully eliminate power 
pilferage; and
• Lack of technical capacity building in 
formulating load forecasts.
• Use of RE in Missionary Electrification
• Need for priority connection, dispatch and 
transmission related infrastructure for RE.
Plans and Programs
In response to the challenges being encountered 
by SPUG, the following initiatives/measures will 
be undertaken by NPC to augment its financial
resources: 
• Appeal for supplemental funding from the 
government in lieu of the issuance of DOJ 
opinion which prevents the agency from 
incurring debt;
• Accelerate the privatization of identified
SPUG service areas that are PSP-viable to 
reduce the agency’s incurring losses from 
the operation and maintenance expenses 
of its facilities as well as from the subsidy 
provided to missionary areas;
• Work for stronger regulatory support from 
ERC in coordination with DOE; and 
• Develop and institutionalize a new business 
model for DUs/ECs and private entities.
Meanwhile, to improve the operation of ECs 
and to attract private sector investments in 
missionary areas, SPUG has come up with a list 
of action plan, to wit:
• Propose amendment to DOE Circular 
04-001-01 to enhance PSP capability in 
determining demand, technology options 
and network configuration in missionary
areas, and contracting additional capacity 
requirements;
• Institutionalize clear policy guidelines
in contracting additional capacities and 
facilities;
• Accelerate privatization of existing NPCSPUG generating assets and provision of 
transmission facilities;
• Collaborate with DOE and NEA in providing 
competency building for DUs/ECs;
• Implement subsidy graduation program 
and introduce inter-class subsidy (such that 
within the same service area, the consumers 
with higher electricity consumption subsidize 
the power rates of consumers with lower 
electricity consumption) in small island 
grids;
• Promote RE in missionary areas considering 
the appropriate installation target, 
technology and minimum RE penetration in 
missionary areas;
• Transfer of waived areas or existing 
systems to NPC-SPUG upon ERC approval 
of corresponding UCME allocation for these 
areas;
• Intensify the promotion of investment 
opportunities in SPUG to NPPs/QTPs and 
other private entities; and,
• Integrate regional development programs, 
through close coordination with Local 
Government Units, in MEDP to determine 
the power requirements of future local 
development plans.EPIRA Developments
After ten (10) years of the EPIRA implementation, 
several issues are still confronting the power 
industry, to wit: (i) high cost of electricity; (ii) 
electric power supply security and reliability; 
and (iii) full implementation of market 
competition. Some sectors even clamored for 
the amendments of certain provisions of the 
EPIRA on the premise that it has been ineffective 
in addressing the said issues. 
It may be recalled that EPIRA was signed on 21 
June 2001 with the primary aim of instituting 
the needed reforms in the electric power sector 
and curtailing the vast expenditure of the 
government in the sector’s development. The 
Law likewise envisioned that the private sector 
would provide a competitive environment, 
which would result in a more reliable, efficient
and affordable supply of electricity in the 
country. Given the emerging challenges in the 
sector, more improvements have to be pursued 
under President Aquino’s administration to 
ensure timely and effective implementation 
of the structural reforms that may necessitate 
possible amendments of the Law. 
Some of the major highlights of the decadelong implementation of EPIRA include: (i) the 
launching of WESM in Luzon and Visayas; (ii) 
privatization of the NPC generation assets; 
(iii) transfer of NPC-Independent Power 
Producer (IPP) to IPP Administrators (IPPA); 
(iv) concession of the national transmission 
network; (v) administration of universal 
charge; (vi) implementation of institutional 
change meant to shape up the operations of 
electric cooperatives; and the (vii) declaration 
of the implementation of Retail Competition 
and Open Access (RCOA) on a phase-in and 
partial implementation program. Efforts were 
also focused in amending the EPIRA particularly 
provisions in extending the life of the JCPC and 
the extension of the implementation of the 
lifeline rate subsidy. 
WHOLESALE ELECTRICITY 
SPOT MARKET (WESM)
The establishment of the WESM has transformed 
the inherently inefficient monopolistic electric
power industry to a more efficient and
competitive trading system thereby stabilizing 
supply, demand and price for electricity.
Almost five (5) years of commercial operation, 
WESM Luzon is now integrated with the Visayas 
WESM after the latter’s commercial operation 
on 26 December 2010 thus giving the Visayas 
grid a more efficient and competitive trading
system. 
WESM has provided market signals to investors 
that resulted in increased number of market 
participants for the integrated Luzon and 
Visayas market. As of June 2012, the number 
of trading participants totaled 251 consisting
of 54 generating companies and 197 customer
trading participants.

PRIVATIZATION
The privatization of the remaining NPC/Power 
Sector Assets and Liabilities Management 
(PSALM) 
Corporation generating assets and IPP 
contracts has been deferred following the 
new administration’s call for a review of the 
privatization plan and the need to address 
the seasonal supply interruptions. The 
developments in the sector are only focused on 
the continuing activity of PSALM to complete 
the remaining legal, financial and technical
requirements for the smooth turn-over of the 
privatized power plants and IPP contracts.
Towards the end of June 2012, the government’s 
privatization program for the remaining assets, 
i.e., generating assets and contracted capacities 
of IPPs, pursued in accordance with the PSALM 
Board’s approved timetable and direction set 
by the DOE consistent with the EPIRA. As of 
June 2012, 20 generating plants have been 
successfully bid out by PSALM to its private 
owners with a total aggregate capacity of 4,115.2

Some of the major issues that affected the privatization efforts of the government include: (i) the transfer of Angat Hydroelectric 
Power Plant to the new owner; and, (ii) the resolution on the stored energy and stored energy payments of Bacon-Manito 
Geothermal Power Plant (BMGPP). The transfer of Angat Hydroelectric Power Plant to the new owner, the Korea Water Resources 
Development Corporation or K-Water, was delayed with the issuance of Status Quo Ante Order by the Supreme Court (SC) on 24 
May 2010. However, in its 09 October 2012 decision, the SC declared as valid and legal the bidding conducted and the Notice of 
Award issued by PSALM in favor of the winning bidder. Also, according to the SC decision, the NPC shall continue to be the holder 
of Water Permit No. 6512 issued by the National Water Resources Board (NWRB). The NPC shall authorize K-Water to utilize the 
waters in the Angat Dam for hydropower generation subject to the NWRB’s rules and regulations governing water right and usageMW or 94.6 percent of PSALM-owned capacities 
in the Luzon and Visayas grids. 
Turn-over of NPC-IPP Contracts to IPP 
Administrators
As of June 2012, IPPA privatization level 
already reached 76.9 percent. Table 62 shows 
the indicative privatization schedule for the 
appointment of IPP administrator as of June 
2012. 
Sale of Sub-Transmission Assets (STAs)
As of June 2012, TransCo already signed 
101 sale contracts with 75 distribution
utilities/electric cooperatives/consortia 
amounting to about PhP 5.30 billion covering
an aggregate length of about 3,700 ckt-kms 
of sub-transmission lines and 33,000 subtransmission structures and 850 MVA of
substation capacity. Of the 101 sales contracts, 
45 contracts with total sale price of PhP 2.30
billion have been approved by the ERC. The 
rest of the sales contracts are for ERC filing, 
evaluation or approval.
Following the EPIRA provision of extending 
concessional financing to electric cooperatives,
TransCo implemented lease purchase 
arrangements for a term of 20 years. Of the 101 
sales contracts, 61 are under lease purchase 
agreements with 54 electric cooperatives/
consortia, valued at about PhP 3.42 billion.
The remaining 40 
involved sales to private 
distribution utilities.
TransCo is looking 
forward to the sale of 
about 1,200 ckt-km 
of sub-transmission 
lines and 500 MVA of
substation equipment
among 42 interested 
distribution utilities 
within the next four (4) 
years. 
Administration of Universal Charge (UC)
As June 2012, total collections/remittances to 
PSALM reached PhP 25.52 billion, PhP 24.75
billion of which was disbursed by PSALM to 
NPC-SPUG for environment and watershed 
rehabilitation and missionary electrification,
respectively. Total interest earnings from 
deposits and placements of UC funds reached 
PhP 0.11 billion, while the UC fund balance was 
estimated at about PhP 0.88 billion. 
PSALM received a total of PhP 5.30 billion in
UC remittances from collecting entities and 
disbursed the total amount of PhP 5.19 billion
to NPC-SPUG for missionary electrification.
In compliance with the EPIRA and its IRR and
PSALM’s Guidelines and Procedures Governing 
Remittances and Disbursement of the Universal 
Charge, the ERC issued on 27 June 2011 the 
Rules and Procedures Governing the Utilization 
and Disbursement of UC–Environmental Charge 
(UC-EC) per ERC Resolution No. 18. The NPC 
filed a petition with the ERC on 14 March 2012
for the availment of the environmental share 
from UC in the amount of PhP 287.44 million 
covering CY 2012. No disbursement has been 
made to NPC for UC-EC since 2009 pending the 
approval of the petitions filed. On 16 July 2012,
the ERC Case No. 2007-098 rendered a Decision 
authorizing PSALM to release the amount of 
PhP 58.83 million to NPC to fund its CY 2007
Watershed Management Program.

Mandatory Rate Reduction 
Pursuant to Section 72 of the EPIRA, NPC has 
continuously granted a PhP 30-centavo/kWh 
reduction on electricity rates for residential endusers whose franchised DU sources power from 
NPC. In 2011, total discounts granted by NPC 
amounted to PhP 676.47 million, of which 64.8 
percent was availed by residential customers in 
Mindanao, 21.9 percent in the Visayas and 13.3 
percent in Luzon. 
Lifeline Subsidy Rate
Section 73 of EPIRA states that lifeline subsidy 
rate will only be implemented for a period of 
10 years. Before the program expired in June 
2011, President Aquino signed into law R.A. 
10150 on 21 June 2011, amending Section 73
which provides another ten (10) years of lifeline 
subsidy implementation. However, additional
criteria will be observed to ensure that only 
certified poor households will benefit from the
subsidy. The proposal redefines marginalized
end-users as those with electricity loads limited 
only to basic lighting, cooling (electric fan) radio, 
and television. More than two million lowincome households nationwide are expected to 
benefit from the discounted electricity rates.
In 2011, a total of 3,313,831 lifeline customers 
with aggregate consumption of 125,804,287
kilowatt hour already availed of the subsidy, 
of which 62.6 percent was customers of the 
private distribution utilities and the remaining 
(37.4 percent) from electric cooperatives. Total 
discounts availed by lifeline customers reached 
PhP 370,143,527.11, while the total amount
of subsidy given by the 8,174,293 non-lifeline 
customers amounted to PhP 374,670,175.84.
COMPETITION
The EPIRA envisions that opening up of the 
electricity market to competition both at 
the wholesale and retail levels shall improve 
efficiency in the generation sector, which would
redound to lower electricity prices. Although 
competition at the retail level has not been 
implemented yet, significant developments at
the wholesale level have been realized during 
the last ten years. 
Retail Competition and Open Access (RCOA)
Recent developments in the privatization of 
NPC generating assets and NPC-IPP contracts 
prompted the ERC, motu propio, to conduct

compliance to the five pre-conditions set by
Section 31 of EPIRA for the implementation 
of RCOA72. As a result, on 06 June 2011, 
ERC issued Resolution No. 10 declaring the 
compliance to EPIRA prerequisites and the 
actual commencement of RCOA on 26 December 
2011. Under RCOA, all electricity end-users 
with an average monthly peak demand of one 
MW for the period of 12 months preceding 
the declaration date, as certified by the ERC,
could become contestable customers. They will 
have the right to choose their own electricity 
suppliers and are enjoined to exercise such 
right to their full benefit. Likewise, the ERC
has started to prepare the necessary regulatory 
framework for the implementation of RCOA, 
which includes amendment to the rules on the 
issuance of license to retail electricity suppliers 
to ensure a level playing field in the competitive 
retail electricity market. 
On 17 June 2011, the DOE issued D.C. 2011-
06-006 titled “Creating the Steering Committee 
Defining the Policies for the Commencement 
of Retail Competition and Open Access.” This 
is aimed to provide the transition framework 
and synchronize the preparatory actions 
towards ensuring the sufficiency of existing
rules, infrastructures and other institutional 
requirements necessary to achieve the goals 
of EPIRA. Such Circular established the RCOA 
Steering Committee – Technical Working Group 
(RCOA SC-TWG) on 8 July 2011 consisting of three 
(3) Sub-groupings, namely: (i) Risk Management; 
(ii) Finance; and (iii) Technical Assessment. 
On 24 October 2011, the ERC issued a decision 
through ERC Case No. 2011-009RM deferring 
the implementation of RCOA in Luzon and 
Visayas on the basis of the RCOA SC Resolution 
NO. 2011-01, which enumerates unresolved 
major policy and operational issues. 
72 “Retail Competition” refers to the provision of electricity 
to a Contestable Market by Suppliers through open Access. 
“Open Access” refers to the system of allowing any qualified 
person the use of transmission, and/or distribution 
system, and associated facilities subject to the payment of 
transmission and/or distribution retail wheeling rates duly 
approved by the ERC
Several D.C.s were also issued to include: (i) D.C. 
2012-02-0002 on 24 February 2012 Appointing 
PEMC as Central Registry Body73; and (ii) D.C. 
2012-05-0005 on 09 May 2012 Prescribing the 
General Policies for the Implementation of RCOA. 
On 24 September 2012, the DOE and ERC 
issued a joint statement that set the initial 
implementation of RCOA on 26 December 2012 on 
a phase-in and partial implementation program. 
The first six months of RCOA implementation
is envisaged to be a transition period for all 
concerned parties to ensure a smooth transition 
to full RCOA implementation. Transition period 
covers the registration, discussion, trainings 
and simulations among suppliers, contestable 
customers and other stakeholders. During 
transition, distribution utilities shall continue to 
serve contestable customers in their respective 
franchise area, while contestable customers 
may enter into supply contracts with suppliers 
but such shall only take effect as the end of the 
transition period. For the initial year of the full 
RCOA commercial operation, supply contracts 
between contestable customers and suppliers 
shall have a minimum term of one year. After 
the first year, more flexible supply contracts and
switching exercise shall be allowed in accordance 
with the Retail Rules74. Meanwhile, in the event 
that a supplier of a contestable customer has 
defaulted on its obligation or fails to provide 
electricity, the franchised DU shall act as the 
Supplier of Last Resort (SOLR)75. 
73 The “Central Registry Body” refers to the entity in charge 
of the B2B system with the end-in-view of fulfilling an 
efficient enrollment and switching by the end-users in the 
competitive retail market 
74 Retail Rules and implementing market manuals will govern 
the integration of retail competition in the operations 
and governance of the WESM, the management of the 
transactions of suppliers and contestable customers in 
the WESM, and the operations of the Central Registry 
Body. Retail rules and implementing manuals will apply 
to all electric power industry participants and will cover 
registration of contestable customers and suppliers, 
metering, billing and settlements of supplier transactions. 
75 SOLR is an event when a supplier of a contestable 
customer has defaulted on its obligations or fails to provide 
electricity based on the following reasons: (i) cessation 
of its operation; (ii) revocation of its license; (iii) nonpayment of transmission and distribution services; (iv) 
suspension of its membership in the WESM due to noncompliance to WESM Rules and retail market rules; and 
(v) such other grounds that may be specified by ERC
RCOA trial run will be carried out in March 
2013, while commercial transactions based 
on an interim development system will be 
engaged on 26 June 2013. On the other hand, 
the IT infrastructure is scheduled to be in 
place by the last quarter of 2013. In view of the 
commencement ofRCOA,the ERC is finalizing the
Transitory Rules for the Initial Implementation 
of Open Access and Retail Competition to 
ensure a smooth transition from the existing 
structure to a competitive environment, as well 
as promote the interests of all stakeholders in 
the electricity industry.
Extension of the Life of Joint Congressional 
Power Commission (JCPC)
In aid of legislation, the JCPC was created to 
set the guidelines and overall framework to 
monitor and ensure the proper implementation 
of the provision of the law, among others. Based 
on the EPIRA, the Commission shall only exist 
for a period of ten (10) years following EPIRA’s 
effectivity. However, JCPC’s life may be extended
through a joint concurrent resolution of both 
houses of the legislature considering that the 
electric power industry is still transitioning 
after ten (10) years of EPIRA implementation. 
Likewise, the sector is still facing the challenges 
of ensuring energy supply and providing 
reasonable power rates to both the investors 
in the power industry and the electricity 
consumers. After due consultation with 
stakeholders, the Senate Committee on Energy 
issued Senate Joint Resolution No. 9 titled 
“Resolution Extending the Period of Existence of 
JCPC,” which was signed by President Aquino on 
21 June 2011. 
Continuing Implementation of Power Sector 
Reforms
The restructuring of the electricity industry 
calls for the separation of the different 
components of the power sector – generation, 
transmission, distribution and supply. The 
privatization of the NPC, covering both 
generation and transmission assets, was 
aimed at encouraging greater competition and 
attracting private-sector investments in the 
electric power industry. Such is envisioned to 
lower power rates and to have a more efficient
delivery of electricity supply to end-users. 
However, ten (10) years after EPIRA enactment,
the sector still faces several challenges to 
include: 
A. Full Implementation of retail competition 
and open access. Strong policy and 
regulatory support is needed for market 
participants to enjoy the benefit of choice.
Retail rules and transitory rules for the 
initial implementation of RCOA should be 
properly reviewed and shall apply to all 
electric power industry participants. 
B. Proposed amendments to some provisions 
of EPIRA. With its implementation, issues 
like power supply security and high cost 
of electricity still confront the Philippine 
electric power industry. Many sectors have 
clamoured for the amendments of certain 
provisions or total abolition of the EPIRA on 
the premise that it has been ineffective to 
address the said issues. To fully realize the 
objectives of EPIRA, several other initiatives 
will be firmly pursued by the government in
lieu of EPIRA amendments as follows: 
p Exclusion/exemption of hydro complexes 
in Mindanao – Agus and Pulangi – from 
privatization/sale, while the remaining 
unsold assets (i.e., Caliraya-BotocanKalayan and Malaya Plant Complex) 
shall be retained as security assets; 
p Electric Power Crisis provision in which 
the President of the Philippines, upon 
recommendation of the DOE (as Congress 
may authorize), may direct for the 
establishment of additional generating 
capacity in case of imminent shortage of 
electricity supply; and,p Conversion of Electric Cooperatives 
provision where cooperatives are given 
the option to convert into either stock 
cooperative under the Cooperatives 
Development Act (CDA) or stock 
corporation under the Corporation 
Code. However, additional measure is
being proposed in view of the various 
financial constraints faced by the electric
cooperatives, to wit: 
“In case of electric cooperatives taken 
over by NEA, NEA shall have the power 
to facilitate the conversion of these 
electric cooperatives to be able to 
introduce private sector investment for 
the rehabilitation and management. NEA 
shall issue the appropriate implementing 
rules and regulations to carry out this 
provision; Provided that the power of 
NEA to take over electric cooperatives 
shall include instances of delayed or nonpayment of transmission, generation, and 
other charges including universal charge.”
p Advance the proposed amendments 
to the National Electrification
Administration Charter to strengthen 
the powers and functions of the agency 
and accelerate the government’s rural 
electrification program;
p Resolve the imposition of VAT to power 
rates including the impact of the LGU 
Code to existing and future operations 
and projects of the power stakeholders;
p Review and validate the operation of 
distribution utilities and NGCP vis-à-vis 
the applicable rate methodology being 
adopted; and,
p Revisit the mechanism of lifeline subsidy 
to really identify the marginal customers 
who are the real target beneficiary.
C. RE Act of 2008. As the implementation is 
still in earlier stages, putting in place the 
necessary mechanism to facilitate entry 
of RE sources is of immediate concern. 
Harmonization of EPIRA Law with the RE
Law will also require strong policy and 
regulatory support from the government 
such as the development of RE market 
policy instruments to include DOE Circular 
establishing RE Market and RE Registrar, RE 
Market Rules, RE Registrar operating rules 
and RE Market IT infrastructure design.
Access to electricity is essential in improving 
the quality of life of the people as it facilitates 
opportunities for growth and development. 
Electrification is either done through grid or offgrid connection. When a barangay is provided 
with electricity through grid connection, it 
means that the distribution line has reached the 
barangay proper. It may also mean that almost 
50.0 percent of potential households in the
barangay are connected to a DU (i.e. MERALCO) 
or at least one is connected to other DUs. Off-grid 
connection pertains to a barangay having about 
20 to 30 households availing the connection.
Off-grid solutions through renewable energy 
forms such as solar home systems (SHS) bring
light to far-flung communities in the country and
is favorable as well to the environment. It also 
provides a temporary solution until a community 
is able to become economically viable to be 
connected to the main grid.
The government is tasked to ensure that all 
barangays have access to electricity. The DOE 
together with NEA and NPC-SPUG take the lead 
in the country’s electrification efforts.
The DOE funds electrification projects of both
grid and off-grid areas through the electrification
fund (EF) component of Energy Regulations 
1-94 (ER 1-94). In addition, the Department 
also implemented locally-funded projects (LFPs) 
such as the Barangay Electrification Program
(BEP) and Remote Area Electrification Subsidy
(RAES) which aimed at increasing electricity 
access of barangays/communities. 
Meanwhile, NEA is responsible in providing ongrid electricity access to communities through 
the 119 ECs that it oversees. NEA ensures that 
these ECs deliver quality electricity services to 
their respective franchise areas.
Section 70 of EPIRA, on the other hand, directs 
the NPC-SPUG in undertaking “missionary 
electrification” or the provision of power 
generation and its corresponding delivery 
systems to areas that are not connected to the 
transmission system.
For the planning period, the electrification
program envisages the following goals: a) 100 
percent barangay electrification by end 2012; b) 
90 percent household electrification by 2017; and 
c) 100 percent sitio electrification by 2015.
Performance Assessment
In determining the 2012 barangay76
electrification level, the DOE used as reference
the 2005 Census which reflected 41,97477 as the 
total number of barangays in the country. 
As of 31 August 2012, the country’s barangay 
electrification level stands at 99.98 percent. In
2011 and 2010, the electrification level stood at
99.94 percent and 99.89 percent respectively. 
From 27 unenergized barangays in 2011, only 
nine (9) are left to be provided with electricity by 
end of the year. Mindanao remains the only island 
grid with unenergized barangays (Table 64). 
Based on the regional electrification profile
(Table 65), 16 of the 17 regions are already
100.0 percent energized. The unenergized 
barangays of ARMM are located in the provinces 
of Maguindanao and Tawi-Tawi. 
76 Section 384 of RA 7160 or the “Local Government Code of 
1991” defines barangay as the basic political unit in the country. 
It serves as the primary planning and implementing unit of 
government policies, plans, programs, projects and activities in 
the community, and as a forum where the collective views of 
the people may be expressed, crystallized and considered, and 
disputes amicably be settled. 
77 Based on 2005 Census, total number of barangays recorded 
was at 41,980. Said number was reduced to 41,974 because 
six barangays had specific implementation issues which are: 
barangay is deserted, lies in a permanent danger zone, barangay 
was comprised of a group of informal settlers lying on private 
property, barangay captain rejected the electrification project 
and existing peace and order problem
VI. SOCIALLY RESPONSIVE PROGRAMS
Expanded Rural ElectrificationThe 119 ECs in the country have achieved 99.98 
percent energization in their franchise areas. 
Manila Electric Company (MERALCO) on the 
other hand, has already reached 100 percent 
energization in its covered locations. Private 
investor-owned utilities (PIOUs) together with 
LGUs also recorded 100 percent energization 
level (Table 66).
Household Electrification
The government is bent on 
achieving 90.0 percent household 
electrification by 2017. The move
to bring electricity access at the 
household level was stated as one of 
the objectives under D.C. No. 2003-
04-00478 which was signed then by former 
Energy Secretary Vincent S. Perez.
As of 30 December 2011, household 
electrification level stands at 70.2 percent. This
means that out of the 20.5 million households,
14.4 million are with electricity connection79
(Table 67).
Sitio80 Electrification
Apart from barangays and households, the 
government’s program also extends to sitio 
electrification. NEA’s data as of 30 June 2012
reflects that 81,736 out of the 115,092 sitios
are already with electricity translating to a 71.0 
percent sitio electrification level.
In 2011, NEA was able to energize 2,148 sitios 
throughout the country. This includes the 1,520

90-days with a working budget of PhP 814.00 
million. From 2012 – 2015, it is expected that
30,291 more sitios will be energized by NEA.
Private Sector Participation 
 
Based on the provisions of R.A. 9136 or the 
“Electric Power Industry Reform Act”, programs 
are in place to encourage the entry of private 
sector in rural electrification. The QTP and the
NPP programs provide the framework to involve 
the private sector in the provision of electricity 
services to unviable and missionary areas. 
Qualified Third Party (QTP)
The EPIRA81 provides that if a franchised 
utility is unable to provide electricity services 
to remote and unviable villages, a QTP would 
be allowed to come in. The QTP program is 
designed to attract alternative service providers 
and private investments in rural electrification.
Said program is also an integrated, generated 
and associated distribution system, which 
means that the QTP shall be responsible for the 
generation of power and its effective distribution 
to the area/community. 
At present, the country’s pilot QTP is 
PowerSource Philippines Inc. (PSPI) which 
provides 24/7 electricity services to about 1,514
households in Barangay Rio Tuba, Palawan (see 
picture). 
The ERC issued a Permanent Authority to 
Operate (ATO) to PSPI for its Rio Tuba QTP 
Project in June 2010. Correspondingly, there are 
two other QTP projects undergoing preparation 
81 Section 59 of RA 9136 and Rule 14 of the EPIRAIRR
with assistance from the DOE. These are PSPI’s 
Malapascua QTP project in Bantayan, Cebu and 
Semirara Mining Corporation’s (SMC) QTP project 
in Caluyan, Antique.
PSPI completed the installation of its Malapascua 
Community Energizer Platform Project in the 2nd
quarter of 2010. In April 2011, the installation of 
transmission and distribution lines was realized 
(this was achieved with funding from KEPCO). 
Currently, PSPI is packaging its Certificate of
Compliance application to ERC. They are also 
undertaking project sites identification for their
other QTP projects (initial areas identified are
Liminangcong and Port Barton in Palawan). As 
for SMC’s initiative to engage as QTP in Antique, 
it has appointed its subsidiary, DMCI Power, as 
the legal entity to apply as prospective QTP. The 
Antique Electric Cooperative (ANTECO) issued a 
Board Resolution dated 28 April 2011 declaring 
the barangays of Alegia, Semirara and Tinogboc 
in Semirara Island, Antique as unviable and 
open for QTP participation. The said barangays 
as proposed by SMC to be its service area has 
about 2,316 households. 
New Power Provider (NPP)
The NPP is another program designed to encourage 
private sector participation in NPC-SPUG areas. As 
asserted in EPIRA’s IRR (Rule 13, Section b), “SPUG 
shall periodically assess the requirements and 
prospects for bringing its functions to commercial 
viability on an area-by-area basis at the earliest 
possible time, including a program to encourage 
private sector participation.” Correspondingly, 
DOE’s issuance of D.C. No. 2004-01-001 in January 
2004 opened all SPUG areas for private sector 
participation (PSP) and set the procedures for a 
competitive selection process. 
Initially, 14 first wave areas
were offered for the NPP. For 
the proposed second wave areas 
to be offered, 15 areas were
identified (detailed discussion on 
the NPP and areas offered is under 
the Missionary Electrification 
portion of the plan).

Electrification
Rural Power Project (RPP)
The RPP with funding support from the World 
Bank, GEF, and DOE aimed to support the 
implementation of reforms and improve the 
quality of life in rural areas of the country 
through adequate, affordable and reliable 
energy services, in partnership with the private 
sector. The RPP promoted the use of sustainable 
and least-cost decentralized electrification
solutions through public-private partnerships 
and investments.
RPP was implemented by two agencies, the DOE 
through its Project Management Office (PMO)
and the Development Bank of the Philippines 
PMO. The Project became effective on 6 May 
2004. Following an amendment to the GEF 
Grant Agreement in October 2009, the closing 
date of the said Grant was extended from 31 
December 2009 to 31 December 2011. The 
extension granted allowed for more time to 
complete ongoing activities and to pilot new 
service delivery mechanisms that are promising 
and sustainable.
During the course of the project, 
about 18,003 households benefitted
from the use of decentralized systems 
particularly solar PV. Solar home 
systems were installed on 15,289 HH
while solar lanterns were used for 
2,714HH. Moreover,therewere public
facility installations of communal PV 
facilities which totaled 2,302 during 
the project’s duration. 
United States Agency for International 
Development (USAID)– Alliance for Mindanao 
Off-grid Renewable Energy (AMORE)
The AMORE was a partnership between 
USAID, Mirant Philippines, ARMM, Winrock 
International and the DOE. The program 
provided electricity to conflict-affected and offgrid areas in Mindanao using renewable energy 
systems. In 2009, 28 barangays in the areas 
of Maguindanao, Zamboanga del Norte and Sulu 
were energized through Solar PV systems. In 
addition, two (2) barangays namely KarimMinabay and Tubak in the areas of Shariff 
Kabunsuan and Maguindanao benefitted from
village hydro electrification project.
The project was also responsible for organizing 
and training the members of the community 
into having a Barangay Renewable Energy 
and Community Development Associations 
(BRECDAs). The BRECDA is responsible for 
operating and maintaining the system. The 
program also taught the community to pursue 
other development projects. 
Measurable Sectoral Targets
The DOE will energize the nine (9) 
remaining unenergized barangays 
located in Mindanao by end of 2012. 
Table 62 shows the ARMM provinces 
still with the unenergized barangays.

The household electrification program intends
to reach 90.0 percent of the country’s total 
households by 2017. Table 63 shows the 
annual targets (including potential) for the HH
electrification.
The Department supports this program through 
its ongoing locally-funded project titled 
Household Electrification in Off-grid Areas
Using Renewable Energy. The project provides 
electricity access to 2,000 HH annually by using
solar (through SHS) and other available RE
sources (least cost) specific to an off-grid area.
On the other hand, NEA will undertake its 
Sitio Electrification Program (SEP) which has
identified about 4,487 sitios as of 2012 as
recipients of electricity services (Table 70). 
Infrastructure support will also be vital in 
attaining total barangay electrification. From
2012 – 2013 about 3,827 ckt-kms of distribution 
lines may necessitate expansion. Meanwhile, 
grid areas may also require an additional 1,295
MVA of substation capacities for the same 
period. Distribution line rehabilitation to about 
2,950 ckt-kms may also be needed to deliver
reliable and efficient supply of electricity (Table
71).
Development Challenges
One of the challenges identified in the effective
delivery of electricity services to communities 
are the operational and procedural delays that 
affect project completion.
These delays in project completion are attributed 
to factors such as right-of-way (ROW) problems 
and stringent permitting, and approval process 
for household connections. 
Plans and Programs 
The DOE will strengthen its coordination with 
LGUs and other concerned agencies to facilitate 
the timely completion of projects. It will also 
pursue the development and implementation 
of innovative service delivery mechanisms 
to increase household connections such as 
partnering with DUs in implementing grid and 
off-grid electrification.
 
To ensure the attainment of the household 
electrification targets, the DOE will formulate
the Household Electrification Development
Plan (HEDP) to lay out the households to be
programmed for electrification from 2012 to 2017.
The NEA on the other hand will be guided by 
its Sitio Electrification Plan to achieve the 100
percent energization of sitios by 2015. NEA will
be provided with an annual allocation of PhP 
2.00 billion to be sourced from the Malampaya 
fund to carry out the task. 
For the planning horizon 2012 - 2030, it is 
expected that the entire country will have full 
access to electricity.

As specified under ER 1-94, the DOE ensures
that communities hosting generating facilities 
or energy resource development projects 
are benefited82. It is a way of recognizing the 
contribution of host communities for sharing 
and using their territory to put up generating 
facilities to energize the rest of the country. 
ER 1-94 provides for funds that can be accessed 
by host communities to further foster progress 
in their respective areas. Availment of such 
benefits requires host communities to submit
project proposals which may be under any of 
the following: EF, development and livelihood 
fund (DLF) and reforestation, watershed 
management, health and/or environment 
enhancement fund (RWMHEEF).
Performance Assessment
From the inception of ER 1-94 up to June 
2012, 5,470 projects were already approved
amounting to PhP 5.46 billion (Table 72). Most
of these are EF projects which comprises about 
61.8 percent of the total.
For the first half of 2012, the DOE approved a
total of 568 projects amounting to PhP 566.86
82 Section 5 (i) of R.A. 7638 or the “Department of Energy Act of 
1992,” Section 66 of RA 9136 or the “Electric Power Industry 
Reform Act (EPIRA),” and Rule 29 of the EPIRA-IRR
million. On a per fund type basis, EF had the 
most projects approved with 492 amounting to 
PhP 333.59 million. DLF follows with 40 projects
(equivalent to PhP 135.64 million) while the
36 RWMHEEF projects amounted to PhP 97.63
million. In 2011, 372 projects were approved 
by the Department which was equivalent to PhP 
288.38 million (Table 73). 
The various projects supported by the DLF 
component of ER 1-94 for first half of 2012
includes infrastructure and support facilities 
construction (road, rural health unit, legislative 
building, seawall/riprap, street extension, 
drainage system, dump site, arc and sidewalk 
pavement, bridge, school, administration 
building, sports facility, eco-park), procurement 
of vehicle and equipment, livelihood (catering 
entrepreneurship, rubber tree agro-forest, 
carabao dispersal, rag making, tricycle rent-toown) and street lighting. Said projects are to 
be implemented in Ifugao, Isabela, Zambales, 
Pangasinan, Batangas, Rizal, Albay, Sorsogon, 
Laguna, Quezon, Cebu, Leyte and Bukidnon.
In 2011 DLF funded projects include 
construction and enhancement of support 
infrastructures (barangay road, materials 
recovery facility or MRF, renovation/
extension of covered court, road concreting), 
procurement of vehicle and equipment 
(service vehicle, dump trucks, motor boat 
engine), livelihood programs (sagwan/
banca, local carabao, free range chicken 
and native chicken dispersal programs) and 
streetlighting. These 
projects are mostly to be 
implemented in Quezon, 
Batangas, Leyte, Negros 
Oriental and North 
Cotabato.

For the period in review, RWMHEEF-supported
projects include water system, purchase of 
health equipment (birthing, sewerage treatment, 
medical, automated biochemistry analyser, 
x-ray accessories, microscope, abdominal 
instrument, electrolyte analyser, haemoglobin 
analyser, dental chair and blood pressure 
monitoring apparatus), construction of health 
center, reforestation, solid waste management 
(acquisition of dump truck), purchase of 
ambulance and sanitation (construction of 
public toilet). These projects are in Nueva 
Vizcaya, Ifugao, Isabela, Pangasinan, Batangas, 
Antipolo, Quezon, Albay, Leyte, Bukidnon, Lanao 
del Sur and Sarangani. 
Common projects funded through RWMHEEF in
2011 involve health and sanitation (construction 
of health center, purchase of ambulance and 
e-mobile clinic), solid waste management 
(acquisition of garbage truck/dump truck, 
construction of perimeter fence in dump site), 
irrigation system, fire fighting system and
construction of support infrastructures (multipurpose hall/day care center). Said projects are 
to be implemented in Zambales, Bataan, Albay, 
Laguna, Quezon, Batangas and Leyte.
As part of project management and to ensure 
that accruing financial benefits from generating
facilities are accounted, the DOE has opened a 
total of 633 trust accounts from the inception 
of ER 1-94 up to June 2012. A total of 25 trust
accounts were opened in the first half of 2012
while in 2011, 48 were opened.
The establishment of trust accounts for 
generating facilities, generation companies 
and/or energy resource developers is stipulated 
in Rule 29, Section 5 of the EPIRA-IRR, which
states that “the DOE shall establish trust account 
specific for EF, DLF, RWMHEEF in the name of the 
DOE and the generation facilities or generation 
company and/or energy resource developer.” 
Section 7 of Rule 29, likewise specifies that “the 
administration of EF, DLF, RWMHEEF shall be 
undertaken by the Department.” Funds drawn 
from the electricity sales of generation facilities, 
generation companies and/or energy resource 
developers are used for projects under EF, DLF 
and RWMHEEF. As part of its mandate, the
DOE conducted inspection and assessment of 
82 electrification and 22 non-electrification
projects in the first half of 2012 to monitor
the progress of LGUs or proponents on their 
respective project implementation. In 2011, 
this was carried out to 44 electrification and 44
non-electrification projects. Moreover, in 2010,
50 electrification and 40 non-electrification
projects were inspected and assessed. 
Development Challenges
Based on consultations with various 
stakeholders, following were the issues raised 
concerning the benefits to host communities:
(a) review of ER 1-94 provisions to make it 
more responsive to emerging issues such as 
percentage sharing scheme of the three (3) 
components; identification of project evaluation
criteria; and, resolution of geographic boundary 
issues with DILG to address claims and 
disputes among adjacent host communities; (b) 
promotion of transparency and simplification
in the process of availing ER 1-94 funds and 
explore the possibility of the direct release of 
LGU shares to the host communities; and (c) 
conduct of regular multi-stakeholder dialogue to 
promote social acceptability of energy projects 
and raise awareness on their ER 1-94 accrued 
benefits.
Plans and Programs
In the short to medium term, the following 
action plans will be carried out: (a) review of 
the percentage allocation scheme of ER 1-94 
components especially for highly urbanized 
areas; (b) enhancing and streamlining the 
evaluation and approval process for projects 
funded by ER 1-94; (c) regular IEC campaign on 
ER 1-94 to concerned energy stakeholders; and, 
(d) constant coordination with DILG and other 
concerned agencies.Alternative Fuels
The critical role of alternative energy fuels is 
never more apparent than now as the country 
faces a rising demand for energy and a clamor 
to mitigate climate change. Accordingly, 
government’s policies and programs on 
alternative energy are geared towards weaning 
the country from its dependence on highly 
volatile oil import, and diversifying from 
conventional fuels to indigenous renewable and 
more environment-friendly energy resources 
that can contribute to the achievement of goals 
related to climate change. 
Following the passage of R.A. 9367 or the 
Biofuels Act of 2006, as well as developments 
in the use of Compressed Natural Gas and AutoLPG, the government will embark on attaining 
long-term sustainability in alternative energy 
supply, development and utilization. 
Performance Assessment
Biofuels Program
The passage of R.A. 9367, “An Act to Direct the 
Use of Biofuels, Establishing for this Purpose the 
Biofuels Program, Appropriating Funds thereof, 
and for other Purposes,” otherwise known as the 
“Biofuels Act of 2006” is a major policy leap in 
harnessing the country’s domestic alternative 
energy resources. More than revitalizing the 
country’s coconut and sugar industries, the law 
has provided more livelihood opportunities 
and higher incomes to farmers and the rural 
population in the countryside. The development 
of marginalized and idle lands also resulted in 
promotion of agribusiness and other potential 
investments in rural areas. 
Program Development (Evaluation, 
Accreditation and Monitoring)
As of first semester of 2012, the DOE has
accredited 13 biofuel producers (nine (9) for 
biodiesel and four (4) for bioethanol) and 
issued three (3) Certificates of Registration
with Notice to Proceed to three (3) bioethanol 
proponents. It has also endorsed 48 projects/
companies to the Securities and Exchange 
Commission for corporate registration and to 
the Board of Investments (BOI) for applicable 
incentives under the Biofuels Law. 
The nine (9) biodiesel producers as monitored 
by the DOE have a combined production capacity 
of 392.6 million liters per year. In terms of 
market demand, the total biodiesel (CME) blend 
sales declined to 122.5 million liters in 2011
from 124.5 million liters in 2010. The decline in
sales can be attributed to the high cost of diesel 
fuel in the petroleum market. Actual diesel fuel 
displacement from biodiesel sales in 2010 and 
2011 can be translated to equivalent foreign 
exchange savings of US$ 70.74 million and US$ 
94.96 million, respectively. During the first
semester of 2012, biodiesel sales already stood 
at 67.0 million liters with equivalent foreign 
exchange savings of US$ 54.16 million.83 
On the other hand, the Leyte Agri Corporation, 
the country’s first ethanol facility and San
Carlos Bioenergy Inc., Southeast Asia’s first
dedicated ethanol distillery with an integrated 
co-generation power plant,84 have a combined 
production capacity of up to 49 million liters of 
ethanol annually. Both ethanol plants decreased 
their total sales from 9.2 million liters in 2010 to 
2.9 million liters in 2011. Such significant decline
in sales was the result of the increasing price of 
sugarcane feedstock and the escalating price of 
ethanol-blend gasoline. In first half of 2012, total
sales boost up again to 20.7 million liters. Sales 
of local ethanol production could be translated 
to equivalent foreign exchange savings of US$ 
5.28 million in 2010, US$2.17 million in 2011
and US$ 15.81 million in first semester of 2012
from gasoline displacement.85 In addition, Roxol

Bioenergy Corporation, the 3rd bioethanol plant 
in the country located in the province of Negros 
Occidental, started its commercial operation in 
June 2011. Said plant has a total production 
capacity of 30 million liters annually.
Further, in August 2012, the DOE accredited the 
Green Future Innovation, Inc., which is located in 
the province of Isabela. Said plant has a capacity 
to produce about 54 million liters of bioethanol
annually. Similarly, by 2013, additional two (2) 
ethanol facilities with a combined annual capacity 
of 79.4 million liters will be available with the 
awarding of Certificate of Registration with
Notice to Proceed to Cavite Biofuels Producers 
Inc., and Canlaon Alcogreen Agro Industrial Corp. 
On 06 February 2011, the DOE issued D.C. No. 
2011-02-0001 titled “Mandatory Use of Biofuels 
Blend.” Beginning 06 August 2011, the said D.C. 
has increased the blend of bioethanol to 10.0 
percent. This transition period shall allow 
all oil companies to put in place appropriate 
adjustments including blending methodologies 
andfacilitiesattheir respectiverefineries,depots
and blending facilities that are in accordance 
with duly accepted international standards and 
the Philippine National Standards (PNS).
Research and Development Support 
To serve the technical requirements of the 
program and ensure continuous research and 
development, the DOE provided counterpart 
funding of PhP 50.00 million for the
establishment of a vehicle testing facility located 
at the Department of Mechanical Engineering 
Laboratory, UP-Diliman, Quezon City. Roundtable 
discussions with stakeholders on technical 
verification and relevance of emerging biofuel
technologies are also integral part of the DOE’s 
initiatives on research and development. 
Policy Issuances 
With the goal of sustaining the growth of the 
alternative fuels sector and improving governance, 
the following policy issuances were effected, to 
wit: (a) D.O. 2007-05-006 instituting the National 
Biofuels Program; (b) Joint Administrative Order 
(JAO) No. 2008-1, Series of 2008, prescribing 
the Guidelines Governing the Biofuel Feedstock 
Production and Biofuels and Biofuel Blends 
Production, Distribution and Sale under R.A. 9367;
(c) D.C. 2009-02-0002 mandating a “Minimum 
of 2.0 Percent Blend of Biodiesel in all Diesel and 
5.0 percent Bioethanol in Annual Total Volume of 
Gasoline;” and, (d) Memorandum Circular (M.C.) 
No. 184, “Directing All Departments, Bureaus, Offices 
and Instrumentalities of the Government, including 
Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations, 
to Incorporate the Use of Ten Percent Bioethanol by 
Volume in their Gasoline Requirements.” 
Among the provisions of the JAO is the creation 
of a One-Stop-Shop for the biofuels investors. 
The One-Stop-Shop, to be established within the 
premises of the Sugar Regulatory Administration 
(SRA) in Diliman, Quezon City, will consolidate 
the services of the National Biofuels Board 
(NBB) member agencies to ensure smooth 
and harmonized assistance to its clientele. 
The creation of NBB was mandated under the 
Biofuels Act of 2006 with the primary task to 
monitor and evaluate the implementation of the 
National Biofuels Program. 
The DOE also conducted consultations with 
biofuel producers, oil companies, member 
agencies of the NBB and other concerned 
institutions with regard to various policy 
initiatives such as Guidelines on Production, 
Storage and Sale of Biofuels,”“Revenue Regulations 
on the Sale of Locally-Produced Biofuels,” and 
“Guidelines on the Social Amelioration Welfare 
Program for Coconut Workers under the Biofuels 
Law.” Likewise, coordination with the PIA 
was undertaken on the development of a 
comprehensive information and communication 
plan for alternative fuels.
Natural Gas Vehicle Program for Public 
Transport (NGVPPT)
As of June 2012, seven (7) bus operators have 
been accredited for CNG bus operation. Of the 61 CNG public utility buses already in the country, 
41 are now plying the routes of Southern Luzon 
and Metro Manila. Additional six (6) buses had 
complied with the requirements for the issuance 
of safety certificates as of February 2011.
Technical inspection and on-road performance 
testing runs have been conducted for the other 
remaining CNG buses. The CNG Mother-refueling 
Station and the Daughter Station are operating in 
Batangas and Biñan, Laguna, respectively. 
One (1) CA was issued to KL CNG Bus Transport 
Corporation in June 2011. Technology 
assessment of refueling station equipment of 
Intermech was also conducted and the training 
of CNG drivers from HM Transport, Inc. and
Greenstar Express on CNG fuel and CNG bus 
operation was observed.
Auto-LPG Program
In 2011, there were about 19,052 converted taxi 
vehicles nationwide running on LPG from 17,500
units in 2010.86 The increase in converted 
vehicles was complemented by 219 auto-LPG 
dispensing stations (67 garage-based). 
In support to the Auto-LPG Program of the 
government, the Development Bank of the 
Philippines (DBP) has included auto-LPG 
initiative in its “Clean Alternative Transport Fuel 
Financing Program,” which provides reasonable 
financing package for auto-LPG related activities
such as acquisition of auto-LPG vehicles. The 
LTFRB also extended the number of years of 
franchise for taxis that converted to auto-LPG 
by two (2) years (e.g. from original franchise 
contract of 13 years plus the extension of 2 
years). These schemes promoted large scale 
conversion of taxi fleets and encourage new
player participation in the program.
On the other hand, the DOE and the Department 
of Trade and Industry-Bureau of Product 
Standards (DTI-BPS) in cooperation with other 
concerned agencies, private sector and Technical 
Committees on Cylinders, Road Vehicles and
86 Source: LTFRB
Refueling Stations have developed three (3) 
sets of standards for the implementation of 
the autogas industry, namely: (1) Road Vehicles 
- Automotive LPG components – Containers; 
(2) Approval of specific equipment of motor 
vehicles using liquified petroleum gases in their 
propulsion system and approval of a vehicle fitted 
with specific equipment for the use of liquified 
petroleum gases in its propulsion system with 
regard to the installation of such equipment; and, 
(3) Auto-LPG Dispensing Service Stations.
Several IEC activities on the Safety Rules 
and Regulations on the Use of Auto-LPG were 
conducted in the cities of Cebu, Davao, Iloilo, 
Cagayan De Oro, Naga, Palawan and Cebu to 
educate the general public and to promote autoLPG as a legitimate, effective, and safe alternative 
fuel. These undertakings were organized by the 
DOE in cooperation with DTI-BPS, Department 
of Transportation and Communication-Land 
Transportation Office (DOTC-LTO), Department
of Interior and Local Government-Bureau of 
Fire Protection (DILG-BFP), and Department of 
Science and Technology (DOST).
E-Vehicle Program
The EV technology is being demonstrated in 
various cities and municipalities Makati, Taguig, 
Mandaluyong, Quezon, Puerto Princesa, Davao 
and Surigao del Norte. In September 2011, the 
DOE participated in the APEC Energy Policy 
Roundtable and the Joint Transportation and 
Energy Ministerial Conference in California, 
USA in which one of the major goals is to 
move the APEC member countries87 towards a 
sustainable, energy efficient and low-carbon
transport future. The DOE emphasized the 
government initiatives to scale-up the EV 
Program and promote its importance in reducing 
the country’s vulnerability to oil price hike and 
carbon emission. 
 
87 APEC member economies are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, 
China, Hong Kong-China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, 
Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, 
Russia, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand, United States of 
America and Vietnam
The DOE regularly conducts monitoring as well 
as promotion of EV technology in the country. 
To date, 623 of various types of EV are being 
demonstrated nationwide. In January 2012, the 
DOE launched its “Bright Now! Do Right. Be Bright. 
Go E-trike!” Design-an-Electric Tricycle contest 
to encourage and promote the creativity and 
innovativeness of young Filipinos in crafting the 
Philippine version of the so called “Green Vehicle.” 
In March 2012, and 10 winners were awarded by 
the DOE out of 180 entries that competed. 
Other Emerging Technologies
As part of its continuing R&D on alternative fuels, 
the DOE conducted promotion, demonstration 
and technical presentations of hybrid engine 
technology in educational institutions such as 
the Technological University of the Philippines 
(TUP), University of Perpetual Help System
in Laguna and De La Salle University (DLSU), 
among others. Other initiatives include the 
development and utilization of hydrogen (fuel 
cells) and solar-powered vehicles. 
Measurable Sectoral Targets 
“30.0 Percent (30%) of all Public Utility 
Vehicles (PUVs) Nationwide running on 
Alternative Fuels by 2030”
Realizing the potential contribution of 
alternative fuels to help reduce the country’s 
economic cost from importing fossil fuel and 
promote clean energy, the government will 
accelerate the development of alternative fuels 
over the planning horizon. With the goal of 
transforming 30.0 percent 
of all PUVs running fully on 
conventional fuels into Public 
Utility Alternative FueledVehicles (PUAFVs), the DOE 
has a comprehensive set of 
targets for various potential 
alternative fuels which can 
be utilized, adopted and 
introduced in the country. 
 
Biofuels
The favorable policy environment now in place in 
terms of program development and fiscal regime
will result in a steady influx of investments in
the biofuels industry. By 2015, the government
targets the 5.0 percent biodiesel blend in the
market, in coordination with the NBB and with 
due consideration on supply availability, price 
and quality of biodiesel including blending, 
infrastructure and logistics. With diesel demand 
of 7,343.1 million liters (6,224.8 KTOE), the 5.0
percent blend is expected to displace around 
367.2 million liters (300.9 KTOE) of fuel. By 2020, 
the blend will increase to 10.0 percent displacing 
a total of 792.3 million liters (649.4 KTOE) of 
diesel fuel. And with mandated blend to further 
accelerate to 20.0 percent blend by 2025, fuel
displacement will reach about 1,738.8 million 
liters (1,425.0 KTOE) and 1,806.1 million liters
(1,480.3 KTOE) in 2030. Correspondingly, given 
the aggregate production capacity of existing 
biodiesel, the 10.0 percent blend will require 
10 additional biodiesel plants by 2020, while 
the 20.0 percent blend by 2025 will necessitate
additional 20 plants. Meanwhile, a total of 33 
additional biodiesel plants will be required for 
the entire planning period to cater for the supply 
and demand of the said fuel. Each of the required 
additional biodiesel plant will have a capacity of 
about 44 million liters per annum. Considering 
the supply availability and price, the blend may 
be further increased beyond 2030 (Table 74). 
On the other hand, the nationwide 10.0 percent 
bioethanol blend by volume into all gasoline 
fuel commenced in 2011 will have equivalent

 Aggregate annual capacity of existing accredited biodiesel plants = 423.62 million liters 
Annual capacity of each required bioethanol plant = 44 million litersfuel displacement of 373.1 million liters (208.6 
KTOE) and 379.5 million liters (212.2 KTOE) in
2012 and 2015, respectively (Table 75). 
By 2020, bioethanol blend will 
further increase to 20.0 percent 
displacing about 860.4 million 
liters (481.2 KTOE) to reach 
936.6 million liters (523.8
KTOE) and 1,010.5 million liters
(565.1 KTOE) in 2025 and 2030,
respectively. 
Meanwhile, six (6) additional bioethanol 
producing plants with capacity of 30 million 
liters per annum will be needed by 2012/2013 to 
address the supply requirement. Additional 20 
bioethanol plants will be required from 2020 to 
2030 for the 20.0 percent increase in blend. As 
an aspirational goal, the DOE is also considering 
the availability of 85.0 percent (E85) ethanol
blend by 2025 which will be promoted on a
voluntary basis. The introduction of E85 blend
will be dependent on the availability of local 
bioethanol supply, price, blending infrastructure 
and logistics, and flexi-fuel
vehicle technology. 
In terms of plant production 
capacity, additional two 
(2) bioethanol plants are 
targeted to be operational 
within the planning 
period. The Cavite Biofuels 
Producers Inc. with 34.4 
million liters of production 
capacity, and the Canlaon 
Alcogreen Agro Industrial 
Corp with 45.0 million liters of production
capacity are expected to start producing in 
2013 (Table 76). The total combined capacity 
of these plants which is about 79.4 million liters 
will increase the aggregate local bioethanol 
production capacity to 212.4 million liters in 
2013. This would include the production capacity 
of 54 million liters of the newly accredited Green
Future Innovation, Inc. Said increase in supply 
will facilitate in meeting the expected increase in 
blend set under the Biofuels Law. 
CNG
CNG Buses 
The DOE will strengthen 
its implementation of 
the NGVPPT given the 
environmental benefits
of CNG. There are 61 
CNG buses deployed in 
Luzon to jumpstart the 
commercial phase of 
the program. With the 
availability of critical

 (4) CNG Taxi Refilling Station is anchored on the Target Refilling Stations of CNG Buses
and facilities in the regions outside Luzon 
in 2014-2018, CNG buses are seen to start 
operations in the Visayas by 2020 with around 
100 CNG buses to be fielded (Table 78).
Consequently, 400 CNG buses will ply around in 
Mindanao by 2020. Nationwide, the number of 
CNG buses is targeted to reach 15,000 units by
2030, which will require about 150 refueling/
refilling stations all over the country.
The DOE has also enjoined the support of PNOC 
to put up CNG refilling stations, which are
targeted to be in place by 2013-2015.
CNG Taxis 
Over the planning period, the DOE is introducing 
the use of CNG for taxis. On the assumption that 
critical infrastructure for natural gas will be in 
place by 2016-2017 and fuel availability will 
be seen in Visayas and Mindanao, the DOE is 
targeting to deploy 100 units of CNG Taxis for 
its initial phase. This will displace a total of 0.9 
million liters of gasoline fuel. From 2020 to 
2025, the number of CNG taxi will be increased
from 1,000 to 6,000 units displacing a total of 9.4 
million liters to 56.3 million liters of gasoline,
respectively. By 2030, total CNG taxi is expected 
to reach about 16,000 units which will displace a 
total of 150.2 million liters of gasoline. However,
said program will be highly dependent on the 
availability of fuel supply, price, infrastructure 
and logistics as well as supporting policies, and 
concrete financial scheme for stakeholders.
Auto-LPG
Auto-LPG Taxis 
LPG is considered as one of the cleanest fuels in 
the market. With an increase in demand of autoLPG for vehicles by 2012, the DOE is anticipating 
that taxis converted to auto-LPG will reach about 
19,300 units nationwide. By 2020, it is expected 
to increase to 21,700 units, which would require 
a total of 271 refilling stations. This will displace
a total of 203.8 million liters of gasoline fuel. 
However, starting 2027, the total number of
auto-LPG is seen to decrease gradually with 
23,400 units from 23,500 units in 2026. The
gradual decrease in number of auto-LPG units 
can be attributed to the dropping of the 15-year
Franchise Contracts88 issued by LTFRB to AutoLPG Operators. Said contracts also provided for 
the shift to CNG taxi. By 2030, the total number 
of auto-LPG taxis is expected to further reduce 
to about 23,000 units displacing a total of 216.0 
million liters and requiring a total of 294 LPG 
refilling stations nationwide (Table 79). 
E-Vehicle Program 
With a number of advantages to make e-vehicle 
a viable alternative to gas-powered transport, 
the DOE is now pushing for its nationwide 
utilization through the E-Vehicle Program. By 
2015, the DOE is targeting to have 50,170 units
of E-vehicles in commercial operation from 630 
e-trike units in 2011 that will reap a total of 62.8 
88 Issuance of 13-year Franchise Contract by LTFRB to Auto-LPG 
Operators started in 1996 with an extension of another 2-year 
Contract that will last until 2011

will further increase to 106,000 units which will 
require about 85.6 MW of power, and displacing
a total of 132.7 million liters of gasoline fuel. 
By 2030, the total number of EVs is expected 
to reach 230,000 units equivalent to a gasoline 
displacement of 288.0 million liters and a total 
power requirement of 185.7 MW (Table 80).
The EV Program is initially anchored on the 
E-Trike Program under the ADB Loan Assistance 
Program. The targeted EVs for the program will 
be generally e-tricycles but this will be followed 
by e-jeepneys if concrete financial scheme and
incentive package will be available for investors.
If the required infrastructure and logistics 
will be available, the government targets the 
commercial operation of EVs by 2012 onwards. 
Development Challenges
The use of alternative fuels is seen as a major 
contributor to the mainstream development for the 
country. In this regard, the government recognizes 
that policies and programs on the promotion of 
alternative fuels must also address the economic 
and social impacts of its use and development. 
Biofuels
· Need to instill public awareness on 
the potential benefit of biofuels to the
environment, energy security and rural 
development ; 
· Ensuring supply security to support an 
increase in bioethanol blend; and,
· Deployment of biofuel compliant vehicles and 
readiness to utilize higher biofuel blend.
CNG
· Fuel availability and necessary infrastructure 
i.e. refueling stations to meet increasing 
demand for CNG buses; and,
·	 High upfront costs for infrastructure.
Auto-LPG
· Supply and pricing issues on the use of LPG 
for transportation and household.

· Lack of technical capabilities in the operation 
and maintenance of EVs; and,
· Need for public awareness and acceptance.
Plans and Programs
Over the planning period, the DOE will push for 
the implementation of the Fueling Sustainable 
Transport Program (FSTP). The said program 
will integrate and harmonize efforts of 
government into one comprehensive program 
to help mitigate impact of increasing oil price, 
lessen the country’s dependence from oil, and 
encourage the shift of petroleum/diesel-fed 
vehicles to low and zero-emission vehicles. The 
program is also in consonance with the National 
Environmentally Sustainable Transport Strategy 
(EST) for the Philippines89 which is a program of 
DOTC.
Biofuels
The DOE will intensify the promotion on the 
development and use of biofuels. It will create 
market awareness for alternative energy 
projects in collaboration with various industry 
stakeholders. In addition, the government will 
secure funding requirements to undertake 
tests and studies including procurement of test 
vehicles. Likewise, the necessary manpower 
89 National Environmentally Sustainable Transport (EST) Strategy 
for the Philippines was created by DOTC under Administrative 
Order (A.O.) 254 and launched on 20 May 2011. The program’s 
main goals are to reduce the annual growth rate of energy 
consumption and associated GHG and air pollutant emissions 
from the urban transport sector, and enhance sustainable 
mobility through the development of a viable market and shift to 
low emissions transport of goods and services (source: Clean Air 
Portal)
capability building will be undertaken to develop 
relevant knowledge and skills in implementing 
the Biofuels Program.
The DOE will continue to forge partnership with 
the academe and research institutions for the 
conduct of on-road performance and durability 
tests and market viability for higher biofuels 
blend for vehicles; use of up to 100 percent 
biodiesel for power and marine transport; 
viability study for other potential feedstock for 
biofuels; and life cycle analysis and technology 
road mapping. Introducing higher biofuels 
blend – up to 20.0 percent for biodiesel and 20.0 
percent to 85.0 percent for bioethanol – would
be contingent with the availability of supply. 
Implementing biodiesel blend for power and 
marine transport will be pursued in consultation 
with the concerned stakeholders.
Further, the government will broaden the 
coverage of the Biofuels Program to include 
other possible feedstocks. As such, technoeconomic studies on algae as potential biodiesel 
feedstock and the use of cellulosic technologies 
for the production of bioethanol will be pursued, 
CNG
As the transport sector is heavily dependent 
on traditional fuel, the use of CNG could reduce 
such reliance, as well as provide economic and 
environmental benefits for the country.
The target of around 1,192 million DLE 
displacement from 15,000 CNG buses by
2030 can be fast tracked by enhancing the 
policy directives on NGVPPT/supply and price 
mechanisms, and ensure gas supply for the 
NGVPPT commercial phase. 
Among the targets of the government to 
intensify the use of natural gas in the transport 
sector is to promote the CNG Conversion/
Retrofitting Technology and develop manpower
expertise/technical capability for regulators/
implementers. To encourage private sector 
participation, incentives are provided through the policy issuance of Executive Order 396, 
“Reducing the Rates of Import Duty on Compressed 
Natural Gas Motor Vehicles and Natural Gas 
Vehicle Industry - Related Equipment, Parts and 
Components Under Section 104 of the Tariff and 
Customs Code of 1978 (Presidential Decree No. 
1464), As Amended.” 
In terms of the development of the natural gas 
industry, the DOE will advocate for the passage of 
the Natural Gas Bill to support the CNG program 
for transport and to make it more competitive 
with other fuels.
Auto-LPG Program
The government is pushing for a wider utilization 
of LPG from household to the transport sector 
since LPG has the same positive environmental 
advantage as the other alternative energy. Thus, 
the DOE will enhance its policy direction on the 
use of LPG utilization and conduct studies on its 
effect to the transport vis-a-vis household, the 
pricing mechanism and regulation, as well as on 
importation and taxes. The DOE will likewise 
formulate policy directions and facilitate 
development of standards for the two/four 
stroke motorcycle engine, motorized bancas 
and other diesel engines.
In addressing the technical issues on the autoLPG program, the DOE will conduct technology 
validation for dual fuel jeepneys and other 
motorized diesel/gas engines and develop 
manpower expertise and capability building for 
regulators and implementers.
On the other hand, the DOE will undertake 
continuous IEC activities to ensure that 
concerned individuals and stakeholders 
are informed on the benefits derived from
the said Program. Also, the DOE will create 
market awareness for alternative energy 
projects in collaboration with various industry 
stakeholders.
E-Vehicle Program 
In support of the E-Vehicle Program, the DOE 
will formulate policies that provide incentives 
to encourage investment on Alternative Fuel 
Vehicles (AFVs). During the planning period, 
the DOE will also develop safety standards to 
facilitate the utilization of electric vehicles. 
Further, the DOE together with LGUs will devise 
counterpart supportive measures to expand 
the use of EVs among cities and provinces in 
the country. Similarly, IEC activities will be 
intensified to ensure that the program will be
well promoted nationwide. 
Emerging Alternative Fuels Technologies
The integration of new and emerging alternative 
fuels technologies is seen as one of the 
viable options to address the economic and 
environmental issues concerning the use of 
fuel oil. For the planning period, the DOE will 
conduct demonstration and deployment of 
electric, hybrid, hydrogen (fuel cell) and solar 
vehicle technologies. 
To meet these targets, the following activities 
will be undertaken:
• Formulate policy direction;
• Promote local and international cooperation 
(MOUs/MOAs); 
• Continue partnership with private sector 
and academe;
• Develop capability building programs (study 
tours, seminars and conferences);
• Establish demonstration testing, evaluation 
and assessment of technologies; and, 
• Encourage investments for emerging 
alternative energy technologies.
Energy Efficiency and Conservation

Amidst indicators and realities of high oil prices 
and greater competition for energy resources on 
a long-term basis, it is necessary for government 
to pursue greater efforts to temper the demand 
for energy. With parallel relationship between 
economic growth and energy use, government 
needs to find ways on how to utilize less energy
without sacrificing the country’s development
and quality of life of the people. Unless profound 
changes are introduced on the manner by which 
energy is used, the country will be demanding 
more energy than it can possibly import and 
produce.
Energy efficiency and conservation program
is a crucial component of a sound national
energy plan. In the long term, efficiently
managing our energy use will not only support 
economic growth, but will also be beneficial
to the environment by reducing greenhouse 
gas emission. However, realizing such benefits
would require aggressive effort on technology 
development and lifestyle change.
With the launching of the National Energy 
Efficiency and Conservation Program (NEECP)
in August 2004, the energy sector continues to 
work on the development and promotion of new 
technologies and the practice of sensible energy 
habits in our homes, businesses and motor 
vehicles. Thus, for the planning period, the DOE 
will strengthen the role of energy efficiency
and conservation as an all time solution to 
energy crisis brought by increasing demand and 
depleting energy resources. 
The gasoline lines of the 
‘70’s may be gone and our 
homes are comfortably 
cool in the hot summers 
of the tropics. But our 
energy sector today faces 
more challenges than it 
was years ago due to new 
developments in the world 
market.
Performance Assessment
Total energy savings generated increased by 
10.8 percent from the 2010 level of 3.7 MTOE 
to 4.1 MTOE in 2011. The increases in energy 
savings were obtained through initiatives being 
implemented under the NEECP which include 
the Energy Labeling and Efficiency Standards
and Energy Management Program (energy 
audits, recognition awards). During the first
semester of 2012, additional savings of 2.4 
MTOE are expected to be realized. The 2011 and 
2012 savings include the preliminary savings 
generated from the Philippine Energy Efficiency
Project (PEEP), particularly on the distribution 
of compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs). 
Social Mobilization and IEC Campaign
A key component to ensure success of the 
government’senergyefficiencyandconservation
program is the aggressive implementation 
of an effective IEC campaign. Currently, the 
energy sector promotes energy efficiency and
conservation through timely dissemination of 
basic information on energy standards, energy 
efficient products and innovative technologies.
IECs cover not only business operations and 
the supply/demand chain, but also intend 
to influence the consumers’ behavior. As
highlighted in the 2008 Philippine Energy 
Summit, the human factor is relevant in the 
success and widespread implementation of 
energy efficiency and conservation programs.The DOE also took advantage of the persuasive 
benefits of the tri-media campaign with 
the publication of enercon tips in major 
broadsheets, as well as the airing of television 
and radio advertisements over major 
television channels and KBP-member radio 
stations to reach greater consumer base in the 
residential and transport sectors. 
Among the activities carried out under the 
IEC campaign include seminar-workshops 
for target participants in the commercial, 
industrial, residential, and government, fuel 
economy run for transport vehicles, and the 
use of tri-media to reach wider target sectors. 
In 2011, the Department launched its Do 
Right, Be Bright campaign that aims to 
promote efficient energy use (DO RIGHT), as 
well as to educate and empower Filipinos to 
be smart energy users (BE BRIGHT) starting 
today (BRIGHT NOW!). The Campaign 
hinges on the three-fold agenda on Advocacy, 
Education and the DOE’s image as the “Energy 
Manager” of the Philippines. The DOE started 
the promotion of this new branding by 2012. 
Likewise, the DOE in partnership with the 
Development Academy of the Philippines (DAP) 
conducted a series of training-workshops 
on energy efficiency and conservation 
conceptualized for managers, supervisors 
and other stakeholders from the industry, 
commercial and transport sectors who are 
directly responsible in implementing energy 
conservation in their respective factories/
companies. The training-workshops, attended 
by over 1,000 participants, were conducted in 
the cities of Davao, Cagayan de Oro, Butuan, 
Dumaguete, Cebu, Bacolod, Iloilo, Naga, 
Baguio, La Union, Pampanga, Subic, Cavite and 
Laguna.
Energy Efficiency Standards and 
Labeling Program
Gains in energy efficiency will depend mostly on
technological improvements in basic household 
appliances and lighting productsThe use of 
energyefficient technologies will not only save
on energy use, but in cost as well.
The DOE, in partnership with the DTI, has 
effectively implemented the mandatory Energy 
Efficiency Standards and Labeling Program
for selected household appliances and lighting 
products such as room air conditioners, 
refrigerators (with storage volume of five (5)
cubic feet/142 liters to eight (8) cubic feet/227 
liters) and compact fluorescent lamps. The
labeling program ensures that consumers have 
the information they need to make the right 
decision when they purchase these household 
appliances and lighting fixtures. On the other
hand, energy standards weed out the inefficient
models before they reach the market. Likewise, 
the DOE has established the test facilities 
capable of validating the claimed ratings on the 
energy labels. The government is now on its 
way to further widen the scope of appliances 
and lighting products to be covered by energy 
standards and labeling. The development of 
relevant PNS is undertaken jointly by DOE and 
DTI, in consultation with the stakeholders such 
as the Philippine Appliance Industry Association 
and the Philippine Lighting Industry Association. 
The program helped the country save 2.1 MTOE in 
2010, further increasing to 2.3 MTOE by end-2011. 
For the first half of 2012, initial data show that
about 1.3 MTOE in savings have been generated. 
Lamp Waste Management Facility
To avert residual mercury from entering the 
food chain through landfill dumps leaching
into groundwater, a new mercury recycling 
plant for fluorescent lamps will be established.
The testing and recovery facility is designed to 
stimulate private sector interest in lamp waste 
management business. A form of Extended 
Producer Responsibility (EPR) shall be explored 
in coordination with the DENR and other 
government agencies and lighting industry 
associations. The mechanism requires that the 
manufacturers or importers become responsible 
for the cost of managing the spent lamps 
following the cradle-to-grave management
As part of incentives to private investors, the 
establishment of waste recycling facilities has 
been incorporated in the 2009 Investment 
Priorities Plan. Further, a shortlist of buyers 
of busted fluorescent lamps and organizations
accredited by the DENR to transport/treat/
recycle were undertaken. The establishment of a 
lamp waste management facility is a component 
of the PEEP funded by ADB. 
Philippine Efficient Lighting Market 
Transformation Project
As part of the advocacy program under 
the Philippine Efficient Lighting Market
Transformation Project, the DOE signed a 
MOA with the DILG and the Department of 
Public Works and Highways (DPWH) for the
implementation of the following guidelines by 
the local government units: i) Energy Conserving 
Design of Buildings, ii) Efficient Lighting, and
iii) Roadway Lighting Guidelines. 
Recognition Awards
The DOE also sustained the conduct of 
recognition awards – both local and regional – 
which commend efforts of private companies 
in implementing energy efficiency and
conservation program. These recognition 
awards also exemplified dynamic government
and private sector partnership. 
Don Emilio Abello Energy Efficiency Award 
(DEAEEA)
The Recognition Award acknowledges the 
initiatives of private companies and managers 
who have implemented energy efficiency
and conservation programs that resulted in 
considerable savings in energy cost. 
A total of 61 establishments from the industrial, 
commercial and transport groups were awarded 
in 2010. On the other hand, 39 individuals 
from private corporations were conferred 
as Outstanding Energy Managers in fitting
ceremonies held on 07 December 2010. The 
total savings realized by these companies was 
equivalent to 156.0 MMLOE amounting to PhP
5.0 billion with CO2
 avoidance of 269,000 tons. 
For 2011, 59 companies and 33 outstanding
energy managers were recognized under the 
DEAEEA. Through the initiatives of these 
awardees, significant savings of 92.0 MMLOE
were obtained for the year. This corresponds 
to PhP3.6 billion in monetary savings and 148.0 
tons of avoided carbon dioxide.
ASEAN Energy Awards: Best Practices 
Competition for Energy Management in 
Buildings and Industries
The ASEAN Energy Awards is considered as the 
most prestigious energy management contest in 
the ASEAN Region recognizing companies that 
demonstrate best practices on energy efficiency
and conservation. In 2010, the Market! Market! 
Mall in Taguig bagged the (Large) Building 
Category Award while the Philippine EPSON 
Optical Inc. of the Philippines won the (Large) 
Industry Award. In 2011, the winners were 
as follows: a) MERALCO Management and
Leadership Development Center (under the 
Small and Medium Building Category), b) J. 
P. Morgan Chase and Company (first runnerup under the Large Building Category, and c) 
Toshiba Information Equipment (Phils.), Inc. 
(Large Industry).
Government Energy Management 
Program (GEMP)
 With the intention of lowering the total energy 
consumption of the country, the government 
resolved to start in its own backyard. Thus, 
the GEMP was customized in September 2005
to help national government agencies reduce 
consumption of electricity, gasoline and diesel 
which will consequently trim down operating 
costs.
Under Administrative Order 126 issued in 
2004, government agencies are required to 
reduce annual consumption of electricity and gasoline by 10.0 percent based on their 2005
energy consumption. In support of this policy, 
there are 590 government offices submitting
their electricity and fuel consumption reports 
to DOE. Assessment and evaluation activities to 
validate said submissions are conducted by the 
DOE. Based on the Department’s consolidated 
reports, a total of PhP1.8 billion savings were 
obtained from September 2005 to December
2011. This is equivalent to around 206,931,528
kWh and 7.2 million liters savings in electricity 
and fuel, respectively.
On the other hand, the conduct of Energy Audit 
Spot Checks for various government institutions 
was revived to cover national government 
agencies, as well as its regional offices. As a
result, the DOE conducted spot checks of 63 
government agencies in 2010. Preparation 
of the energy spot check rating for efficient
use of electricity takes into consideration the 
compliance to several measures, such as the 
use of compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), room
setting temperature not lower than 25 degrees
centigrade, and setting of air-conditioners at fan 
mode during lunch breaks. On the other hand, 
gauging fuel efficiency relies on the agency’s
monthly fuel consumption record, preventive 
maintenance schedule of service vehicles, and 
implementation of a fuel conservation program.
As a whole, the GEMP was able to achieve 0.03 
MTOE in savings for 2010, while end-2011 
record saw this increasing to 0.04 MTOE. For the 
first semester of 2012, about 0.025 in savings
have been registered. 
Philippine Energy Efficiency Project 
(PEEP)
The PEEP has been conceived after the 2008 
Philippine Energy Summit for a calibrated 
phasing-out of inefficient technologies such
as the shift from incandescent bulbs to energy 
efficient lighting system. It has a sizeable
financing plan of US$ 46.5 million, where US$
31.1 million was funded under an ADB loan 
facility agreement, US$ 1.5 million from an ADB
grant, and US$ 14.0 million from the Philippine 
government as project counterpart fund. The 
project is designed to generate electricity savings 
of 264 GWh annually, as well as a deferred 
power capacity saving of 200.0 MW per year. It 
would also result in an environmental pollution 
reduction of 143,000 tons of CO2
 avoidance per 
year.90 Such savings will be obtained from the 
distribution of CFLs to the residential sector. 
The DOE targets the distribution of 5.0 million
CFLs for the period 2010 to 2011 and 3.6 million 
for 2011-2012. 
The PEEP shall address the transformation of 
the lighting market industry by introducing 
energy efficient lighting system such as the CFL
in the household and government buildings. It 
was likewise designed to reduce cost of power 
generation; establish sustainable business 
models for large-scale implementation of energy 
efficiency programs; establish a certification
process for energy and environmentally efficient
commercial buildings, among others.91
The Project will have the following outputs:92
(i) implementation of lighting retrofits in 35
selected government buildings nationwide; 
(ii) provision of 8.6 million CFLs to consumers 
(iii) implementation of energy-efficient
public lighting programs to include traffic
lights; (iv) expansion of testing laboratory 
capacity and establishment of a mercury waste 
management plant for fluorescent lighting; (v)
implementation of a certification scheme for
energy- efficient buildings; and (vi) development
and implementation of a communication and 
social mobilization program. 
In 2009, the distribution of five (5) million
CFLs (under Lot 1) was launched on 26 
September 2009 at the Don Bosco Technical 
School in Tondo, Manila. This signaled the CFL 
distribution in Metro Manila, CALABARZON, 
Bulacan and three (3) distribution utilities 
(Cagayan Electric Power and Light Company, 
90 ADB. Proposed Loan and Administration of Grant, RP: Philippine 
Energy Efficiency Project, January 2009, page 14
91 ibid, page 9
92 ibid
Visayas Electric Company and Davao Light 
and Power Corporation). In April 2010, two 
(2) million CFLs were re-allocated from Metro 
Manila to Mindanao to address the power supply 
constraint. And in 2011, a total of 2,554,605
CFLs were distributed in Metro Manila, Bulacan 
and some areas in CALABARZON, while about 
150,400 CFLs were allotted for the beneficiaries
of the National Housing Authority, Department
of Social Welfare and Development and the DOE. 
Meanwhile, 1,640,289 CFLs were shipped to 
Mindanao through the electric cooperatives and 
distribution utilities. Furthermore, 224,370 
CFLs were disseminated to large distribution 
utilities in Visayas and Mindanao. Thus total 
CFL distributed in 2011 was placed at 4,569,664
(Lot 1 of the project). The remaining balance 
of 430,336CFLs were further distributed in 
Mindanao during the first semester of 2012,
completing the targets under Lot 1 of the project. 
On the other hand, the distribution of 3.6 million 
CFLs (Lot 2) is targeted for completion by end2012 among Congressional districts nationwide.
On the PEEP component on Public Lighting 
Retrofit, Baguio City’s Burnham Park Complex 
and Wright Park were retrofitted with efficient
lighting system which is expected to save the 
city about 193.5 MWh per year or PhP 3.0
million in monetary savings and CO2
 reduction 
of 87.1 tons.
Meanwhile, the retrofitting of street lights in
Cagayan de Oro has shown potential energy 
savings of 900.7 MWh annually or about PhP 
9.0 million cost savings and reduction in CO2
emissions by 405.3 tons.
On the other hand, the PEEP component on
retrofitting of government office buildings
seeks to replace older model fluorescent lamps,
incandescent bulbs and inefficient magnetic
ballasts by energy efficient alternatives such
as the new T5 fluorescent lamps, CFLs and
electronic ballasts. As of December 2011, 10 
out of the 35 government buildings targeted
for retrofitting were validated to be completed.
These are the National Dairy Authority, 
Securities and Exchange Commission, National 
Housing Authority, Philippine Information
Agency, Department of Environment and 
Natural Resources, Environmental Management 
Bureau, Philippine Institute of Volcanology 
and Seismology, National Telecommunications 
Commission, Mines and Geosciences Bureau, 
and the National Food Authority. 
Measurable Sectoral Targets
The potential energy savings anchored on the 
sector’s goal of 10.0 percent savings on the total 
annual energy demand of all economic sectors 
is shown in Table 82. For the entire planning 
period, total cumulative savings is expected to 
reach 31,004 KTOE.
To meet these projected savings, the plans and 
programs of the PEP considered the ASEAN 
Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation (APAEC) 
2010-2015 specifically on the development of
President Benigno S. Aquino III and 
Secretary Jose Rene Almendras led the 
switch-on ceremony of CFL streetlights 
in Burnham Park, Baguio City on 19 
August 2011. This marked the full 
lighting retrofit of the park as witnessed 
by Cong. Bernardo M. Vergara, Baguio 
City Mayor Mauricio G. Domogan, 
Bishop Carlito J. Cenzon, and Neeraj 
Jain from the Asian Development Bank.clear policies on energy efficiency, awareness
raising and dissemination of information, 
promoting good energy management practices 
and facilitation of financing for energy efficiency
projects.
Development Challenges
One major challenge which was also raised 
during the conduct of the 2008 Philippine Energy 
Summit is the need for an Energy Conservation 
Law. It was identified as a critical measure
by government to effectively manage the 
energy demand of the country. In accordance 
with the Energy Summit results, the Energy 
Conservation Law should incorporate policies 
and measures to develop local energy auditors 
and energy managers, establish the ESCO 
industry, encourage the development of energy 
efficient technologies and provide incentives for
the effective promotion of efficiency initiatives
in the energy market sector.
Similar calls for the implementation of other 
energy efficiency and conservation measures
were echoed during the regional consultations 
of the PEP. Specifically, energy stakeholders
recommended that the following measures and 
initiatives be put in place during the planning 
period:
· Review existing policies on EE and C 
and integrate measures such as strict 
implementation of the Guidelines on Energy 
Efficient Design of Buildings to include the
use of passive cooling system. 
· Intensify enforcement and monitoring of 
Administrative Orders and Memorandum 
Circulars on Energy Efficiency and
Conservation (to include deputizing a 
specific agency and developing energy
champions in each agency), as well as 
providing incentives on energy efficiency
best practices. 
· Strict implementation of electrical product 
standards in the market and conduct of 
energy audits to cover other sectors.
· Encourage LGUs to implement their 
own energy efficiency and conservation
initiatives through the promulgation of local 
ordinances. 
· Expedite the preparation and implementation 
of Lamp Waste Management Policy.
· Establishment of ESCO’s as an emerging 
energy industry
Plans and Programs 
Uncertainties in the energy sector brought about 
by a confluence of factors such as world political
disorders and oil price hikes in the world market, 
invariably impact on the country’s economic 
growth and development which in turn affects 
government efforts to alleviate poverty. 
This Plan, formulated to sustain economic 
growth for the next 20 years, highlights the 
development of appropriate energy efficiency
and conservation policies and related programs 
on the rational use of energy. 
Over the short-term, the DOE will pursue the 
following programs to realize potential savings: 
Table 82. POTENTIAL ENERGY SAVINGS BY SECTOR (in KTOE)

Policy Formulation/Initiatives 
The DOE will expand existing policies on energy 
efficiencyandconservationtoensureremarkable
achievements in terms of implementation and 
compliance. For the planning period, the DOE 
will work for the passage of a comprehensive 
National Energy Conservation and Efficiency
Bill and the amendments to DOE Memorandum 
Circular 93-03-05 (Energy Consumption, 
Monitoring and Evaluation of Industrial, 
Commercial, Transport and Power Sectors).
The proposed Energy Conservation and 
Efficiency bill aims to promote the rational
use of energy across all sectors of the economy 
nationwide. It would incorporate policies, 
goals, directions, regulations and guidelines for 
the enforcement of a national energy efficiency
plan. Specifically, it would also include the
implementation of energy efficient design of
buildings and the use of passive cooling in 
commercial establishments as prescribed by 
the Guidelines on Energy Conserving Design 
of Buildings). It would also consider energy 
efficiency initiatives of the local government
units to ensure support at the grassroot 
levels.
On the other hand, the Department will 
introduce amendments to D.C. 93-03-05, which
requires the submission of quarterly energy 
consumption reports for companies consuming 
more than one (1) million liters of fuel oil 
annually and regular yearly reports for those 
consuming more than two (2) million liters of 
fuel oil annually to the DOE. Said amendments 
intend to expand the coverage to include 
medium enterprises with energy consumption 
of above 500,000 liters of oil equivalent annually,
as well as water transport vessels (cargo and 
passenger ships), power distribution utilities 
and power generation companies. In addition, 
an accreditation policy for Energy Managers 
and Energy Auditors will also be included under 
the Circular.
Promotion of Energy Service Companies (ESCO)
The promotion of private ESCO as a new business 
market industry model shall be pursued by the 
DOE. The underlying activities are the capacity 
building of all accredited private ESCOs and 
the preparation of the business plan to provide 
financing for energy efficiency projects to be
undertaken by these private ESCOs.
The assessment and accreditation of private 
ESCOs by the DOE is provided under D.C. 2008-
09-004 issued in 2008. As of first semester
2012, the DOE has 12 accredited ESCOs.
Foreign-Assisted Projects
The DOE is implementing two (2) foreignassisted projects as follows: 
(a) JICA Technical Assistance Project on the 
Developmental Study of Energy Efficiency 
and Conservation for the Philippines.
The objective of the study is to assist 
the Department in designing the Energy 
Conservation Bill and institutionalize 
energy efficiency and conservation
measures by providing the concept design 
of the said bill and its organizational 
structure. Other sub-components 
include the IEC campaign, a Training and 
Certification Program for Energy Auditors
and Energy Managers, and the full-scale 
National Energy Consumption Database 
and System Application Tool. During 
the first quarter of 2011, the first Study
Mission Team of JICA was dispatched to 
the country to gather information on the 
Department’s policy measures on EE&C, 
energy management system, energy audit 
scheme, energy database, labeling scheme 
and IEC activities. And in the first semester
2012, the Team completed its fifth and last
mission. A stakeholders’ meeting was 
conducted to gather recommendations 
and inputs from concerned agencies. As a 
result, the proposed Energy Conservation 
Bill has gained the endorsement of Congresswoman Maria Evita Arago (of the 
3rd District of Laguna) and Senator Teofisto
Guingona III. The bill was also presented 
to the Energy Committee of the House of
Representatives for comments.
(b) UNIDO-GEF Technical Assistance Project 
on the Philippine Industrial Energy 
Efficiency Project
During the first quarter of 2012, the
Department launched an Inception
Workshop on its new undertaking to 
bring the benefits of energy efficiency to
the industrial sector – one of the most 
energy intensive sectors of the economy.
The 5-year joint project of the DOE
and the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP) will be known as 
the Philippine Industrial Energy Project 
(PIEEP) which will promote industrial 
efficiency through introduction of energy
management and industrial energy 
systems optimization, capacity building 
of stakeholders - enterprises, equipment 
suppliers, engineering / energy service 
companies and government planners 
in implementing system level efficiency
improvements, and integration of energy 
efficiency into management systems of
industrial enterprises through energy 
management standards. The five-year
implementation of the PIEEP is expected 
to generate energy savings of 2,057,755
MWh.
The project’s main goal centers on the 
demonstration of an energy efficient
process through energy efficiency system
optimization and the establishments of
an Energy Management Standard for the 
Industrial sector based on International 
Standard Organization (ISO) 50001
framework. Currently, the Project 
Management Office is being organized in
anticipation of full project operation. 
The DOE will also continue to carry out its 
programs over the planning horizon, which 
have provided substantial energy savings for 
the country, namely: 
Demand Side Management (DSM) Program
The implementation of a DSM program will 
cover the following activities: a) promotion of 
energy efficient technologies in the industrial,
commercial, government buildings and 
household sectors; b) promotion of Light 
Emitting Diode (LED) technology for street 
lighting; c) promotion of Voluntary Agreement 
with private companies through a Pledge of 
Commitment, which could result in voluntary 
reduction of energy consumption; and d) 
expansion of the energy standards and labeling 
program to include other electrical appliances.
To ensure greater energy savings for the 
country, the DOE will introduce new initiatives 
(2011-2015). The DOE’s Energy Standard and
Labeling Program will be expanded to include 
new models of passenger cars and light duty 
vehicles. An appropriate governing body shall be 
established consisting of representatives from 
DOE, DTI, car manufacturers, consumers group, 
industry associations and other concerned 
stakeholders. The body will be tasked to oversee 
project implementation with priority given to 
securing support equipment and other related 
testing devices and modules. 
Likewise, the labeling program will involve 
the continuing conduct of energy performance 
testing of refrigerators (5 to 12 cubic feet),
compact fluorescent lamps, ballasts, linear/
circular fluorescent lamps, luminaires, high
intensity discharge lamps, freezers, industrial 
fans and blowers, television sets, beverage 
coolers, household electric fans, washing 
machines, audio/video equipment, and 
even vehicles. The DOE will conduct energy 
performance testing of these equipment and 
vehicles to verify compliance with energy 
standards and to validate its claimed energy 
performance.
Several other initiatives will be implemented 
for the planning period to enhance strategies 
on energy efficiency and conservation, which
include:
(a) 	 Certification program for Energy Manager
and Energy Auditor;
(b)	 Development of the Energy Efficiency and
Conservation Guidelines for residential 
buildings; 
(c) Development of energy benchmark for 
commercial and government buildings and 
industrial manufacturing facilities; and 
(d)	 Energy management for efficiency
performance monitoring of the power 
generation utilities and electric 
distribution facilities to include the heat 
rate improvement project of government 
Other concrete actions to support the target 
energy savings towards the end of the planning 
horizon will be set in place. The promotion of 
energy efficiency and conservation programs
will extend to other program initiatives such 
as: (a) Aviation Fuel Efficiency Enhancement,
(b) Major Retrofit of Commercial and Industrial
Sectors, (c) Voluntary Agreement Program with 
the LGU’s in support of the Rationalization of 
Tricycle Operation, (d) Promotion Technology 
on Fuel Efficient Vehicles and Lighting Systems.
Meanwhile, the development of an Energy 
Management Standard (EMS) for industrial 
establishments based on the ISO 50001
framework shall be jointly implemented by the 
DOE and DTI-BPS to ensure full compliance 
and success of the program. As a mandatory 
program, the EMS shall require the employment 
of an energy manager/auditor in an industrial 
facility. On the other hand, energy auditors 
working for energy service companies and 
other energy service providers shall be required 
to secure DOE accreditation after completing 
the training and certification program of the
Department.
Looking beyond the end of the long-term plan 
is the establishment of an Energy Conservation 
Center for the country, as a learning center 
showcasing an energy efficient building model
that will incorporate green technologies. 
The model shall exhibit new energy efficient
technologies (devices, equipment, appliances, 
electronic products, vehicles), as well as 
energy efficient local inventions. The DOE,
in partnership with concerned government 
agencies and academic institution shall be 
tasked to maintain and manage the operation of 
the Center in cooperation with various industry 
associations, equipment vendors/distributors, 
electric distribution utilities, oil companies and 
other stakeholders from the private and nongovernment sectors. Energy and Climate Change
The passage of the Climate Change Act of 2009 
highlighted the urgency of addressing climate 
change. It also became the policy anchor in the 
formulation of the National Framework Strategy 
on Climate Change (NFSCC) and the Philippine 
Strategy on Climate Change Adaptation 
(PSCCA) which were approved and adopted 
by the Government in April and August 2010, 
respectively. These national policies were further 
concretized into a long-term National Climate 
Change Action Plan of the Philippines (NCCAP) 
2011-2028 which was approved by President 
B. S. Aquino III in November 2011. NCCAP aims 
to institutionalize a low carbon trajectory and 
transition the economy into a climate smart 
development through a cohesive, integrated and 
harmonized approach at the national and subnational levels. Cognizant of its importance, 
the NCCAP became a cross-cutting topic in the 
Philippine Development Plan 2011-2016. 
As the biggest contributor to greenhouse gas 
emissions, the energy sector is one of the 
important components of the NCCAP. Under 
a Sustainable Energy Program Framework, 
the NCCAP has identified both mitigation and
adaptation measures that the energy sector can 
adopt to address impacts of climate change. 
SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
Mitigation 
Energy consumption and production contribute 
significantly to the accumulation of GHG and
air pollutants emissions to the atmosphere. As 
such, the energy sector ensures that policy and 
program mechanisms are in place to mitigate 
the impacts of global warming.
 
The energy sector component of the NCCAP is 
consistent with the targets and timelines of PEP 
2012-2030 in promoting renewable energy and 
energy efficient technologies as key elements of
attaining sustainable development through a low 
carbon path strategy. This strategy ensures the 
full-scale development and commercialization 
of renewable energy. An RE technology roadmap 
will enable the realization of NREP target to more 
than double the share of RE systems in power 
generation. Complementary to this initiative 
is an RE Research and Development Agenda 
to be pursued in collaboration with the state 
university-based Affiliated Renewable Energy
Centers (ARECs) of DOE as well as the science 
and technology community. While aiming for the 
increasing share of RE sources in the country’s 
total on-grid electricity supply, the decentralized 
RE systems, on the other hand, are seen to 
address the energy requirements of communities 
in off-grid areas. 
Meanwhile, a more intensified implementation
of the NEECP nationwide aims to reduce the fuel 
and electricity consumption of all the economic 
sectors of society: residential, transport, 
commercial, industrial and agriculture. The 
passage of the Energy Efficiency Law is targeted
to bring about the intensive promotion on 
the use of energy efficient technologies and a
massive values re-orientation campaign on the 
benefits of energy efficiency and conservation.
The tri-partite partnership network among 
government, private sector and the civil society 
has been identified by NCCAP as a major strategy
to scale-up and sustain the promotion efforts. 
Under the Sustainable Energy component of 
the NCCAP, likewise, the energy sector is also 
called upon to contribute to the attainment of an 
environmentally sustainable transport system. 
Among the sector’s programs to support this 
goal are the use of alternative transport fuels 
that are sourced from compressed natural gas, 
liquefied petroleum gas, biofuels (CME and E10)
and electricity; conduct of studies on higher 
biofuel blends, feasibility on the use of biofuels 
in other transport systems such as on air sea; 
and, feasibility on hybrid systems, e.g. fuel 
cells. A medium-term program likewise is the 
implementation of energy efficiency standards
and labeling for new vehicles. 
Development Challenges 
To pursue these mitigating measures, the 
following issues and concerns must be addressed: 
• Remove barriers to large-scale renewable 
and alternative energy development 
Development barriers to renewable 
energy include higher capital cost for 
most RE technologies, cost of transmission 
access, and off-take risks which constrain 
commercial bank financing. On the other
hand, the development of new biofuel 
production plants is being hampered by 
lack of early project development funding 
to cover feasibility studies and front-end 
engineering design.
• Need to mandate energy efficiency and
conservation 
The lack of an enabling legislation on energy 
efficiency and conservation restricts the
imposition of mandatory conservation 
measures, energy efficiency standards,
and other conservation and/or utilization 
targets. Energy efficiency still faces financing
barriers partly due to the invisibility of 
energy efficiency measures and difficulty in
demonstrating and quantifying results. 
• On Emissions and Emissions Reductions 
Reporting 
There is a need to account actual emissions 
and emissions reductions from contributing 
energy-consuming sectors. Thus, there is 
a need to develop a program on voluntary 
reporting of emissions and mitigation 
actions e.g. emission reduction projects and 
measures by the different sectors.
Action Plan
• Integration of climate change mitigation 
measures to energy policies, plans and 
strategies including laws and regulations;
• Development of Guidelines on Reporting of 
Emissions and Emission Reduction including 
capacity building in the establishment of 
reporting forms and database.
• Implementation of emission reduction 
programs, and projects;
• Sharing and dissemination of knowledge, 
research and best practices on mitigation;
• Development and adoption of sustainable 
financing mechanisms; and,
• Monitoring, reporting and evaluation 
systems of mitigation policies and measures. 
ADAPTATION 
The energy sector is considered as one of the 
vulnerable sectors that need to adapt to changing 
demand and supply conditions resulting from 
climate change such as increased temperature, 
sea level rise, and extreme weather events, 
(e.g. heavy precipitations, typhoons, landslides, 
and droughts). An equally daunting challenge 
is the adaptability of energy infrastructures 
such as power plants, refineries, depots, power
transmission and distribution systems, fuel 
distribution systems, and renewable energy 
systems to cope with these changing climatic 
conditions. Further, most energy infrastructures 
are located along coastal areas where impacts of 
sea level rise and coastal storm surges will likely 
occur. 
If there is insufficient capacity to meet increased
peak energy demand, the country could face a 
greater probability of brownouts and blackouts 
during the peak demand periods. Likewise, 
energy supply cut-off due to energy system 
operation interruptions/outages as results of 
extreme climatic events, e.g. typhoon, flood,
landslides can also incur serious economic
problems.
The long term goal under NCCAP is to mainstream 
adaptation in energy development projects by climate proofing of energy infrastructures and
systems to withstand extreme weather events 
and conditions.
Table 83 shows the initial risk assessment of the 
different energy systems using the preliminary 
climatic trends presented by the Philippine 
Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical 
Services Administration (PAG-ASA).
Development Challenges 
To pursue climate change adaptation measures 
in the energy sector, the following gaps and 
issues should be properly addressed: 
• Need to assess the energy infrastructures 
and systems’ vulnerability as well as 
pressures in energy demand and supply;

• Need to develop models on climate change 
impacts of weather extremes, seasonal 
variability, changes in temperature and 
wind speeds to assess their implication on 
energy supply resources, e.g. wind, solar 
and hydro as well as on energy consumption 
patterns.
Action Plan 
• Conduct of impact and vulnerability 
assessments of the energy systems and 
infrastructures, i.e. power generation, 
transmission and distribution, fuel 
production and transport;
• Integration of structural adaptations into 
the design of energy infrastructures and 
structural design strengthening;
• Implementation of infrastructure 
reinforcement measures such as:
o strengthening of power transmission 
and distribution systems, underground 
cabling for power distribution system;
o strengthening of fuel distribution 
systems, underground fuel pipeline 
distribution system;
o installation of infrastructure 
intervention e.g. sea walls/coastal 
defense; and,
o soil erosion control system.
• Mainstream climate change adaptation 
in energy policies, plans and programs 
including laws and regulations;
• Development of strategies to address 
changing demand patterns;
o Investment in technological change to 
address energy demand and supply 
options;
o Development and adoption of 
sustainable financing mechanisms;
• Sharing and dissemination of knowledge, 
research and best practices on adaptation.
DOE AS ENVIRONMENTAL 
MONITOR
As one strategy in ensuring continuous supply 
of energy, social and environmental safeguards 
should be in place prior to the development of 
any energy project.
Environmental compliance monitoring is 
regularly undertaken by DOE to ensure effective 
application of social and environmental 
safeguards. The most common mode being 
carried-out is through the multi-stakeholders 
monitoring commonly termed as Multipartite 
Monitoring Team (MMT). These activities 
are carried out with the following objectives: 
a) sharing of knowledge, experiences and 
provide recommendations to further enhance 
monitoring procedures; b) ensure compliance 
of project proponent with standards as 
stipulated in the Environmental Management 
Plan, Environmental Compliance Certificate
(ECC) conditions and other related permits; 
c) assist in harmonizing the relationship of 
all stakeholders to ensure public and social 
acceptability of energy projects; d) prepare, 
integrate and disseminate monitoring reports 
and submit recommendation to the DENR; and, 
e) monitor community information, education 
and communication activities.
The MMT is a required mechanism under the 
Philippine Environmental Impact Statement 
System. Its creation aims to encourage public/
stakeholders participation, and to provide 
appropriate check and balance mechanisms in 
compliance monitoring of development project 
implementation.
The MMT is composed of representatives of 
the proponent and of a broad spectrum of 
stakeholder groups including representatives from the local government units, nongovernment organizations, and peoples 
organizations, the community, the women’s 
sector and whenever necessary, the academic, 
relevant government agencies and other sectors. 
The MMT is operationalized through the 
formulation of an annualized monitoring plan

VII. INTERNATIONAL ENERGY COOPERATION
The energy policy framework being pursued by 
the Philippines aptly responds to the diversed 
requirements of the energy sector. The role of 
the government is of great consequence and 
magnitude that policies, plans and programs 
transcend the domestic arena. Under the banner 
“Energy Access for More,” development of energy 
policies is being fortified by the creation of an
environment which allows cooperation and 
dynamism with other countries.
To be globally competitive, the DOE anchors its 
ERA through the guideposts of energy security, 
optimal energy pricing, and sustainable 
energy system. Said expanded approach is an 
effective device in overcoming challenges in the 
institution of international energy relations. 
Along with windows of investment opportunity, 
an aggressive energy market becomes apparent. 
In consonance with the country’s aim to ensure 
energy security, local and foreign investors are 
being invited to participate in the PECR for the 
exploration, development and production of 
energy resources such as petroleum, geothermal 
and coal. This is further amplified by offering
possible investments in the construction of 
strategic natural gas infrastructure projects, like 
LNG import facilities and pipeline transmission 
systems.
The Philippines is assuming an active role in 
the energy cooperation programs of various 
international organizations such as the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), 
and the APEC. Moreover, the country has 
been undertaking dialogues, and bilateral and 
multilateral agreements with other countries, 
where energy cooperation is an indispensable 
ingredient.
Bilateral Cooperation
Bilateral agreements with other countries, 
institutions and agencies are being entered 
into by the Philippines through MOA and 
MOU, Memorandum of Intent, Memorandum 
of Cooperation, among others. Following are 
notable bilateral agreements of the Philippines 
with other countries: 
• The 5th Meeting of the Philippines-Indonesia 
Joint Commission for Bilateral Cooperation 
(JCBC) was held on 14 December 2011, 
in Manila. The JCBC is a consultative and 
monitoring mechanism that facilitates 
discussion and implementation of cooperative 
undertakings between countries. In the 
area of energy cooperation, the Commission 
agreed to review the 2001 MOU on coal, gas 
and geothermal energy development. 
• The MOU with Brazil – the first bilateral
cooperation on energy – on Bioenergy 
Cooperation aims to facilitate the 
development of biofuels particularly 
bioethanol. The MOU, which was signed 
on 24 June 2009, is seen to support the 
Biofuels Act of 2006. Brazil is one of the 
largest producer and exporter of ethanol in 
the world contributing about 90.0 percent 
of the global market supply. The other MOU 
with Brazil, signed on 23 August 2011, is a 
technical cooperation to promote initiatives 
in priority areas of both countries.
• The MOA with India on Enhanced Cooperation 
in the Field of Renewable Energy was signed 
in October 2007 prior to the ratification of
the RE Act of the Philippines. Said agreement 
complements the landmark legislation on 
renewable energy which provides for the 
aggressive development and utilization of 
renewable energy resources.
The agreement is to be in force for a period 
of three (3) years and may be extended for another two (2) years by mutual consent of 
both countries. The Philippines has recently 
agreed to the extension of the MOA. 
• The MOU with Korean Consortium – SK 
Engineering & Construction Co, Ltd., Korea 
Western Power Co, Ltd. and Archinet 
International Inc., a Filipino company – was 
signed in February 2008 for the development 
of the natural gas industry. The MOU was 
extended for another year from its original 
scheduled termination. 
The scope of the cooperation would include 
the Province of Bataan as the primary 
beneficiary. However, it is expected to also
benefit neighboring municipalities of Clark
and Subic, as well as the Metro Manila areas. 
Based on the progress report (technical 
study) of the Korean Consortium, the PNOCAlternative Fuels Corporation (PAFC) site 
in Limay, Bataan was found suitable for the 
480-MW natural-fired power plant but not
for LNG terminal (underground storage 
cavern). 
• The cooperation agreement with Kuwait 
was signed on 15 August 2008 to establish
a general framework for cooperation to 
promote and encourage joint activities in 
the fields of oil and gas in accordance with
existing laws of both countries. It establishes 
bilateral/multilateral cooperation, initiate 
studies, pooling of resources by both 
governments and/or private sector for joint 
projects and initiate individual/collective 
actions to assess and review issues on oil 
and gas. 
• The Philippines and Thailand had signed 
several agreements pertaining to the 
development of oil and gas sector. Among 
these was the MOU between the DOE and 
Thailand’s Ministry of Energy on Cooperation 
in October 2003 with the objective of 
undertaking joint studies, investigate and 
assess possibilities of cooperation on oil and 
gas exploration, development, production, 
storage, distribution and utilization of related 
facilities, and promotion and development 
of potential synergy. Consequently, another 
MOU was signed between PNOC and Public 
Company Limited (PTT) in February 2004 
to establish a Technical Working Group 
(TWG) under the supervision of the Joint 
Cooperation Committee (JCC) created 
pursuant to the aforementioned MOU with 
Thailand.
Likewise, the MOU on Joint Cooperation on 
Gas Value Chain Business between PNOC 
and PTT was signed on 5 October 2007. The
MOU is a joint cooperation on oil and gas 
exploration and promotion of development 
and investments in certain areas mutually 
agreed by parties. The Work Program 
identified joint studies for BatMan 1 Project
(Transmission Pipeline), BatMan 2 Project 
(Transmission Pipeline, LNG Receiving 
Terminal, Power Plants), BatCave Project 
(Sub-sea Pipeline) and other natural gas 
value chain business including, but not 
limited to, transmission & distribution 
pipeline network, gas processing, storage, 
LNG receiving terminals, supply and trading, 
transportation, and sale of LNG to the 
Philippines.
It is notable that since 2003, PTT of 
Thailand has been actively involved in 
the Philippine downstream oil industry. 
PTT has established presence by putting 
several gasoline stations since the country 
went on full deregulation. And in terms of 
petroleum products storage facilities, PTT 
has constructed and owns a bulk storage 
facility in Lapu-lapu City, Cebu which was 
inaugurated in 2006. In addition, on lease by 
the Philippine Coastal Storage and Pipeline 
Corp. (PCSPC) to PTT are storage facilities 
in Subic Bay Free Port Zone, Zambales and 
Clark, Angeles City, Pampanga.
The DOE and the United States Geological 
Services (USGS) signed an MOU in March 2007 on 
Scientific and Technical Cooperation in the Earth
Sciences. Under the MOU, the DOE implemented 
a project title “Coalbed Methane (CBM) Resource 
of Selected Coalfields: A New Alternative Clean 
Burning Fossil Fuel” from 2007-2010. The 
project studied coalbed methane resource 
potential in several coalfields in the country,
which may be tapped as fuel. Experts/scientists 
from USGS were dispatched to the country to 
provide lecture on coalbed assessment and 
utilization, while DOE personnel were sent to 
the U.S. for training on the same subject. 
Regional Cooperation
The Philippines actively participates in regional 
energy cooperation, and notable among which 
are the ASEAN, APEC, and the Asia-Europe 
Meeting.
Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN)
Since the group’s creation in 1967, Member 
Countries of the ASEAN have undertaken energy 
cooperation activities. Presently, regional 
projects that were implemented and continued 
to be carried out are under the framework of the 
APAEC 2010-2015. The sub-sector networks
under the APAEC are focused on the following 
areas: energy infrastructure integration 
through the regional power grid and gas pipeline 
interconnectivity; regional energy policy and 
planning; energy efficiency and conservation;
collaboration on coal development and use; 
renewable energy development; and, civilian 
nuclear energy cooperation. The ASEAN regional 
cooperation on energy has expanded in recent 
years to include the ASEAN + 3 (Japan, Korea 
and China) and ASEAN + 6 (Japan, Korea, China, 
Australia, New Zealand and India). 
The 29th ASEAN Ministers on Energy Meeting 
(AMEM), including the 8th AMEM+3 and 5th
East Asia Summit (EAS) were held in Jerudong, 
Brunei Darussalam on 20 September 2011. The 
theme of the 29th AMEM focused on “ASEAN 
Connectivity,” which echoed the directions and 
targets embodied in the Master Plan on ASEAN 
Connectivity and the aspiration of an ASEAN 
Community by 201593. During the conduct 
of the 8th AMEM+3, the Ministers agreed that 
enhancing intra-ASEAN connectivity will bring 
the region closer to its goal of achieving greater 
energy security94.
Meanwhile, the Ministers during the 5th EAS 
Energy Ministers Meeting (EMM) encouraged 
the continued updating and information sharing 
on the use of energy-saving technologies and 
reaffirmed the importance of establishing
efficient, transparent, reliable, competitive and
flexible energy markets as a means to provide
affordable, secure and clean energy supplies for 
the region95.
Projects and Agreements
Several projects and agreements are being 
implemented under the ASEAN such as the 
finalization of the guidelines to speed up
the implementation of the ASEAN Power 
Grid (APG), the Trans-ASEAN Gas Pipeline 
(TAGP) Infrastructure Project, including the 
infrastructure for LNG trading, the ratification
of the ASEAN Petroleum Security Agreement 
(APSA), and the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement 
(AFTA).
Guidelines to speed up the implementation of the 
ASEAN Power Grid have been recommended and 
areawaitingfinalization. This specificallyapplies
to the reliability of operation, safety standards 
and procedures in generation and transmission, 
and investments for interconnection projects. 
Another initiative being undertaken through 
the ASEAN Council on Petroleum (ASCOPE) is 
the Trans-ASEAN Gas Pipeline which has been

Meanwhile, the new APSA was signed by the 
ASEAN Foreign Ministers on 01 March 2009 
during the 14th ASEAN SUMMIT in Cha-am, 
Huahin, Thailand. To date, the ASEAN member
states that have ratified the APSA include Brunei
Darussalam, Myanmar, Malaysia, Philippines, 
Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam. Cambodia, 
Indonesia and Lao PDR are in the final stages
of domestic consultations in ratifying the APSA. 
It was during the 17th AMEM held in July 1999 
in Bangkok, Thailand when the Philippines 
suggested a review of the 1986 APSA to make 
it more responsive to rising oil prices. It was 
recommended that provisions be explored 
to include pricing and operationalizing the 
agreement to benefit member states. Upon
instruction of the AMEM, the National
Committee of ASCOPE agreed to conduct a 
comprehensive review of the APSA during its 
53rd Meeting in Kuala Lumpur in April 2001. 
The new APSA aims “to enhance petroleum 
security, either individually or collectively, and 
minimize exposure to an emergency situation, 
through the implementation of short-, mediumand long-term measures.” It establishes a 
petroleum-sharing scheme for crude oil and/
or petroleum products to assist member states 
which are experiencing a shortfall of at least 10.0 
percent of the normal domestic requirement for 
a continuous period of at least 30 days.
Emergency response under its short-term 
measures includes demand restraint, fuel 
switching, surge protection and information 
sharing/e-trading. Likewise included is the 
Coordinated Emergency Response Mechanism 
(CERM), which may be implemented to 
immediately assist a member state in distress. 
CERM is a framework by which coordinated 
regional consultations will implement the 
APSA and rationalize plans and programs to 
enhance security of petroleum supply in times 
of supply shortages in the ASEAN region. The 
CERM provides for the trigger mechanism, 
explaining the procedures and operations for 
the activation/deactivation of assistance to a 
distressed member state. On the other hand, 
medium- and long-term measures include 
participation of member states in joint venture 
exploration, energy diversification, energy
efficiency, research and development, oil and
gas market liberalization, and oil stockpiling, 
among others.
On the other hand, the ASEAN integration in the 
trade of goods has been governed by a number 
of separate regional legal instruments. The goal 
of a single market and production base with free 
flow of goods by 2015 has been envisaged in the
ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) Blueprint. 
The AEC requires ASEAN to adopt a holistic 
approach by integrating various existing trade in 
goods related initiatives. This led to the signing 
of a more comprehensive agreement, the ASEAN 
Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA), by the 
Economic Ministers. The ATIGA consolidates 
and streamlines all the provisions in ensuring 
the realization of free flow of goods to provide
them with legal standing. It also provides the 
full tariff reduction schedule of each Member 
State and spells out the tariff rates to be applied 
for each year on each product up to 2015.
Under the ASEAN + 3 Energy Cooperation, 
initiatives are focused on energy security, oil 
stockpiling, Clean Development Mechanism 
(CDM) projects, and capacity building on nuclear 
energy safety. 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
(APEC)
The APEC primarily operates under three (3) 
pillars of activities: Trade and Investment 
Liberalization; Business Facilitation; and, 
Economic and Technical Cooperation.
APEC is the premier forum for trade and 
investment liberalization in the Asia-Pacific 
region and has set target dates for “free and 
open trade,” not later than the year 2010 
for industrialized economies, and 2020 for 
developing economies, as set in the Bogor 
Declaration. To date, there are about 30 
bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs) that have 
been concluded between Member Economies. 
Likewise, APEC is also pursuing trade and 
investment liberalization through its Regional 
Economic Integration agenda. 
On the other hand, APEC initiatives under 
the Business Facilitation activity include the 
following: 1) providing business with a concise 
one-stop repository of customs and trade 
facilitation-related information for all APEC 
Member Economies; 2) the APEC Tariff Database 
- provides users with easy access to its Member 
Economies’ tariff schedules, concessions, 
prohibitions and other information; and, 3) 
removal of behind-the-border barriers to trade 
through its Structural Reform agenda which 
focuses on reforming domestic policies and 
institutions that adversely affect the operation 
of markets and the capacity of businesses to 
access and to operate efficiently, among others.
Meanwhile, the Economic and Technical 
Cooperation pillar aims to build the capacity 
member economies to be fully participative 
in the regional economic and liberalization 
process. The energy sector falls under this 
pillar.
The Energy Working Group (EWG) launched 
in 1990 aims to maximize the energy sector’s 
contribution to the region’s economic and social 
well-being, while mitigating the environmental 
effects of energy supply and use. 
The EWG is assisted by four (4) Expert Groups, 
namely: the Clean Fossil Energy; Energy 
Efficiency and Conservation; Energy Data 
and Analysis, New and Renewable Energy 
Technologies) and two Task Forces: one on 
Biofuels and the other on Energy Trade and 
Investment (ETITF).
During the 9th meeting of the APEC Energy 
Ministers held in Fukui, Japan on 19 June 
2010, the “Fukui Declaration on Low Carbon 
Paths to Energy Security: Cooperative Energy 
Solutions for a Sustainable APEC” emphasized 
the challenges such as emerging concerns on 
global environment and the economy, efficient 
use of energy and cleaner energy supply that 
APEC economies have to face to ensure regional 
energy security. 
Meanwhile, the APEC Energy Policy Roundtable 
and the Joint Transportation and Energy 
Ministerial Conference were held in California, 
USA on 12 to 13 September 2011. The Policy 
Roundtable with the theme “Stability, Diversity 
and Resilience: Ensuring Energy for Growth” 
discussed the current pressing concerns on 
energy security in the region. In the areas of 
collaboration needed within the APEC region, 
the Philippines called on member economies 
to forge energy supply agreements citing as 
examples the existing coal supply agreement 
between the Philippines and Indonesia, widen 
utilization of environment-friendly natural 
gas by all sectors of the economy, as well as 
development of cleaner fuels such as renewable 
energy, biofuels and other alternative sources 
of energy through a more liberalized and 
economical flow of technology, among member 
economies. 
On the impact of technology in meeting the 
energy security challenge, the Philippines called 
for innovation in energy efficient technologies, 
development of energy service companies or 
ESCO’s and scaling up development of various 
renewable energy sources. One potential 
resource expected to improve security of energy 
supply is ocean energy. Thus, cooperation on 
R&D on ocean energy should be pursued to 
make use of this vast potential resource.Meanwhile, the First APEC Transportation and 
Energy Ministerial Conference is a public-private 
dialogue. A major output of the Conference was 
the adoption of the Action Agenda to move 
APEC towards “An Energy Efficient, Sustainable, 
and Low-Carbon Transport Future.” Among 
others, the Action Agenda directed both the 
Transportation Working Group and the EWG 
towards:
1. Strengthening transportation’s role in a 
clean-energy future;
2.	 Developing energy efficient transport
systems for livable low-carbon 
communities;
3. Powering low-carbon transport; and,
4. Greening the supply chain: Energy 
efficient freight transportation.
Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM)
The ASEM was established in 1996 working 
under the three (3) pillars of: 1) political 
dialogue; 2) security and the economy; and, 3) 
education and culture.
On 11 November 2011, the conference on 
“Harmonization of Biofuels Standards and
Application to Vehicle Technologies” conference 
was held in Manila provided a platform for 
Member Countries to promote their respective 
biofuels program with the end view of identifying 
the “best practices” for greater biofuel 
integration in the transport sector in ways that 
consider food security, job creation, energy 
security and environment sustainability96.
International Renewable 
Energy Agency (IRENA)
IRENA was officially instituted on 26 January
2009 in Bonn, Germany (Founding Conference) 
as a central platform of the various international 
96 Manila-ASEM Conference Statement, 11 November 2011, 
ManilaPhilippines
renewable communities that seeks to develop 
synergy, facilitate dialogue, best practices, 
knowledge and information sharing, capacity 
enhancement, and encourage investment.
IRENA activities include provision of useful 
advice and support to both developed and 
developing countries in accelerating the 
application of renewable energy and meet the 
anticipated growing demand in global energy 
by combining the use of renewable energy 
with energy efficiency. It facilitates access
to all relevant information, including reliable 
data on the potential of renewable energy, 
best practices, effective financial mechanisms
and state-of-the-art technological expertise. It 
likewise gathers world experts in workshops it 
organizes, assesses the readiness of the member 
countries to adopt renewable energy, prepares 
analysis and makes policy recommendations 
to governments for the wider deployment of 
renewable energy.
IRENA membership is open to States that are 
members of the United Nations and regional 
intergovernmental economic integration 
organizations that are constituted by sovereign 
States, at least one of which is a Member of 
the Agency, and to which its Member States 
have transferred competence in at least one of 
the matters within the purview of the Agency 
(referred to as “regional organizations”). The 
intense desire of the government to widespread 
and increased adoption of renewable energy, 
the Philippines has signified its membership
with signing of the Statue of the IRENA during 
the Founding Conference in 2009. The same 
was ratified and confirmed by President Aquino
on 19 May 2011. 
As a Member State, the Philippines has the right 
to one vote in the Assembly on matters requiring 
consensus. Among the privileges accorded to a 
Member State include: 
• access to renewable energy related 
information and knowledge such as 
on policies and incentives, available 
technologies and best practices;
• opportunities for technology deployment 
and transfer from selected Member States 
that would hasten the development of local 
capacity and competence; 
• opportunities to participate in education, 
training, joint research and other capacitybuilding;
• participation in a wide network that would 
open up and expand opportunities for 
investment by other Member States in 
renewable energy in the country; and,
• access to policy advice and assistance, 
financing mechanism, economics and energy
efficiency measures.
International Energy Forum 
(IEF)
The IEF is a biennial meeting/dialogue 
of Ministers from more than 60 energy 
producing and consuming countries (from both 
industrialized and developing countries). The 
IEF Ministers also interact with CEOs of leading 
energy companies in the International Energy 
Business Forum. Such meeting/dialogue, 
which started in 1991, aims to address issues 
on energy supply security, as well as the links 
between energy, environment and the economy. 
On 22 February 2011, the DOE signed the 
IEF Charter during Extraordinary Ministerial 
Meeting held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
Asia Cooperation Dialogue 
(ACD)
The ACD is a grouping of Asian countries which 
seeks to promote interdependence among Asian 
countries in all areas of cooperation, expand 
trade and financial market within Asia and
transform the Asian continent into an Asian 
community. With the admission of the Islamic 
Republic of Afghanistan, ACD’s membership has 
now increased to 32.
Among the areas of cooperation espoused 
by ACD include: energy, poverty alleviation, 
agriculture, transport linkages, biotechnology, 
E-commerce, infrastructure fund, E- education, 
SMEs cooperation, IT development, science and 
technology, tourism, financial cooperation, and
human resource development. 
The Philippines is one of the co-prime movers 
on energy together with Indonesia, Lao PDR, 
Kazhakstan, China, Bahrain and Qatar. The 
ACD Action Plan was drafted by the Philippines 
and Indonesia, which is being proposed to be 
revisited on its responsiveness to the ACD goal 
on energy security and the new directives issued 
during the First ACD Summit97. 
International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA)
The IAEA is an international agency with the 
primary purpose of accelerating and expanding 
the contribution of atomic energy to peace, 
health and prosperity in the world. The 
Philippines – being a member of the IAEA since 
1958 – benefited from the technical assistance
through various trainings on nuclear energy 
manpower development/human resource 
capacity enhancement. 
As nuclear energy is being explored as a longterm option for power generation, a technical 
assistance was granted to the Philippines 
through dispatch of IAEA experts/review 
mission in January 2008. The purpose of the 
study visit is to advice the government on 
the general infrastructure requirements for 
launching a nuclear power program and the 
feasibility of rehabilitating the Bataan Nuclear 
Power Plant (BNPP). 
97 The First ACD Summit was held on 16-17 October 2012 in Kuwait.
The ACD Action Plan was approved on 24 November 2013 in 
ManamaKingdom of BahrainUnited Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC)
As energy being one of the sectors involved on 
the issues about climate change, the DOE has 
been actively participating in climate change 
discussions, specifically conferences and
negotiations under the UNFCCC.
The UNFCCC was adopted in 1992 as an 
international political response to climate 
change, which sets out a framework for action 
aimed at stabilizing atmospheric concentrations 
of greenhouse gases to avoid “dangerous 
anthropogenic interference” with the climate 
system. Meanwhile, the Kyoto Protocol adopted 
by the UNFCCC in 1997 commits industrialized 
countries and countries in transition to a 
market economy to achieve GHG emission
reduction targets by an average of 5.2 percent
below 1990 levels between 2008-2012 (the first
commitment period). 
The UNFCCC Bali Conference in 2007 established 
the Ad-Hoc Working Group on Long-Term
Cooperative Action (AWG-LCA) with a mandate 
to focus on key elements of cooperation, such 
as mitigation, adaptation, finance, as well
as technology and capacity building. This 
includes GHG emission reduction commitments
after 2012 (Post-Kyoto) whereby developing 
countries also have to set emission reduction 
targets. With this, the energy sector is seen to 
play a vital role on crafting the climate change 
mitigation pathway for the country. 
The DOE is actively working with the 
Climate Change Commission (CCC) and other 
stakeholders in the formulation of NCCAP, 
which includes sustainable energy strategies 
focusing on energy efficiency and conservation,
renewable energy, and environmentally 
sustainable transport systems.
The implementation of energy projects 
identified until 2030 entail a total
investment cost of PhP 2.80 trillion. 
Most of the renewable energy projects 
identified are currently in predevelopment stage and the estimated 
investments are based on costs of 
various activities involved in the initial 
stage of the project development. 
Table 84 shows that among the energy 
sub-sectors, downstream natural gas 
infrastructure facilities will require 
the largest investment cost of PhP 
1.21 trillion. The power sector will 
require PhP 659.70 billion followed by
renewable energy at PhP 612.10 billion, 
alternative fuels for transportation at 
PhP 244.68 billion, petroleum at PhP 
43.56 billion and coal at PhP 25.44
billion.
OIL AND GAS
The progressive development in the 
conduct of the PECR has continuously 
encouraged investments in the 
Philippine upstream petroleum sector. 
For the 4th PECR, 15 areas were offered which
resulted in the submission of 20 bid proposals 
from petroleum companies. 
 The DOE monitors 27 SCs currently existing 
nationwide and still continues to explore new 
resource discoveries to boost the upstream 
petroleum industry. In line with this, aggressive 
targets are drawn up for the planning period 
2012-2030 which provide opportunities for the 
entry of investors. The sector’s plan includes 
the acquisition of 32,500 line kilometers of 2D
seismic data and 3,200 square kilometers of 
3D seismic data. This would require PhP 2.73 
billion and PhP 3.33 billion, respectively, with 
a total cost of PhP 6.05 billion. Further, 76
offshore and 19 onshore wells are expected to 
be drilled that would require a total investment 
of PhP 37.51billion. In addition, 66 SCs are
targeted to be awarded over the planning period. 
To sum up, the oil and gas sector requires a total 
investment of PhP 43.56 billion as shown in
Table 85.

To boost local coal production, the sector is 
continuously looking on prospective areas for 
exploration, development and production. It is 
targeted that at the end of planning horizon, coal 
upstream projects would require a total of PhP 25.44
billion as indicated in Table 86. In PECR 4 conducted 
for coal, 38 areas were offered to the private sector. 
RENEWABLE ENERGY
The National Renewable Energy Program 
(NREP) has set aggressive targets for capacities 
to be generated utilizing various renewable 
energy (RE) resources in the country. As 
indicated in Table 87, PhP 612.10 billion will 
be needed for the development of RE resources 
to provide an additional estimated capacity of 
8,240 MW over the entire planning period. The 
preparatory activities for the development of 
hydro projects comprise 98% of the total RE 
investment cost at PhP 598.87 billion. Further,
PhP 8.70 billion will be required for biomass 
projects, PhP 2.35 billion for geothermal
projects, PhP 1.56 billion for wind projects,
PhP 493.50 million for ocean energy projects
and PhP 134.69 million for solar projects.
Hydro
The pre-development of 304 sites of hydro 
projects would be able to produce 4,753
MW at the cost of PhP 598.87 billion. Table
88 shows that Luzon has 188 potential 
sites with a prospective capacity of 3,090 
MW and will require PhP 389.30 billion to 
implement preparatory activities. Most 
of these sites are located in the Cordillera 
Region. Likewise, the Visayas area could 
generate 251 MW from 46 sites and would
require PhP 31.59 billion. On the other
hand, the Mindanao Region has 70 areas 
identified with a potential generation of
1,412 MW that would need PhP 177.98 
billion for development.

Solar
Twenty (20) areas in the country are identified
for pre-development activities of solar energy 
resources. Table 93 details these sites that could 
generate a total of 284 MW with investment 
cost of PhP 134.69 million. Sixteen sites (16) 
with a potential capacity of 230 MW will be 
studied in Luzon which would need PhP 116.92 
million. Two (2) sites with 32 MW are identified
in Visayas with an estimated cost of PhP 2.98 
million. Similarly, two (2) sites with 22 MW 
will also be validated in Mindanao which would 
require PhP14.79 million.
NATURAL GAS
The Batangas to Manila (Batman1) project 
in Luzon will be implemented in 2017. The 
Floating Storage Regasification Unit (FSRU)
that will be installed in Mindanao in 2016 would 
have an estimated cost of PhP 42.7 billion. In 
addition, the Pagbilao LNG terminal hub facility 
in Pagbilao, Quezon will be implemented by 
Energy World Corporation in 2014.
There are other potential pipeline projects 
and LNG terminals identified in Luzon and
infrastructure facilities to be pursued in 
Mindanao as detailed in Table 94. The projects 
identified in Luzon would require a total of PhP
48.02 billion while the projects in Mindanao 
will require PhP1.12 trillion. The Mindanao 
projects will consist of pipeline distribution 
systems to the PHIVEDEC Ecozone, Cagayan de
Oro City, Iligan City, General Santos and Davao 
City. 
ALTERNATIVE FUELS
The DOE continuously exerts its effort to 
develop cleaner and environment- friendly 
alternative fuels for the transport sector such as 
CNG (for buses and taxis), biodiesel, bioethanol, 
autoLPG and electric vehicles. The development 
of biofuels and its infrastructure would require 
a total of PhP 244.68 billion.
Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Vehicles
CNG Buses
In 2004, the DOE implemented the Natural Gas 
Vehicle Program for Public Transport (NGVPPT) 
which provided an attractive incentive package 
to entice the private sector to participate in the 
program. The program envisioned that a total 
of 15,000 units CNG-fed buses will be available
nationwide in 2030. To date, there are 61 
Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) buses with 41 
buses plying over the Batangas-Laguna-Manila 
routes. It is targeted that a total of 14,939 buses 
will be needed nationwide that would require 
PhP 74.70 billion. It is projected that Luzon 
will need 70.0 percent of the buses which is 
equivalent to 10,439 units, Visayas with 2,400 
units and Mindanao with 2,100 units. The 
details are shown in Table 96.

CNG Refilling Stations
With the projected increase in the demand for 
CNG supply for both buses and taxis, there is 
a corresponding need for the installation of 
refueling or refilling stations. It is forecasted
that about 149 refilling stations will be needed
during the planning period which would require 
PhP 14.90 billion.
Biofuels
The mandated increase in the percent blend of 
biofuels (biodiesel and bioethanol) will be 
implemented until 2030. This is projected to 
require a total investment cost of PhP 77.85
billion.
Biodiesel
Biodiesel blend will increase to 5.0 percent in
2015, 10.0 percent in 2020 and 20.0 percent by
2025. With this requirement, a total of PhP 9.0
billion will be needed to install the corresponding 
plants to provide the biodiesel demand.

bioethanol blend will increase to 20.0 
percent and that would require a total 
of 13,390 million liters by 2030. Around 
27 bioethanol plants are needed that 
would entail a total investment cost of 
PhP 68.85 billion.
Auto-LPG
The utilization of LPG as an alternative 
fuel for taxis is expected to continuously 
increase annually until 2026. With this 
trend, the conversion of taxis into autoLPG vehicles is projected to cost PhP 
2.90 billion. In order to sustain the 
supply of auto-LPG until 2026, 65 LPG
stations are required nationwide which 
would require a total investment cost of 
PhP 461.50 million.
E-Vehicle
The use of E-trike is another alternative 
transport mode being promoted by the 
Government. Currently, there are 630 electric 
vehicles that exist in the country. With 
the market transformation initiative to be 
introduced, 100,000 E-trikes are initially 
targeted for deployment nationwide through 
ADB’s a lease-to own scheme. This will be pilottested to prove their commercial viability. In 
addition to this, a total of 129,370 E-trikes are 
projected to be available during the planning 
period which would require an investment of 
PhP25.874 billion.
POWER
For the planning period 2012 to 2030, a 
total of 7,779 MW capacity is estimated to be 
generated from the indicative power projects 
listed in Table 103 requiring a total investment 
cost of PhP 659.7 billion. In Luzon, a total of
PhP 430.74 billion will be needed to generate 
6,819.3 MW of additional capacity. On 
the other hand, Visayas is expected to 
provide an additional 433 MW capacity 
with a total estimated investment cost of 
PhP 186.28 billion. Moreover, indicative 
power projects in Mindanao show a total 
estimated investment cost of PhP 42.68 
billion will be needed for the additional 
527 MW capacity.
