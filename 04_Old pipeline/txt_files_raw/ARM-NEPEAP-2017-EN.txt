World Bank / Global Environmental Facility
Government of Armenia• 2/3 of all energy resources imported
• Emerging supply gap: 
• Demand grew and forecasted to grow further, 
existing supply capacities insufficient to meet the 
growing demand
• Future demand supplied by aging capacities to 
require 2-3 times more TPES
• Energy price hike in the last decade 
poses affordability and competitiveness 
problems
• Electricity price rose by 94-112%
• Natural gas price rose by 200-250%
• Armenia’s economic indicators dragging:
• Global competitiveness index dropped from 117

• NEEAPs in Southeast European Countries (West Balkans, Moldova, Ukraine, 
pending Georgia) 
• focus on documenting ongoing efforts, 
• identify cost-effective and/or low-cost/no-cost measures to promote energy efficiency, 
• under conditions of limited availability of funds from state budget, rely on IFI lending 
and private sector participation
• 1
st National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP)
• developed in 2010 for 2010-2013, assessed for 2010-2014
• Set energy saving target for 3% by 2013;

13• Due to the mixed reporting on lending, impossible to separate sectoral impacts
EE credit lines for various borrower groups operating through banks on commercial terms – successful! 
The lending for public building energy efficiency very successful!
Efficiency upgrades in transport sector successful both in public and private sectors
• Not only through efficiency, but also through sacrificed comfort, hence utility affordability is an issue
Energy Tariff increase has had a direct impact on curtailing consumption
Despite crisis, slow economic growth, lending and EE investments grewLegislation, programming, strategic documents, planning, technical regulations

Introduction of benchmarking through best available technologies also requires strong legal provisions coupled with incentives
Not all sectors 
adequately covered by

Not all EE credit lines have financing terms adequate for energy efficiency borrowers
Some sectors have multiple credit lines serving (e.g. public buildings, households, corporate), multi-apartment building niche not covered by any
Lack of capacities LFIs lack skills and knowledge to adequately partner with private sector for EE investment financing
ESCOs lack skills for bankable project preparation and negotiations with LFIs
Industrial enterprises lack knowledge and understanding of EE and its true costs & benefits 
Multi-apartment buildings’ capacities to serve as a lending partner for EE investments
Municipalities lack capacities in energy planning and project development
Central Government lack capacities in monitoring and reporting on EE Plans
Imperfect information and 
Lack of information dissemination about the opportunities and benefits of EE, RE, technical and financing solutions, service & material vendors• Adoption/ enforcement of bylaws on energy auditing and EE in public procurement
• Development/ enforcement of EE standards, codes and labeling for all uses
Continued reform:
• Continued operation and expansion of R2E2 Fund operations
• Smooth integration of E5P grant co-financing for non-bankable projects
• Leveraging IFIs & LFIs resources to address underserved segments of EE financing market
EE funding:
• Create favorable investment environment in multi-apartment buildings
• Introduce private sector participation through private maintenance companies & ESCOs
New/improved housing 
legislation:
• Revise tariffs to incentivize energy efficiency
• Low-income assistance for implementation of energy efficiency measures Tariff reform:
• Incentives for wider combined energy efficiency-integrated renewable energy application

I.1
USAID LEDS Program supported development of national energy balance according to IEA and Eurostat requirements 
for years 2010-2012. The National Statistical Service, Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources and INOGATE Technical 
Secretariat have signed a memorandum on "Cooperation in the field of statistics" including an action plan related to 
actions necessary the energy balance. However, no regular procedure for routine preparation of energy balances for 
following years was put in place.

I.3
Over $86 million has been committed to EE and EE-integrated renewable energy investment during 2010-2014 via 
various donors and IFIs, such as WB, IFC, GEF, EBRD, IFC, GGF, EIB, KfW, and UNDP. In addition, these donor and IFI 
funds have had a market transformation impact on the financial services sector. According to Econoler experts' 
estimations, the local financial institutions and universal credit organizations have also tapped into this market and 
financed EE & RE investments from own resources in addition to on-lending portfolio with the IFIs. By expert 
assessment, over $420 million has been invested by LFIs and UCOs in diverse loans, with average equity financing of 
17.5% which leverages approximately $89 million in equity participation. Overall, it can be concluded that 
approximately $595 million has been invested in EE and EE-integrated RE solutions during 2010-2014.

About 150 thousand TOE was saved in 2010-2015 
through EE lending, and more than 18.30 mln TOE would 
be saved in 2016-2020, due to the cumulative effect of 
savings from past investments. GGF is going to be e main 
player in this activity with its estimated share in total 
savings expected to be about 97.2%. This may potentially 
be due to the fact, that majority of IFIs has failed to 
provide reasonable forecast of lending plans beyond LFIs and IFIs IN 2010 - 2015, USD

renovated) under the state funding".
II.3.c Changes to the Gov.Decision on Energy Audits
II.3.d - The energy efficiency and energy saving related tasks and functions were added in the MUD charter in 2013 by the Government decision N225-N (13 March 
2013). According to the 2014 Action Plan, the MUD is currently elaborating a draft government decision “On application of measures directed towards increasing 
of energy saving and energy efficiency in objects constructed (reconstructed, renovated) by the state means”. Workplan for 2015 includes new Housing Code 
development.

Monetarizing the NEEAP Costs & Benefits (Million US$)Tasks associated with 2nd NEEAP Oversight
• Develop and maintain appropriate and transparent data bases on energy 
efficiency and renewable energy sources (monitoring and reporting 
services).
• Monitoring, verification of savings and preparing reports on realized 
energy audits in building sector.
• Organize and monitor training courses for energy auditors.
• Cooperate with non-governmental sector in developing the awareness of 
the need of EE and RES.
• Encourage innovative approaches for investment including third party 
financing or co-financing.
• Undertake measures for raising the awareness of consumers on end-use 
heat efficiency and increasing the efficiency of MABs, insulation, efficiency 
of pumpsflow regulation and other distribution efficiencies can occurThank you
