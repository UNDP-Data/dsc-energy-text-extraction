REmap 2030 analysis
November 2014REmap 2030 – the global roadmap prepared by the International Renewable Energy 
Agency (IRENA) – assesses how countries can work together to double the share of 
renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030. It represents an unprecedented 
international effort that brings together the work of more than 90 national experts 
in nearly 60 countries, who continue to collaborate through global web discussions, 
regional meetings and national workshops involving technology experts, industry 
bodies and policy makers. Following the global REmap report released in January 
2014, IRENA is producing a series of country-specific reports built on the same 
detailed analyses.
As the largest energy consumer in the world, China must play a pivotal role in the global transition to a sustainable 
energy future in an increasingly ‘carbon-constrained’ world. The country is already a global leader in renewable energy, 
with massive potential to harness a diverse range of renewable sources and technologies, both for power generation 
and for end-use sectors.
Compared to energy systems based on fossil fuel, renewable energy offers broader participation, enhances energy 
security, creates more jobs and provides an effective route to reducing atmospheric pollution and carbon dioxide (CO2) 
emissions – a goal that becomes increasingly urgent by the day. Renewable energy technologies now provide the most 
cost-effective option for delivery of energy services in a growing range of locations and conditions, while innovation 
and increasing deployment continue to drive costs down even more.
Under current policies and investment patterns, the share of renewables in China’s energy mix is projected to only 
reach 17% by 2030 compared to 13% in 2010. REmap analysis, however, shows that the country could realistically 
achieve scaling up modern renewables to 26%. The required investment of USD 145 billion could potentially save China 
more than USD 200 billion, factoring in the benefits of improved health and lower CO2 emissions.
While countries must make energy decisions based on their own circumstances, each decision needs to be based upon 
the most comprehensive and transparent data available. China has demonstrated that it possesses the technical and 
human resources, as well as the dynamism, to spearhead a transformation of global energy use. REmap 2030 suggests 
concrete pathways to be considered to meet this generational challenge: to attain a clean and secure energy system 
in China and for the world.

China
China’s energy policy matters globally. The country is the 
world’s largest energy user, accounting for one fifth of 
all global energy consumption. By 2030, China’s energy 
consumption is expected to increase by 60%. China’s 
energy choices will be a major influence on the world’s 
ability to curb climate change.
There are rising concerns over energy security. As 
of 2014, about 30% of China’s natural gas supply is 
imported, but this could increase substantially. China 
imports more than half of its crude oil supply, and this 
will also increase. Shale gas was considered as an alternative, but local exploration proved challenging. Until 
recently, China has been meeting most of its energy 
demand with coal. However, growing concerns over 
the environmental impacts of coal (severe air pollution 
that caused 1.2 million premature deaths in 2010, high 
water consumption compounding water scarcity) have 
prompted a shift in policy.
As a result, China is turning to renewable energy. It 
already has the world’s largest installed capacity of wind 
and hydroelectric power, as well as the vast majority of 
solar heating and biogas installations. In 2013 China 
installed more solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity than the 
whole of Europe.
This strategy is bringing substantial economic returns. 
China has become a major exporter of renewable energy 
technology, accounting for two-thirds of global solar PV 
module production. Its renewable energy sector 
employed 2.6 million people in 2013. And it has the 
financial ability to invest further.
Under a business-as-usual scenario, China could fall far 
short of its full renewable energy potential. However, 
given the implementation of the right mix of policies, 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
HIGHLIGHTS
● China has become a global leader in renewable energy. It has vast resources and great potential for 
future development. In 2013, China installed more 
new renewable energy capacity than all of Europe 
and the rest of the Asia Pacific region.
● The main drivers for this shift are the increasing 
cost-competitiveness of renewable energy technologies and other benefits such as improved 
energy security and decreased air pollution.
● The share of renewables in China’s energy mix 
was 13% in 2010, including an estimated 6% traditional use of biomass, and 7% modern renewables. 
Hydroelectricity (3.4%) and solar thermal (1.5%) 
accounted for most of China’s modern renewable 
energy use.
● Under current policies and investment patterns, 
the share of modern renewables in China’s energy 
mix will rise to 16% by 2030. REmap 2030 estimates that it would be both technically and economically feasible to increase the share of modern 
renewables to 26%.
● Reaching a 26% share for modern renewable energy would require investments of USD 145 billion 
per year between 2014 and 2030. Accounting 
for improved health and reduced carbon dioxide 
(CO2) emissions, renewables would bring savings 
of between USD 55 and USD 228 billion per year 
to China’s economy.
● Under REmap 2030, the share of renewables in the 
power sector would increase from 20% to nearly 
40% by 2030. This assumes accelerated growth 
in wind and solar PV, and full deployment of 
hydroelectricity. To achieve this requires significant 
growth in grid and transmission capacity, and 
power market reform.
● Significant potential exists for renewable energy 
in end-use sectors. Industry can achieve a 10% 
renewable energy share, compared to almost none 
at present. The building sector can transform its 
fuel mix to two-thirds renewables. Solar thermal 
heat and electrification can help, as can modern 
biomass for process heating and space/water 
heating.the country has the resources and the dynamism to lead 
a transformation of the global energy system.
REmap 2030: China’s renewable 
potential
REmap 2030 shows how the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix can be doubled by 2030. 
China’s role is crucial for it to succeed.
Using projections from the Chinese Renewable Energy 
Centre (CNREC), IRENA calculates that the share of 
modern renewables (which excludes traditional uses 
of biomass) in China’s energy mix will rise from about 
7% in 2010 to 16% by 2030 under the business-as-usual 
scenario (the Reference Case in this study).
Under REmap 2030, however, with the right policies 
and support, the share of renewables in the energy mix 
could quadruple to 26% with technologies currently 
available. That would make China the world’s largest 
user of renewable energy, accounting for about 20% of 
global use. Hydroelectricity, wind power, solar PV, solar 
thermal and modern biomass would constitute most of 
the renewable energy mix of the country.
A strategy for a diverse mix of 
renewables in the power sector
China has massive potential to harness renewable energy for power. Currently, 20% of the country’s electricity 
comes from renewables. Under the business-as-usual 
scenario, this rises to 30% in 2030. With REmap 2030 
options, it approaches 40%. Hydroelectricity would be 
the largest type, as is the case today, but wind and solar 
PV would see the largest growth and would play an essential role.
Hydro: China’s hydroelectricity potential by 2030 is 
400 gigawatts-electric (GWe). Already envisaged in the 
business-as-usual scenario, this will require significant 
cross-boundary coordination, as well as enhanced river 
and water management. Total pumped hydro capacity, 
crucial for energy storage, should reach 100 GWe.
Wind: Wind became China’s second largest source of 
renewable power in 2013 and has potential to grow 
further. The best wind resources are found in the northwest and northeast. REmap 2030 envisages a fivefold 
increase in onshore wind capacity, from 91 GWe in 2013 
to 500 GWe by 2030 (twice the current installed capacity worldwide) and an additional 60 GWe capacity in 
offshore wind. For this to occur, the realisable resource 
potential by 2030 in northern China would need to be 
deployed, and the early retirement of some coal capacity would be necessary (mainly in western China). New 
grid and transmission capacity (including 100 new DC 
power lines) will be needed to link wind power with 
demand in southern and eastern China.
Solar PV: China installed 13 GWe of solar PV capacity 
in 2013, a substantial increase which resulted in a 
total installed capacity of 20 GWe. 1 GWe came from 
distributed projects, such as rooftop solar PV on 
residential or commercial buildings. China aims to raise 
the total to 70 GWe by 2017, with equal contributions 
from utility-scale and distributed projects. REmap 2030 
envisages a total installed capacity of 308 GW by 2030e
which is twice the current installed capacity worldwide. 
Nearly 40% of this would be distributed. 
Challenges and solutions:
— Costs and externalities: Wind and solar PV cannot 
compete with the low cost of coal power generation, 
based on today’s market prices. They do become 
cost-competitive, however, when accounting for 
coal’s significant externalities, such as air pollution 
and its impact on human health. China would need 
a nationwide price of about USD 50 per tonne of 
carbon dioxide (CO2) to raise the cost of coal power 
generation sufficiently to make distributed solar PV 
cost-competitive. Prices closer to USD 25-30 per 
tonne CO2 would ensure that wind and solar PV 
could compete with coal at utility scale.
— Grids and transmission: Power generation from 
both utility scale solar PV and wind in China 
has been curtailed by a lack of sufficient grid 
infrastructure, and because coal power plants are 
given priority dispatching. This is improving as 
preferential policies for renewables are introduced. 
Grid and transmission capacity issues will gain 
more importance in the future, as an important 
share of China’s wind and solar PV will need to be 
built far from population centres. Better regional 
coordination is needed to create power exchange 
and new interconnectors between provinces, and 
power trading with neighbouring countries (e.g.,
hydroelectricity from Siberia and Southeast Asia, or 
wind from Mongolia.)— Distributed solar PV offers another solution. For this to 
be successful, business models need to be developed 
that result in higher rates of return, uncertainties in 
ownership should be resolved, and capacity growth 
needs to be accelerated.
— Power market design and infrastructure planning:
The current electricity grid is not designed to handle 
high shares of variable renewable power. In order to 
accommodate this, accelerated power market reform will be needed, including establishing an electricity retail market segment, which would not only 
encourage competition on electricity retail prices, 
but also innovation in creating business models for 
applications of distributed generation renewable 
electricity. In parallel, China should expand the study 
on its future grid, particularly incorporating smart 
technologies to cope with large-scale variable renewables located in Northern and Western China, far 
away from the centers of the demand.
The role of biomass in the renewable 
energy transition
Under REmap 2030, modern biomass would account for 
a quarter of all China’s renewable energy use, primarily 
for end-uses such as fuel and heating. Reaching this potential poses significant challenges for data collection, 
substituting modern for traditional use of biomass, and 
transport logistics.
Challenges and solutions:
— Biomass feedstock: China has abundant biomass 
resources, but utilising them sustainably and affordably will require carefully crafted policies. The 
main forms of biomass are straw (concentrated in 
the northeast and the lower Yangtze River) and 
fuel-wood (in the southeast and northeast). There 
is also potential from forestry residues. Transport 
of biomass feedstock from areas that are scattered 
across the country to specific centres of demand is 
a major challenge.
— Cooking/heating/power generation: Nearly all 
biomass today is used in traditional forms, i.e. for 
cooking. The share of the population that relies on 
traditional use of biomass is decreasing, and the use 
of modern cooking stoves is increasing. But the numbers are uncertain, and data collection needs to improve to assess the challenge ahead. Power production from biomass and waste could account for 10% 
of the total renewable power generation by 2030.
— Industry: Biomass in Chinese industry is currently 
limited to pulp and paper making, and only in small 
amounts. By 2030, biomass and waste could account for up to one-fifth of the process energy 
needed to produce clinker, one of the production 
processes that account for the largest share of energy use in China’s manufacturing industry. Biomass 
could also be used in industrial combined heat and 
power (CHP) plants and heaters to generate process 
heat (e.g., steam), but would still meet less than 5% 
of the industry sector’s total fuel demand. To utilize 
these potentials from limited use today requires significant efforts from the industry sector.
— Transport: The government is promoting the production of advanced biofuels from sustainable feedstocks. REmap 2030 envisages production rising from 
2.5 billion to 37 billion litres. Already today around 
200 million electric two and three-wheelers are on the 
road in China, by 2030 this could reach 500 million. The 
magnitude of growth in advanced biofuels production 
represents a challenge.
Renewable energy options other than biomass: Realising the biomass potential in REmap 2030 would 
require at least two-thirds of China’s total biomass supply potential to be utilized. Solar thermal for heating 
and different forms of electric transport are renewable 
energy technology options other than biomass. China is 
a global leader in solar thermal, and could increase its 
installed capacity six-fold under REmap 2030: 30% in 
manufacturing, and 70% in residential and commercial 
buildings. Electric vehicles already carry hundreds of 
millions of passengers every year, and could meet up to 
20% of projected car demand by 2030, and as China’s 
power system becomes more renewable, so will the 
electricity these technologies consume.
The cost of REmap 2030
The investment needed to achieve REmap 2030 would 
average USD 145 billion per year, between now and 2030. 
This is an increase of USD 54 billion per year in investments 
in renewable energy technologies over current projections.
REmap quantifies costs from two perspectives: those of 
businesses, and those of governments.
● From the business perspective, which includes enduser tax and subsidies, REmap Options could be 
deployed at an average incremental cost of USD 20.2 per megawatt-hour (MWh), or USD 5.6 per gigajoule 
(GJ).
● From the government perspective, which excludes 
energy tax and subsidies, the cost would rise to USD 
24.8 per MWh (USD 6.9 per GJ). This translates to a 
bottom line additional cost of USD 58 billion per year 
for the entire energy system.
● When externalities are taken into account, such as 
human health and CO2 emission reductions, REmap 
2030 results in net savings of USD 55-228 billion per 
year.
Reducing CO2 emissions
China is the world’s largest emitter of CO2, driven by 
its use of coal. Its power and end-use sectors produce 
around 7 Gt of CO2 per year in 2012, and under business 
as usual scenario, this will grow by 50% by 2030. REmap 
2030 shows that it is possible to limit this growth to 25% 
by substituting coal, mainly in the power sector.
However, even with the potential of renewables estimated in this study, China’s coal use by 2030 will be very 
similar to its current levels. China will need to continue 
to deploy renewables beyond 2030, and improve energy efficiency in end-use sectors, in order to transition 
to a sustainable energy system.
If REmap Options were achieved worldwide, coupled 
with higher energy efficiency, atmospheric CO2 concentration would stay below 450 parts per million (ppm) 
of CO2 helping to prevent average global temperatures 
from rising more than two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.
Policy needs
REmap 2030 provides several recommendations to 
accelerate the transition to renewable energy. They 
include:
Renewable energy policy:
● Develop a comprehensive national energy plan that 
accounts for the needed infrastructure for transmission and distribution of electricity, heat and gas
● Introduce taxation, caps, and/or CO2 trading systems 
to account for the damage of CO2 emission and 
other air pollution from coal combustion
● Assess the socio-economic, energy security, health, 
land and water use impact of various technologies
● Set targets for renewables in manufacturing, buildings and transport
Power supply system and market design:
● Establish the national power market, creating economic incentives for flexible operation, and bringing 
in new investors
● Develop the grid to better integrate renewable energy, enhance trade and deal with variability
Technology focused policies:
● Enhance government support for innovation, research and development to reduce renewable energy costs
● Support development of next-generation renewable 
energy technologies
● Improve knowledge and data collection on biomass 
and develop a working biomass feedstock market
China’s energy use has grown rapidly in recent years, 
and by 2030 it will increase by another 60%. In 
a business as usual scenario, the country will not 
only be the world’s largest energy consumer by far, 
but also emit over twice the quantity of CO2 of the 
next largest emitter. Without increased deployment 
of renewable energy, China’s energy system will 
continue to result in high levels of air pollution, 
negatively affecting health, economic growth and 
the environment. Without the diversification of its 
energy system and a transition towards renewable 
energy, the country will become increasingly reliant 
on imported fossil fuels, affecting its national energy 
security and economic growth.
China can choose a different path by accelerating 
the shift to renewable energy. There are challenges, 
including enhancing grid and transmission 
infrastructure, as well as biomass collection and 
logistics. These challenges can be overcome through 
effective planning and by creating mechanisms that 
value the external benefits of renewable energy. 
If China acts decisively to increase the role of 
renewables in its energy system, it can significantly 
reduce the pollution of its environment, enhance 
its energy security, benefit its economy and play a 
leading role in mitigating climate change. 1 INTRODUCTION
Renewable Energy Centre (CNREC) estimates, China’s 
share of modern renewables in the TFEC will grow from 
just 7% in 2010 to only 16% in 2030 (excluding traditional 
uses of biomass3).
China has significant potential to go beyond its Reference Case if all the potential renewable energy technologies identified in REmap are deployed in addition 
to the Reference Case (IRENA, 2014a). The deployment 
of technologies required to fill this gap are called the 
REmap Options. Given the size of the country, renewable energy technologies and their related potentials 
vary by region and include geothermal, wind and various forms of solar and biomass. Annex G provides maps 
of the distribution of various energy sources and their 
potential.
This national potential is of global importance. Figure 1 
provides a breakdown of total renewable energy use 
across the 26 countries that have developed REmap 
Options. Six of these countries account for three-quarters of the total additional renewable energy potential 
and more than half of the worldwide REmap Options. 
China has the largest renewable energy potential worldwide, accounting for 20% of the total global potential. 
The engagement of China is essential if the goal of 
doubling the share of global renewable energy use is to 
be achieved.
The objective of this report is to provide detailed background data and the results of the China REmap country 
analysis, as well as to make suggestions as to how these 
results could be translated into action.
The report starts with a brief description of the 
REmap 2030 methodology (Section 2). It continues 
by explaining the present energy situation and recent 
trends for renewable energy use (Section 3). Section 
4 provides details of the China Reference Case find3 Estimates for traditional uses of biomass vary widely depending on 
the source. For a detailed breakdown of the information available, 
see Section 3 and Annex I.
REmap 2030 is the global renewable energy roadmap 
of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) 
that shows how accelerated penetration of renewable 
energy in individual countries could contribute to doubling the share of renewables in the global energy mix 
by 2030.
Key factors in achieving a doubling are the use of 
biomass for heating, power generation and biofuels, as 
well as wind and solar technologies and greater electrification of the energy sector. Based on the analysis 
of 26 countries, REmap 2030 suggests that existing 
and future renewable energy expansion, as currently 
planned, will result in a 21% share of renewables worldwide in 2030 (IRENA, 2014a). This leaves a 15 percentage-point gap to achieve the doubling – 36% renewable 
energy share in the global total final energy consumption (The World Bank, 2013).
REmap 2030 is the result of a collaborative process 
between IRENA, national REmap experts within the 
individual countries and other stakeholders. The current report focuses on the actual and potential role of 
renewable energy in China, a major energy producer 
and consumer, and a major contributor of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. In 2010, China was the largest 
energy consumer in the world with a total final energy 
consumption (TFEC) of 57 exajoules (EJ) per year (or 
1,950 million tonnes of coal equivalent, Mtce)1, equivalent to 18% of the global TFEC (IEA, 2012a).
China’s TFEC is projected to grow by 60% in the period between 2010 and 2030, according to the New 
Policies Scenario in the International Energy Agency’s 
World Energy Outlook (WEO) 2012 (IEA, 2012a)2. In the 
same time period, according to IEA and China National 
1 1 tce is equivalent to 29.3 GJ. 1 EJ is equivalent to 109 GJ or 
34.1 Mtce.
2 The Reference Case of China has been prepared based on the IEA’s 
WEO 2012 which projects 5% lower TFC compared with the IEA’s 
WEO 2013 projection of 103 EJ in 2030 (IEA, 2013a). However, 
the growth rates for 2010-2030 and 2011-2030 are similar in both 
projections, estimated at approximately 2.2% per year.ings – the business-as-usual. Section 5 discusses the 
current policy framework. Section 6 discusses the 
potential of different renewable energy resources in 
China. Section 7, the heart of the report, quantifies 
the REmap Options – the potential to go beyond the 
uptake of renewable energy sources outlined in the 
Reference Case. This is followed by a discussion of the 
opportunities and barriers for renewable energy use 
in China (Section 8).
Section 9 provides policy recommendations for an 
accelerated renewable energy uptake for China.

10%2 METHODOLOGY AND DATA SOURCES
2030 is an exploratory study, not a target-setting exercise.
The sources of the REmap Options for China originate 
from a range of research that includes:
● For power sector: CNREC estimates, historical 
trends, IEA China Wind Energy roadmap (IEA, 
2011a) and IRENA renewable energy industry 
roadmap and its accompanying data were used 
(IRENA, 2014b)
● For transport sector: IRENA estimates were used
● For industry sector: a recent IRENA renewable 
energy in industry roadmap (IRENA, 2014b) and 
its accompanying data was used
● For building sector: an internal analysis of Reference Case developments and REmap Options 
was used in addition to the draft “Roadmap 
Research of China Solar Thermal Development” 
(Ruicheng, Tao and Xuan, 2014)
IRENA developed a REmap tool that allows staff and 
external experts to input data in an energy balance 
for 2010, 2020 and 2030, and then assess technology 
options that could be deployed by 2030 consistent 
with an accelerated deployment of renewable energy. 
In addition to what is provided in the Annexes of this 
report, a detailed list of these technologies and the 
related background data are provided online. The tool 
includes the cost (capital, operation and maintenance) 
and technical performance (reference capacity of 
installation, capacity factor and conversion efficiency) 
of renewable and conventional (fossil fuel, nuclear and 
traditional use of biomass) technologies for each sector 
analysed: industry, buildings, transport, power and 
district heat.
Each renewable energy technology is characterized 
by its costs and the cost of each REmap Option is 
represented by its substitution cost. Substitution costs 
are the difference between the annualised cost of the 
REmap Option and of a conventional technology used 
to produce the same amount of energy, divided by the 
total renewable energy use in final energy terms (in 
2010 real US Dollar (USD) per gigajoule (GJ) of final reThis section explains the REmap 2030 methodology 
and provides information about the background data 
used for the analysis of China. Annexes A-F provide the 
data and background assumptions in greater detail.
REmap is an analytical approach for assessing the gap 
between current national renewable energy plans, additional renewable technology options potentially available in 2030 and Sustainable Energy for All’s (SE4All) 
objective of doubling the share of global renewable 
energy by 2030.
REmap 2030 assesses 26 countries: Australia, Brazil, 
Canada, China (in the present study), Denmark, Ecuador, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, 
Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Tonga, Turkey, Ukraine, 
the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the 
United States of America.
The analysis starts with national-level data covering 
both end-use (buildings, industry and transport) and 
the power and district heat sectors. Current national 
plans using 2010 as the base year of this analysis are 
the starting point4. The Reference Case represents policies in place or under consideration, including energy 
efficiency improvements if they are contained in these 
projections. The Reference Case includes the TFEC of 
each end-use sector and the total generation of power 
and district heat sectors, with a breakdown by energy 
carrier for the period 2010–2030. The Reference Case 
for China was based on CNREC estimates and the IEA’s 
WEO 2012 New Policies Scenario. Where necessary, 
2010 IEA energy balance for China has been updated 
with information originating from other national sources 
or own estimates. This was the case in particular for the 
traditional use of biomass in the residential sector.
Once the Reference Case was prepared, then additional 
technology options were identified. These are defined 
as REmap Options. The choice of an options approach 
instead of a scenarios approach is deliberate: REmap

years (e.g., 2012, 2013) is provided where relevant.newable energy)5. This indicator provides a comparable 
metric for all renewable energy technologies identified 
in each sector.
Substitution costs are the key indicators for assessing 
the economic viability of REmap Options. They depend 
on the type of conventional technology substituted, 
energy prices and the characteristics of the REmap 
Option. The cost can be positive (incremental) or negative (savings), as many renewable energy technologies 
are already or could be cost-effective compared with 
conventional technologies by 2030 as a result of technological learning and economies of scale.
Based on the substitution cost and the potential of 
each REmap Option, country cost supply curves were 
developed from two perspectives for the year 2030: 
government and business. In the government perspective, costs exclude energy taxes and subsidies, and a 
standard 10% discount rate was used, which allows 
comparison across countries. Estimating a government 
perspective allows for a comparison of the 26 REmap 
countries with each other and for a country cost-benefit 
analysis; the government perspective shows the cost of 
doubling the global renewable energy share as governments would calculate it.
For the business perspective, the process was repeated 
to include national prices (including, for example, energy taxes, subsidies and a national cost of capital of 8% 
for China in order to generate a national cost curve. This 
approach shows the cost of the transition as businesses 
and investors would calculate it. Assessment of all additional costs related to complementary infrastructure, 
such as transmission lines, reserve power needs, energy 
storage or fuel stations, are excluded from this study. 
However, where relevant we discuss the implications of 
infrastructure needs on total system costs based on a 
review of comparable literature.
Throughout this study, renewable energy share is estimated related to TFEC6. Based on TFEC, the renewable 
energy share can be estimated for the total of all end5 1 Chinese Yuan Renminbi was equivalent to 6.8 US Dollars in 2010.
6 Renewable energy share is estimated by dividing the total final 
renewable energy use by the TFEC. Total final renewable energy 
use includes: (i) total fuel use in end-use sectors to generate heat 
(process heat, space/water heating, cooking, etc.); (ii) motor fuels 
in the transport sector; and (iii) total power and district heat consumption generated from renewable sources.
use sectors of China or for each of its end-use sectors 
(with and without the contribution of renewable electricity and district heat). The share of renewable power 
and district heat generation is also calculated. Further 
details of the REmap 2030 methodology can be found 
online in IRENA’s REmap webpage at: www.irena.org/
remap.
This report also discusses the finance needs and avoided externalities related to renewable energy. Three financial indicators are developed, namely net incremental system costs, net incremental investment needs and 
subsidy needs. These indicators are briefly defined as:
1) Net incremental system costs: This is the sum of 
the differences between the total capital (in USD/
year) and operating expenditures (in USD/year) 
of all energy technologies based on their deployment in REmap 2030 and the Reference Case in 
the period 2010-2030 for each year.
2) Net incremental investment needs: This is the 
difference between the annual investment needs 
of all REmap Options and the investment needs 
of the substituted conventional technologies 
which would otherwise be invested in. Investment needs for renewable energy capacity are 
estimated for each technology by multiplying its 
total deployment (in gigawatts, GW) to deliver 
the same energy service as conventional capacity and the investment costs (in USD per kilowatt, 
kW) for the period 2010-2030. This total is then 
annualized by dividing the number of years covered in the analysis (i.e., 20 years between 2010 
and 2030).
3) Subsidy needs: Total subsidy requirements for 
renewables are estimated as the difference in the 
delivered energy service costs for the REmap 
Option (in USD/GJ final energy) relative to its 
conventional counterpart multiplied by its deployment in a given year (in petajoules (PJ) per 
year).
In addition to the investment and subsidy needs, external effects related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission 
reductions as well as improvements in outdoor and 
indoor air pollution from the decreased use of fossil 
fuels have been estimated. As a first step, GHG emissions from fossil fuel combustion are estimated for each 
sector and energy carrier. For this purpose, the energy 
content of each type of fossil fuel was multiplied by its default emission factors (based on lower heating values, LHV) as provided by the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change (Eggleston et al., 2006). Emissions 
were estimated separately for the Reference Case and 
REmap 2030. The difference between the two estimates 
yields the total net GHG emission reduction from fossil 
fuel combustion due to increased renewable energy use. 
To evaluate the related external costs related to carbon 
emissions, a carbon price range of USD 20 to 80 per 
tonne of CO2 is assumed (IPCC, 2007). This range was 
applied only to CO2 emissions, but not other greenhouse 
gases. According to the IPCC (2007), the carbon price 
should reflect the social cost of mitigating one tonne of 
CO2 equivalent GHG emissions.
The external costs related to human health are estimated in a separate step, which excludes any effect 
related to GHG emissions. Outdoor air pollution is evaluated from the following sources: 1) outdoor emission of 
sulphur dioxide (SO2), mono-nitrogen oxides (NOx) and 
particulate matter of less than 2.5 micrometres (PM2.5) 
from fossil fuel-based power plant operation, and 2) 
outdoor emissions of NOx, and PM2.5 from road vehicles. 
To evaluate the external costs related to outdoor emission of SO2, NOx and PM2.5 from fossil power plant operation, the following parameters for respective pollutants 
were used: (a) emission factor (i.e., tonne per kWh for 
2010 and 2030 taken from the IIASA GAINS database 
ECRIPSE scenario (IIASA, 2014)), and (b) unit external 
costs (i.e., Euro-per-tonne average for the European 
Union (EU), adapted for China from the EU CAFE project (AEA, 2005)). Values for the potential differences 
in external effects between the EU and China are accounted for based on the difference in gross domestic 
product (GDP).

analysis can be found online7.
7 www.irena.org/remap Key points
● The renewable energy share in China’s total final 
energy consumption stood at 13% in 2010, the 
base year of REmap 2030 analysis.
● Hydroelectric (hydro) accounted for 85% of total 
renewable power generation in China in 2013, 
a share that has fallen as other forms of power 
generation have been rolled out. Wind power 
is growing significantly and in 2013 China had 
77 gigawatts-electric (GWe) of installed wind capacity. As a result, wind now accounts for nearly 
a quarter of total renewable power generation in 
2013 in China.
● Modern and traditional uses of biomass are estimated to account, together, for more than half 
of China’s total renewable energy use today. 
However, there are large uncertainties around the 
actual consumption of traditional forms of biomass. Based on the review of existing literature 
and bottom-up analysis, this study adopted the 
mean value of the estimated range of 1 EJ-8 EJ, 
i.e. 4 EJ (136 Mtce).
● China has a long history of developing biogas for 
households that stretches back to the 1960s, with 
total investments reaching nearly USD 15 billion 
between 2003 and 2012. About 50 million households use a total of 16 billion cubic metres of 
biogas per year today.
● China has the largest solar thermal capacity in 
the world, accounting for two-thirds of the total 
global capacity of 270 gigawatts-thermal (GWth) 
in 2012. All of this capacity is located in the building sector.
● There are important regional differences. Wind 
generation is concentrated in the northwest and 
northeast. Utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) 
generation is concentrated in the northern and 
western parts of China. Distributed solar PV is 
picking up, with a shift that started in 2013 and is 
expected to continue, mainly in eastern parts of 
China. Biomass, depending on the type of feedstock, agricultural residues and waste available, 
is concentrated in central and northern parts of 
the country and residual forested areas in various 
parts of China.
This section discusses the current energy situation of 
China at the level of sector and energy carriers. It also 
provides a brief overview of the latest renewable energy 
development and capacity additions.
3.1 Status of renewable energy 
development
Power sector
By 2013, China exceeded the United States in terms of 
total electric power generation capacity. In 2013 alone, 
overall capacity grew by 8% on the previous year, to 
1,234 gigawatt-electric (GWe). China’s power generation 
capacity is expected to more than double by 2030 or 
even before.
Renewable energy projects have taken an increasingly 
important share of this total. Figure 2 shows the increase in total renewable energy power plant capacities 
in China between 2005 and 2013. Total installed renewable capacity reached 380 GWe in 20138. Installed capacity has more than tripled since 2005.
With an installed hydroelectricity generating capacity of 
280 GWe
9 at the end of 2013, China remains the world’s 
leading investor in hydro (CNREC, 2014). As a result,

9 This includes more than 50,000 small-scale hydroelectricity 
facilities with a total installed capacity of around 67 gigawatts.
3 RECENT TRENDS FOR RENEWABLE 
ENERGY AND THE PRESENT ENERGY 
SITUATIONhydro accounted for nearly three-quarters of the total 
installed renewable power generation capacity in China.
Ten provinces account for more than 70% of total power 
production from hydro (CNREC, 2013a). One third of 
all provinces and a quarter of the population relies on 
small hydroelectricity for power supply. China’s capacity 
of small-scale hydro is also the world’s largest. In 2012, 
China had 34.3 GWe of distributed energy capacity, of 
which small hydro accounted for 26.7 GWe (not all small 
hydro is considered distributed energy). Distributed 
energy is also viewed as a way to improve rural incomes 
and supply irrigation.
Most major Chinese hydroelectricity developers are 
state-owned enterprises: Sino Hydro Group has developed 65% of China’s hydroelectricity projects. Private 
companies have thus far had difficulty entering this 
market. However, Hanergy, a private company focused 
on hydroelectricity, wind and solar development, is the 
builder of the Jin’anqiao, Mujing, Huangtian, Wulanghe 
and Kunlong hydroelectricity plants.
Installed capacity today accounts for only around 40% 
of its technical potential, well below the average across 
the developed countries. It was planned for hydro to 
reach 420 GWe by 2020, including 70 GWe of pump 
storage (WRI, 2014). Realizing this target would require 
the construction of more than 50 large-scale dams on 
the Jinsha, Yalong, Dadu, Lancang and Yarlung Tsangpo 
rivers.
Hydroelectricity is followed by wind. Wind power investments have accelerated in recent years, as shown in 
Figure 2. As of the end of 2013, total installed capacity 
had reached 91.4 GWe; making China the world’s leading 
user of wind energy (GWEC, 2014a). The gap between 
newly installed capacity and new additions to the grid 
has also narrowed in the past three years, with 77.1 GWe 
of the total installed capacity now connected to electricity distribution grids.
After the six-fold growth of total generation capacity 
between 2008 and 2013, wind power had become the 
third largest source of Chinese power production after

Note: Excludes distributed solar PV capacity which reached 5 gigawatts in 2013 (CNREC, 2014).
Since 2013, China has the largest total electric power production capacity worldwide which is 
expected to more than double by 2030thermal and hydro, albeit accounting for only 2.5% of 
the total. This suggests there is considerable room for 
the industry to grow. Between 2010 and 2012, newly 
added capacity averaged 15 GWe per year. The size 
of wind parks is also increasing. In 2012, average unit 
capacity had reached 1.4 megawatts-electric (MWe), 
double the figure in 2005 (CNREC, 2013a).
As of 2013, the total number of wind turbine projects in 
the pipeline were equivalent to 60.2 GWe of additional 
capacity. If these can be completed and connected to 
the grid in the next 2-3 years, it is expected to nearly 
double China’s total installed on-grid wind power generation capacity (CREIA, 2014a).
Private and foreign ownership in the sector remains 
limited, accounting for 5% and 1% of total wind capacity, respectively. About 80% of the total is state-owned, 
while 14% is accounted for by Sino-foreign joint ventures 
(CNREC, 2013a).
North China accounts for about 70% of the total installed wind capacity. Hebei and Gansu provinces also 
have high installed capacities: 7.1 GWe and 6.3 GWe, 
respectively (CNREC, 2013a; Perera, 2014).
Wind power is the third largest source of 
electricity in China, although it still only 
accounts for 2.5% of the total
China had installed 390 MWe of offshore wind power by 
the end of 2012, with the majority in Jiangsu Province 
and Shanghai City, where all facilities have been connected to the grid. Two-thirds of the total capacity was 
located in intertidal zones where Donghai Bridge (close 
to Shanghai) is the largest single location with the largest capacity (102 MWe). The remaining projects mostly 
consist of small prototypes for demonstration and testing purposes (Carbontrust, 2014). The biggest offshore 
demonstration project in China had a total capacity of 
150 MWe in Jiangsu Rudong. Other installations are the 
second phase of the 65.6 MWe Donghai Bridge project, 
with 8.6 MWe installed in 2011 (GWEC, 2014b; WP, 2013).
There are also an increasing number of solar PV projects in China. Installed generation capacity based on 
solar PV has increased considerably in recent years. The 
period from 2010 to 2012 saw a nearly tenfold increase, 
from 0.8 GWe to 7 GWe. In 2012 alone, about 4 GWe – 
more than the total installed over the previous five years 
– was added.

Source: CWEA (2014); CHPDI (2014)Driven by a new target of 35 GWe by 2015 – an increase 
of 40% from its previous target of 21 GWe – announced 
at the very beginning of 2013, and partly by the ending 
of a 16 US cents per kWh feed-in tariff (FiT) for large 
grid-connected PV projects, the record of the annual 
new addition of installed capacity was reset at nearly 
13 GWe by 2013. This makes the total installed capacity 
19.6 GWe including 16.3 GWe of ground-mounted solar 
PV systems and 3.1 GWe of distributed solar.
Following the strong momentum seen in 2013, a new 
target was set in May 2014 of 70 GWe by 2017 in the context of the Action Plan on Prevention and Control of Air 
Pollution. This target indicates that the record growth of 
13 GWe a year would have to be sustained for the next 
four years (SolarServer, 2014). Although the addition 
of distributed solar PV generation capacity in 2013 was 
about 800 MWe, the new goal set for 2014 is to install 
8 GWe of distributed solar PV as opposed to 6 GWe
ground-mounted utility-scale solar PV farms (CREIA, 
2014b). It highlights the importance of distributed solar 
PV as well as the development of utility-scale solar PV 
in western China (Haugwitz, 2014), in the context that 
distributed solar PV accounts for about 38% of the total 
installed. However, in the first half of 2014 only 2.3 GWe
of ground-mounted utility scale capacity was installed 
while about 1 GWe of distributed generation solar PV 
was installed, but with another 3 GWe at least commissioned in the same time period. If the targets set for 
2014 are to be achieved, considerable efforts need to be 
made in the near future.
Qinghai, Xinjiang, Tibet, Inner Mongolia, Sichuan and 
Gansu Provinces account for the largest share of installed solar PV capacities, given they represent more 
than two thirds of the national solar energy resource 
potential (CNREC, 2013a).
Concentrated solar power (CSP) has only recently been 
introduced in China. In 2011, there were five approved 
projects under construction. Their total capacity is 
342.5 MWe and all of them use parabolic trough technology. Plants are located across Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia and Qinghai (Eurobserv’er, 2014; ESTELA, 
2012). Expected installed capacity growth to 2018 is 
1.4 GWe, mainly driven by the 12th five-year plan (FYP) 
(2011-2015) (for which the target is 1 GWe), the ample 
availability of low-cost financing and flexibility from 
hybridisation with coal or storage (IEA, 2013c). By 2020, 
China aims to have 3 GWe of installed CSP capacity.
Two CSP projects, each with a capacity of 50 MWe, received total lending of USD 250 million (RMB 1.7 billion) 
from the Asia Development Bank. One of them was in 
Qinghai, which received USD 150 million (estimated to 
produce 197 GWh annually); the other was in Gansu, 
which received USD 100 million (parabolic). The loans 
were made in 2013 and 2014, respectively (Lee, 2014).
In August 2014, NDRC set a tariff of USD 19.2 cents per 
kWh for the first CSP project, the Delingha installation 
operated by SUPCON Group, which has a designed 
capacity of 50 MWe. Phase I, worth 10 MWe, has been 
in commercial operation since early 2013. The nearly 
two-year-long operation has provided data for policy 
makers to set future tariffs. The current tariff is not as 
high as the CSP industry had expected, suggesting that 
future FiTs for CSP will be differentiated from those 
for PV projects. This would be of great significance for 
the CSP industry as the previous prevailing wisdom 
was that the same level of tariffs would be applied to 
both forms of solar power plant. It is estimated that a 
universal tariff structure for CSP will not likely be issued 
until a few projects are up and running and generating 
sufficient amounts of operational data on which to base 
a judgement.
The relatively low tariffs for the pilot CSP projects might 
also reflect an attempt to encourage the use of local 
components. Currently, the two biggest challenges 
facing the Chinese CSP industry include resource assessment and system optimisation. It has been widely 
acknowledged that the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) 
would be decreased dramatically if and when Chinese 
manufacturing capacities in CSP increase. This might 
bring the technology back to the table.
The first CSP pilot project was subject to a 
comparatively low feed-in tariff, indicating 
that policy makers are keen to encourage 
investment in the sector
Installed biomass power generation capacity increased 
from 1.4 GWe in 2006 to 8.5 GWe in 2013. After hydro it 
was the second largest form of renewable capacity installed until 2007, before wind caught up. The majority 
of biomass capacity is in eastern China, with Shandong 
alone accounting for 14% of the total. Henan, Jiangsu, 
Heilongjiang and Hubei each have around 500 MWe
capacity installed as well (CNREC, 2013a).Biomass installed capacity numbers vary by source. 
Half of the total installed capacity (4.1 GWe) today is accounted for by agriculture and forestry biomass direct 
combustion power generation plants. At the end of 2012 
there were 100 such steam cycle plants in operation, 
most with a unit capacity of 12 MWe but some with up 
to 50 MWe. A quarter (2.3 GWe) of this capacity comes 
from waste incineration, around 0.3 GWe is from biogas. 
1.2 GWe from sludge and biomass gasification power 
generation, and 1.7 GWe from bagasse power plants10
(CNREC, 2014). Biomass co-firing is limited. Government has set a target of 30 GWe for biomass-based 
power by 2020.
Power generation from modern biomass was about 
34 TWh in 2012 (using around 0.5 EJ biomass). Solid biomass use for power generation is projected to increase 
to 0.7 EJ in 2015, while biogas will grow to 0.5 EJ, solid 
biomass for heating to 0.18 EJ and biofuels to 0.18 EJ 
(total 1.6 EJ).
The target for biomass power generation is 13 GWe by 
2015. This includes 8 GWe agricultural/forestry residues, 
3 GWe municipal solid waste and 2 GWe biogas. This 
could double power generation from 2012 levels of 
34 TWh/year.
European high-pressure, high-temperature technology 
has been adapted to the Chinese market. Such boilers 
can achieve efficiencies of up to 32%. China has mature 
combustion technologies. There are plants with up to 
50 MWe capacity in operation. Three high temperature 
and ultra-high pressure circulating fluid bed boilers have 
been in operation since 2012 (Van Sambeek et al., 2013). 
Manufacturing in China has reduced engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) costs from USD 2,500 
per kW in Europe to USD 1,000 to 1,200 per kW for the 
same base technology. Special attention is needed for 
fuel handling and fuel feeding, combustion, boiler and 
flue gas cleaning (Brendstrup, 2012).
10 Bagasse is a by-product of the sugar cane industry. Sugar cane 
production of China amounted to about 110 Mt/year in 2010. This 
yields approximately 36 Mt/year bagasse (with 40-50% moisture 
content). This is equivalent to 300 PJ per year bagasse generation. This is used for on-site power generation in a total installed 
capacity of 800-1,700 MWe today; that is equivalent to about 
50-100 PJ/year bagasse demand which means only 15-35% of the 
actual amount generated was utilised.
Investments in biomass have increased 
steadily, aided by European technology 
and reduced engineering, procurement and 
construction costs
With extensive but low-temperature geothermal 
resources (30-90o C in most locations), China has 
since 1999 been the world’s largest user of geothermal 
energy for non-electric applications such as space 
heating and recreation. A few locations have the 
potential for high-temperature geothermal use, 
notably in southern Tibet, western Yunnan and western 
Sichuan, located on the Himalayan Geothermal Belt. 
However, it remains uncertain whether these resources 
could be exploited in an economically viable and 
environmentally benign manner. As a result, China’s 
geothermal power generation capacity has hovered 
around 27 MWe for many years (CNREC, 2014). The 
largest project, Yangbajing Geothermal Power Plant, 
is located in Tibet with a total capacity of 25.2 MWe
and has been in operation since 1977 (built between 
1977 and 1991, starting with a 1 MWe capacity). Many 
other plants with much smaller capacities existed in 
Tibet, Guangdon and Hunan but have since ceased 
operation.
No major developments in the sector have taken place 
in China since 1992 (Worldview, 2012). However, geothermal potential for power generation is estimated at 
between 50 MWe and 90 MWe in Yangbajain (Bertani, 
2010) and China aims to arrive at a total installed capacity of 60 MWe by 2015 (GEA, 2012).
Transport sector
In the transport sector, two main technology options 
are liquid biofuels and electric mobility. Fuel ethanol 
production in China doubled between 2005 and 2012, 
reaching a total of 2.5 billion litres (CNREC, 2013a). Biodiesel production in China is rather limited, with about 
0.5 million tonnes from a total production capacity of 
3 million tonnes in 2009, and production levels remaining stagnant today (Qiu et al., 2012; USDA, 2012; CNREC, 
2013a).
Cane, sweet sorghum and cassava can be used for ethanol production. However, the government is concerned 
about food versus fuel competition. For this reason, 
ambitious plans for transportation biofuel production 
based on food crops have been abandoned; instead at-tention has focused on advanced biofuels. Of 100 such 
projects worldwide, 18 of are located in China, which 
accounts for 40% of the potential capacity (an annual 
production capacity of 2.5 billion litres per year) (IFPEN, 
2013).
The first cassava ethanol plant in the world was built in 
Guangxi in 2007. The plant has an annual production 
capacity of 250 million litres per year. Another ethanol 
plant using sweet sorghum as feedstock was completed 
in 2012 in Inner Mongolia with a total capacity of 
64 million litres per year (USDA, 2013). COFCO/Sinopec 
with Novozymes as partner is investing in Zhaodong 
to produce ethanol from agricultural residues with a 
total capacity of 64 million litres per year. There are 
also two other projects, one in Shanghai and another in 
Caofeidian, each with an annual capacity of 0.4 million 
litres, which aim to produce ethanol from waste carbon 
monoxide from steel mills. The plant in Shanghai is 
expected to expand its production to 120 million litres 
per year (AEC, 2013; E2, 2013). There is a plant in 
Shengguan based on corn cob residues available onsite 
(originally a corn to furfural company) with 22 million 
litres per year capacity. Another plant with 56  million 
litre capacity in Longlif (originally a conventional biofuel 
company) also uses corn cobs as feedstock. A smaller 
plant with 11 million litre-per-year capacity runs in 
Hennan Shengguan. Finally, another plan in the Anhui 
province is to invest in a biorefinery for the production 
of ethanol, bioglycols and power from a mix of wheat 
straw, corn storver and lignin co-products (Biomass 
Magazine, 2013).
In addition, a shift in transport modes, such as the use 
of high-speed trains with renewable power instead of 
diesel-based trucks or city trams for passenger cars, are 
other options for the transport sector.
Other end-use sectors
In buildings and the manufacturing industry, conventional fuels used to generate space and water heating, 
cooking and process heating can be substituted with 
a range of technologies. These include solar thermal, 
geothermal heat, heat pumps and biomass-based heat. 
All of these technologies are already deployed in China 
and have significant further potential. The main challenge is the substitution of traditional uses of biomass 
in China with modern forms of bioenergy and other 
renewables.
3.2 Base year renewable energy 
situation
Sector-level breakdown
In 2010, China consumed 100 EJ of total primary energy 
(3,410 Mtce) (excluding non-energy use of around 5 EJ) 
(IEA, 2013a)11, 12. In final energy terms, China’s total energy demand in 2010 was 57 EJ (1,950 Mtce) of which 
59% was consumed by industry, 21% by the building 
sector and 13% by the transport sector (Figure 4). Electricity accounted for 20% of the TFEC of which 75% was 
consumed in the industrial sector, with the remainder 
used mainly in buildings. District heat is also important 
for China. Its production had increased to 3 EJ in 2010. 
It provides about 4% of the TFEC in each of the industry 
and building sectors. About 70% of the total district 
heat demand was consumed in the industrial sector.
The breakdown of TFEC at a sector level has changed 
in the past three decades (IEA, 2013a). In the 1980s 
building energy demand accounted for more than half 
of TFEC and the transport sector had a share of around 
only 5-6%. The industry sector’s share was about 40%. 
In comparison, today industrial energy use accounts for 
more than half of China’s total energy demand, while 
the share of the transport sector has tripled to 15% at 
the expense of the building sector, which now only accounts for 30%.
Modern and traditional forms of renewable energy accounted for 13% of the TFEC in 2010. It is not easy to 
make a distinction between the amount of biomass 
used in its traditional and modern forms – depending 
on the sources used, the traditional use of biomass in 
China ranges anywhere from 1 EJ to 8 EJ (see Annex I 
for further details). When this amount is excluded from 
the mix, modern renewables account for 7% of TFEC 
(IEA, 2013a)
Renewable energy use is concentrated in the end-use 
sectors. When excluding electricity and district heat 
11 According to CNREC (2013a), the total primary energy consumption of China in 2012 was 3,620 Mtce, which is approximately 
106 EJ.
12 Primary energy consumption refers to the direct use or supply 
of all energy carriers (e.g., crude oil) without being converted or 
transformed to another form of energy (e.g., heat). It is therefore 
higher than TFEC, which only looks at the consumption of energy 
carriers such as fuels for the transport sector or electricity for appliances (see footnote 1).consumption, this amounted to 16% in the building sector. By comparison, renewable energy use is negligible 
in the industry and transport sectors13. When it comes 
to power generation, 19% of electricity sources were 
renewable, while in the district heat sector the share of 
renewable energy was only 1% in 2010.
Industry accounts for 62% of China’s total 
final energy consumption, the highest share 
amongst large economies, but industry 
sector has the least share of renewables in 
its fuel mix
The industrial sector is by far the largest energy user 
in China, accounting for 62% of its TFEC. It is projected 
that its share will fall slightly below current levels to between 50% and 55% by 2030.
Today, for nearly all bulk materials, such as cement, steel 
and textile fibres, China accounts for the largest share of 
production worldwide. The high importance of industry 
13 Providing the renewable energy share excluding power and district 
heat demand provides the contribution of renewable technologies 
in the sector’s total fuel use only. This is important to know to exclude the effect of renewable power and district heating which are 
often outside the boundaries of end-use sectors.
compared with other sectors is a specific feature of the 
Chinese energy system. The iron and steel sector was 
the largest industrial energy user, accounting for 40% of 
China’s TFEC. Other large industrial energy uses include 
non-metallic minerals (18%), chemicals and petrochemicals (12%) and machinery (6%) (IEA, 2013a).
Industry has a high demand for steam for different processes. However, the share of industrial combined heat 
and power (CHP) is rather low, with much of the process 
heat production coming from boilers (IEA, 2009).
In China most existing CHP production is based on coal. 
It is often integrated with municipal or industrial district 
heating systems or tied to power plants selling steam to 
nearby industrial sites or district heating loops. With investments in new capacity the overall efficiency of these 
systems are improving, but there are many industrial 
systems that are based on old, inefficient coal boilers 
and heating loops (average district heating boiler efficiency in China is 60 to 65%, while the heat loss from 
district heating pipelines is estimated to be between 
20% and as much as 50%) (IEA, 2009).
Besides their comparative lack of energy efficiency, 
these older forms of CHP also make the reduction

Source: IRENA estimates based on IEA (2013a)of pollution and GHG emissions a challenge. However, there is an opportunity for major GHG reductions 
through the use of localised, customer-based CHP at 
individual industrial facilities and in new commercial 
and residential developments – utilising more efficient 
and clean systems based on natural gas and renewable 
and waste fuels.
The application of cleaner forms of CHP at the 
local level could increase energy efficiency 
and help reduce air pollution
More than three quarters of the transport sector’s energy use is related to road transport. Domestic navigation 
accounts for another 8%. Rail transport, pipeline transport and domestic aviation together account for 13% of 
the transport sector’s TFEC (IEA, 2013a). More than half 
of the traffic is on highways (1,676 billion passengerkilometres out of the total of 3,098 in 2011). Aviation 
accounts for about 15% of the total passenger transport. 
Railways are increasingly gaining importance, with their 
share of total passenger transport reaching 30% in 2011. 
Nearly half of total freight movements were via navigation in 2011, with road transport accounting for a third 
and railways about 20% of the total (LBNL, 2013).
In 2011, the number of vehicles (excluding motorcycles 
and tractors) on the road has reached 93.6 million, of 
which 74.8 million are categorised as passenger vehicles. Trucks represented 17.9 million of the total civilian motor vehicle stock (LBNL, 2013). The demand for 
transportation is growing rapidly. In 2011, 18.5 million 
vehicles were sold. Further growth is expected but projections are uncertain, amounting to anywhere between 
25 million and 75 million cars in the long term (Economist, 2012). By 2030, the vehicle stock will have reached 
500-600 million vehicles, according to some estimates 
(Wang et al., 2013). Ma et al. (2012) project that the vehicle population in China will increase to 294 million in 
2030, with an average annual growth rate of 11%.
For intercity passenger transportation, the total traffic 
volume in 2030 will be around 7.6 trillion passengerkm, nearly three times the volume in 2010. The share of 
aviation in total passenger transportation is expected 
to double. In 2030, freight traffic volume could double 
compared to 2010. The share of railways could decrease 
from 30% to 19% the share of water transport could 
increase from 23% to 33%, and highways share to 48% 
(Ma et al., 2012).
After industry and transport, the building sector is 
the third largest user of energy. Residential energy 
use accounts for 86% of the total with the remainder 
accounted for by the commercial sector. Building 
energy consumption can be distinguished between 
urban residential, rural residential and the commercial 
sector.
Based on literature review, space heating accounts for 
about 30% of the total residential energy demand (including electricity use), with that share rising to at least 
50% for commercial buildings. More than half of the 
total energy demand is for cooking in rural areas (Zhou 
et al., 2007; PNNL, 2012; Xia, 2013; CPI, 2013). However, 
the breakdown of the data is largely dependent on how 
biomass is accounted for.
China has more than 20 billion square metres (m2) of rural residential building area. The urban residential building area is about 15 billion m2, while the total area for 
commercial buildings is about 8 billion m2 (CPI, 2013). 
Besides these total figures, attention should also be paid 
to China’s changing demographics and building use. On 
the one hand, the household size in China is decreasing: 
in 1980 the average size of a household was five people; 
in 2004, the figure was fewer than four. On the other 
hand, the dwelling area is increasing. For example, the 
period between 1980 and 2004 experienced a more 
than tripling of the area of the average household, from 
35 m2 to 100 m2 (Zhou et al., 2007).
More than half of the energy use in buildings 
in rural areas is for cooking, while nearly 
half of the total energy use in commercial 
buildings is for space heating
China has varying climate zones. The heating period 
in cold areas such as the northeast and west of the 
country can last for as long as 200 days. In other areas, 
it might be as few as 90 days (IEA, 2009). Total energy 
consumption for heating accounts for nearly a quarter 
of the total building sector energy demand. The total 
building heating area in China was about 8.8 billion m2
in 2008. About 38% of this is met by CHP central heating (3.3 billion m2), and another 36% by gas/coal boilerbased central heating (3.2 billion m2). The remaining 26% is provided by distributed systems which also 
include heat pumps and electric heating (2.3 billion m2) 
(Xia, 2013).
District heating for hot water is an important technology 
in China. Half of all major cities in China are connected 
to district heating systems. According to DEA (n.d.), 
district heating floor space has reached nearly 4.8 billion 
m2. This is more than triple the total area in 2001. This 
increase was a result of national policies and regulations 
as well as the use of surplus heat from the industrial 
sector. CHP is gaining a market share in district heat systems and today it accounts for more than half of the total district heating (DEA, n.d.; Euroheat & Power, 2013).
District heating capacity has increased by about a half in 
recent years, from 224 GWth in 2007 to 339 GWth in 2011. 
The increase in the length of heating pipelines grew by 
about the same percentage in the same period, from 
102,000 kms to 147,400 kms. The vast majority of all 
pipelines are used for hot water. The total heat supplied 
reached about 2.8 EJ in 2011, and can be split into 2.3 EJ 
hot water and 0.5 EJ steam. Hot water demand is increasing whereas the use of steam is slowly decreasing 
(Euroheat & Power, 2013).
By the end of 2010, China had some 38.5 million household-scale digesters, and around 27,500 large- and 
medium-scaled biogas plants for agricultural waste 
(Chen et al., 2012). Installations continue to grow apace. 
As of the end of 2012, China had nearly 50 million biogas 
cooking systems in place in rural areas.
Half of all major cities in China are connected 
to district heating systems, many of which are 
designed to use surplus heat from industry
Coal still plays a leading role in the energy industry 
of China. Around half of all coal is used for power 
generation, accounting for nearly 80% of the total of 
4,980 TWh/year generated in 2012. Total generation 
from natural gas and oil products was less than 2%, 
while nuclear accounted for 1.2%. Overall, installed 
fossil fuel and nuclear generation capacities in 2012 
were equivalent to 840 GWe, which is 71% of the total 
generation capacity of 1,144 GWe (CNREC, 2013a). As 
discussed earlier, renewable energy sources account 
for about 20% of power production, with hydro by far 
the biggest form of renewable, followed by wind and 
biomass.

In the residential sector, traditional and modern uses 
of biomass as a source of heating and cooking made 
up nearly all renewable energy used in 2010. Next to 
biomass, total installed solar thermal capacity for heating in the building sector in 2010 was 130 GWth (CNREC, 
2013a). Excluding traditional uses of biomass, the modern share of renewables was 16% of the sector’s total 
energy demand. In terms of fossil fuel products, 32% 
of the sector’s total energy demand was provided by 
similar amounts of coal and oil products. Natural gas 
accounted for 7% of demand (IEA, 2013b).
Oil products are the main sources of energy in the transport sector, accounting for more than 90% of the total 
demand, with smaller amounts of natural gas and coal 
providing the remainder. Around 2 billion litres of biofuels were consumed, which is less than 1% of the sector’s 
total energy demand.
Total biomass use in the industrial sector was limited 
to black liquor combustion of around 100 PJ per year. 
This quantity, which was excluded from the IEA energy 
statistics, is estimated based on total chemical pulp 
production of around 5 Mt per year. The sector relies 
heavily on coal to meet demand from energy-intensive 
industries such as steel and cement production.
Traditional uses of biomass
The traditional use of biomass in China deserves special 
attention because of its size as well as the difficulty 
in establishing reliable data due to the wide range of 
sources and variety of estimates. Worldwide, the number of people using solid fuels for cooking and heating 
has increased over the last decade to 3.2 billion, with 
about 2.4 billion using traditional biomass. Roughly 
800 million today use improved cooking stoves, partly 
due to efforts in the last two decades in China (Pachauri 
et al., 2012).
Biomass is the main source of energy in most provinces 
of rural China for space heating, cooking and water 
heating (An et al., 2014). In comparison, a negligible 
amount of biomass is used by the urban population in 
China. According to the IEA (based on World Health 
Organisation estimates), about 445 million people in 
China, who represent three-quarters of the total rural 
population, still rely on traditional uses of biomass (IEA, 
2013a). According to other sources (e.g., Zhang, Watanabe and Lin, 2010), the share of the total rural population relying on traditional uses of biomass in 2008-2009 
was 50-60%.
In China, between 1983 and 1996, improved cooking 
stoves were distributed to 177 million households. The 
energy efficiency of improved fuel wood stoves is between 20% and 30%. Although some studies suggest 
that these stoves are still mostly in use, it is unclear what 
their status and acceptability is (Pachauri et al., 2012).
Comparison of the literature shows that there is an important issue regarding the actual value of solid biomass 
used in China in traditional forms for cooking and heating in households. While there is no lack of information, 
the data vary widely from about 2 EJ to 8 EJ (see Table 1 
and Annex I).
While traditional uses of biomass are key in 
China’s energy mix, consistent and reliable 
data for the sector are still lacking
In addition to the statistical data, there is also literature 
which provides estimates for per capita consumption of 
energy in China. Based on the literature, and the share 
of the rural population relying on traditional use of biomass, total demand could range from between 0.8 EJ 
and 4.2 EJ (see Annex I).
Based on the comparison of various sources above, 
we assume that in the rural residential sector, 1.9 EJ 
(65  Mtce) of fuel wood and about 2 EJ (68 Mtce) of 
straw14 are used for cooking and heating today. Of this 
total amount of around 4 EJ (135 Mtce), we assumed 
that about 0.5 EJ (17 Mtce) is modern biomass used in 
efficient cookstoves15. However, this is certainly an area 
which requires further research and data collection.
14 According to Xiajiao (2012), 18% of the 700 Mt of total straw 
generated is used for energy purposes (1.6 EJ). According to 
Yishui and Liying (2011), 215 Mt is used for energy generation 
(2.7 EJ). According to Zhang (2014), 40% of a total of 350 Mt straw 
available for energy is already used (1.8 EJ).
15 The status of the 180 million modern cookstoves is unknown. Assuming that about 25-75 million are still in use with an average 
capacity of 1-3 kWth, total demand for modern biomass would be 
about 500 PJ/year on average in 2010.Conventional fuel markets
China’s economy is growing rapidly; its urbanisation 
rates have increased substantially in recent years and 
are expected to increase even further. Fossil fuels, and 
in particular coal, play an important role in meeting this 
energy demand.
In 2012, total coal production reached 3.5 billion tonnes 
(nearly 80 EJ), which was sufficient to meet domestic 
demand (CNREC, 2013a). China also produces oil and 
natural gas. In 2010, its crude oil production exceeded 
4 million barrels per day (mb/d), which is around 8 EJ. 
Natural gas production reached 96.8 billion cubic metres in 2010 (4.2 EJ) (see Figure 6).
Crude oil production has shown a steady increase between 1990 and 2012, growing at about 1.8% per year. 
Northern and western parts of China account for the 
majority of the output. Heilongjiang, Tianji and Shaanxi 
provinces contribute a half of the country’s total production (LBNL, 2012). The oil market is dominated by 
four national companies, namely China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), Sinopec, China National Off 
shore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) and Sinochem. In an 
attempt to meet the surging demand for oil products, 
China has also invested in refining capacity, pipelines 
and also port infrastructure. Total oil storage capacity 
reached 103 million barrels (under the first phase of the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or SPR). As new phases of 
the SPR are completed by 2020, combined storage capacity will further increase by a factor of 8 (IEA, 2012b).
In the same period, natural gas production has increased by 9.3% per year on average. Compared with 
two decades ago, when production was mainly used for 
meeting the demand from industry and the construction sector, today demand from the residential, commercial and transport sectors is also high (IEA, 2012b). 
China aims to increase its production from conventional 
and unconventional resources even further to improve 
gas security. The majority of production originates 
from western provinces including Xinjiang and Sichuan 
(LBNL, 2012). The same national companies which control the oil industry also dominate upstream natural gas 
production in China.
China’s coal production increased by an average of 
about 6% per year between 1990 and 2012. In the period 
between 2000 and 2006 in particular, production accelerated, reaching 10% per year growth. Inner Mongolia, 
Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces account for more than 
half of the total production (LBNL, 2012).
In addition to fossil fuel production trends, the increase 
in demand for oil products, natural gas and electricity 
over the past two decades is striking. Coal use has been 
increasing steadily since the late 1990s, averaging more 
than 6% annual growth, mainly as a result of the growing demand in the power generation and manufacturing 
industry sectors. While coal still predominates, oil and 
gas demand has been growing rapidly. Though much 
smaller in volume, the growth in oil products of 7-8% 
a year outpaced coal growth as a result of the growTable 1: Summary of biomass use in China based on different sources

 Data converted from m3 to EJ assuming a density of 450 kg/m3 for coniferous and 700 kg/m3 for non-coniferous wood, and a LHV of 17.5 GJ/t.ing demand in the transport sector. Finally, demand 
for natural gas, particularly over the past decade, has 
reached more than 20% annual growth. The State Council of China has approved a coal consumption target to 
keep it below 4 billion tonnes of coal equivalent by 2015.
Growth from China is accounting for an increasing share 
of the global demand for oil products and will continue 
to account for an even larger proportion in the short 
term due to higher car ownership. The IEA projects 
overall growth of nearly 70% between 2010 and 2030, 
which is somewhat lower than the current trends but 
still significant (IEA, 2012a). Demand for coal is expected 
to increase by 25% in the same period. Natural gas supply in comparison is projected to increase by at least a 
factor of four, higher than the growth of both oil and 
coal, though still accounting for a relatively small proportion of the total.
Demand for oil products has grown rapidly in 
the past decade, driven by a marked increase 
in car ownership
Demand for natural gas will be met partly by shale gas 
production, partly by imports by pipeline and in the 
form of liquefied natural gas (LNG), as well as from domestic sources including tight gas, coal-bed methane 
and others. China has the largest technically recoverable 
shale gas resources in the world, amounting to some 
25.1 trillion cubic metres (IEA, 2012b). The country has 
specific shale gas production targets to 2015 of 6.5 billion cubic metres per year with 990 horizontal wells 
drilled. By 2020, China aims to produce some 80 billion 
cubic metres annually, however, this target has been 
recently halved due to technical challenges (Reuters, 
2014a). Water scarcity is the main obstacle to meeting 
these targets. Although the 13.8 million cubic metres a 
year of water which would be required by the industry 
in 2014 is less than 1% of total industrial water demand, 
it may be a challenge to supply this for hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in some provinces where a substantial 
share of the water is not recoverable (Forbes, 2013).
Trade is an important component of China’s conventional energy market. China is a net importer of crude oil 
and in 2010 crude oil imports reached more than 10 EJ. 
55% of the oil consumed is imported, a share which will 
continue to rise in the future. Half of this total originated 
from Saudi Arabia (19%), Angola (17%), Iran (9%) and 
Oman (7%) (LBNL, 2012).
With increasing demand for natural gas, China also 
started importing LNG in 2006. By 2010, total imports 
had reached 9.3 billion cubic metres (equivalent to

the majority of LNG supply. Pipelines also play an important role for the natural gas trade of China. Turkmenistan is the largest supplier of natural gas, accounting for 
more than half of total imports. The most recent development is the new agreement China signed with Russia 
in May 2014, to import natural gas worth USD 400 billion 
over a period of 30 years (to deliver about 40 billion 
cubic metres of gas per year from 2018). A memorandum of understanding was signed on 9 November 2014 
to develop a second route between Russia and China 
for natural gas supply (Al-Jazeerah, 2014). China also 
continues to invest in gas storage facilities, interregional 
gas pipelines and LNG terminals as part of its strategy 
to ensure security of gas supply (IEA, 2012b).
Although China is a major producer of coal, it exports 
negligible amounts. On the other hand, its imports have 
grown rapidly, reaching 165 Mt in 2010. One third of this 
total originated from Indonesia and nearly a quarter 
from Australia (LBNL, 2012). Since 2011, China has been 
the largest importer of coal worldwide, with Japan being the second. Despite the huge scale of domestic coal 
production, there could be various reasons for the rapid 
increase in imports such as transportation bottlenecks, 
environmental and safety considerations (related to 
mining), economic factors or depleting coking coal reserves (Tu and Johnson-Reiser, 2012).
Renewable energy markets in heating and 
transport applications
Heating/cooling and motor fuels are the two thermal 
markets where renewables play a role today. A wood 
pellet market is emerging in China. Production has 
reached 0.8 Mt per year. There are about 260 manufacturers in China producing straw pellets (Xiajiao, 2012). 
Some of the largest pellet mills worldwide are located 
in China with capacities ranging between 100 and 
200 kilotonnes (kt) per year (see Table 2). Production 
is dispersed across the country with plants of small size 
ranging from 10 to 50 kt/year. Production is projected to 
grow (Vakkilainen, Kuparinen and Heinimoe, 2013; Goh 
et al., 2013). The target is to grow pellet manufacturing 
to 50 Mt per year by 2020.
China is also a large producer of charcoal. It ranks sixth 
in the world following Brazil, several African countries 
and India, with a total production of 1.7 Mt/year (Vakkilainen, Kuparinen and Heinimoe, 2013).
In 2010, pulp production in China was 20 Mt/year which 
is equivalent to 10% of total global production (including 
mechanical pulp making) (FAOSTAT, 2014). Chemical 
wood pulp production yields an organic residue called 
black liquor which is combusted in recovery boilers to 
generate energy. The total production of chemical pulp 
is about 5 Mt/year. This would yield about 100 PJ of 
black liquor (based on 22 GJ per tonne of pulp). Some 
of the largest recovery boilers are located in China; two 
of which have total production capacity of 7,000 and 
5,000 tonnes black liquor dry solids (BLDS) per day, 
equivalent to 29 PJ and 21 PJ per year, respectively. Another large-scale recovery boiler is under construction in 
Beihai with a daily capacity of 4,000 tonne BLDS.
China has had an ambitious biogas programme for half 
a century and accounts for 90% of biogas installations 
worldwide, with around 35 million units in operation in 
2010 and 5 million new units being added every year. 
Most units are small-scale installations in farms integrated to livestock production. The trend is, however, toward 
centralised and industrial production as more than half 
of China’s commercial pork originated from industrial 
scale farms in 2007 (Hallding et al., 2012).
Around 90% of all biogas was produced in small-scale 
units in 2010. Of the medium and large-scale pig farms, 
typically only 5% of the potential has been utilised (Hallding et al., 2012). Biogas production stood at 16 billion 
m3 in 2012, or around 0.25 EJ. The installation of household biogas plants has slowed, and there are about 
50 million such installations nationwide.
In keeping with this trend, current policies have begun 
to focus on large-scale applications. Distributed biogas

biogas production in China. The installations receive 
investment subsidies in the range of RMB 1300-3500. 
Also, large-scale projects receive a 25-45% investment 
subsidy from the national government as well as a 
5-25% subsidy from local governments (Van Sambeek 
et al., 2013). A variety of biogas systems can be discerned that cater to specific needs (IISD, 2014):
● The ‘three-combined’ model. Traditionally in rural 
China a domestic biogas digester is integrated 
with the toilet and livestock pen, allowing animal 
and human waste to be fed in easily.
● The ‘one-plus-three renovation’. This system is 
also known as a ‘rural biogas digester and three 
renovations’, because a rural household renovates the livestock pen, toilet and kitchen when 
constructing the biogas digester.
● The ‘three-in-one’ model in southern China. This 
system prioritises the efficient use of bio-slurry. 
Originally, the three-in-one name referred to 
‘pig-biogas-fruit’, using pig manure for biogas 
production and then bio-slurry as fertiliser for 
orange trees. This system has improved both the 
quality and quantity of fruit production.
● The ‘four-in-one’ model in northern China. A 
biogas digester, a cattle pen and a toilet are all 
installed inside a greenhouse, which is also used 
for vegetable or fruit production. In these colder 
regions, the higher temperature in a greenhouse 
enhances biogas production, animal growth and 
vegetable production.
● The ‘five-in-one’ model in northwest China. Designed for arid areas with water shortages and 
long, cold winters, this is similar to the ‘four-inone’ model, except that the greenhouse is used 
as a warm enclosure for livestock, and a rainwater 
collection cellar is included to meet the water 
needs of the household and to support biogas 
production
China has some 1,000 gasification installations, mainly 
downdraft gasifiers that provide villages with gas for 
cooking (Chen, 2011). Current developments focus on 
larger installations with 10-15 MWe capacity, mostly fluidised beds and circulating fluidised bed units.
Investment in biogas as a source of energy 
has other spin-off benefits such as an increase 
in agricultural production
Liquid biofuel use is rather small compared with other 
forms of biomass in China. The target is to produce 
5 billion litres of ethanol and 1.2 billion litres of biodiesel 
a year by 2015.
Ethanol is produced from corn, wheat and non-grain 
feedstocks. Biodiesel is largely produced from used 
cooking oil, waste animal fats and wild oilseed plants 
(Qiu et al., 2012). The emphasis is on the use of lignocellulosic crops to avoid competition with food production. In 2012, there were 159 ethanol plants recorded in 
China, of which five are licensed to produce fuel ethanol 
(see Table 3) (Qiu et al., 2012; USDA, 2013). The plant in 
Guangxi is the first cassava plant worldwide; it was built 
in 2007 (USDA, 2013). The only government-approved, 
cellulosic ethanol plant in operation is in Shandong 
province. The facility has been operating since October 
2012 and produces ethanol from corn cobs, with a total production capacity of 50 kt/year. In 2012, a sweet 
sorghum-based plant was built in Inner Mongolia with a 
total production capacity of 50 kt/y; this capacity is projected to reach 100 kt/year by 2015 (USDA, 2012;2013).

to make the tax exemption on biodiesel (5%) from 
waste cooking oil permanent (USDA, 2012).
Biofuel policies in China targets production 
from feedstocks that do not compete with 
crops for human consumption
Solar thermal and geothermal also play a role in China 
in meeting heating and cooling demand. 1,000 geothermal projects are planned with a heating/cooling area of 
50 million m2 while 100 solar thermal heating projects 
are planned with an area of 1 million m2.
In 2010, China had an installed solar thermal capacity in 
operation of 130 GWth, which increased to 152 GWth in 
2011. By 2012, installed capacity had reached 180 GWth. 
This was equivalent to 67% of the global total. The 
majority of the installed capacity by 2012 was accounted 
for by evacuated tube collectors (ETC) (168 GWth). The 
remaining 12 GWth is flat plate collectors (FPC) (CNREC, 
2013a; AEE-INTEC, 2014).
According to the “2005 Chinese Geothermal Environment Bulletin” released by the Ministry of Land and 
Resources of China, the direct utilisation of geothermal 
energy for non-electric purposes reached 10.5 GWh/
year. In 2005, installed geothermal energy capacity 
reached 10,779 MWe (Delman and Chen, 2008). The 
installed capacity of direct use geothermal plants as of 
end-2011 was 8.9 GWth which generated about 75 PJ of 
geothermal heat. The use of geothermal heat pumps 
(GHP) has grown substantially, with installed capacity 
reaching 5.2 GWth by the end of 2009 (IEA-GIA, 2013). 
According to IEA energy statistics (IEA, 2013), geothermal heat consumption in 2010 was 150 PJ/year. 80 PJ of 
this was in the residential sector, 44 PJ in commercial 
buildings and 6 PJ in industry.
Renewables make up a negligible share of total district 
heat generation (less than 1%) today. The majority of the 
demand is met by coal. Given the country’s increasing 
heating demand and technologies available, there is 
considerable potential for various forms of renewables 
to play a bigger role.
Electric vehicles
According to the Ministry of Science and Technology’s 
12th FYP for electric vehicles and the State Council’s 
Energy-Saving and New Energy Automotive Industry 
Development Plan (2012-2020) which were released 
in 2012, by 2015, 500 000 electric and plug-in hybrid 
vehicles are expected to be on the road. This will be supported with 400 000 charging piles and 2 000 charging 
or battery-switching stations. The nation aims to have 
5 million electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles on the road 
by 2020, less than 3% of all vehicles. Of global annual 
sales of between 20 and 30 million, more than 90% 
were in China. In 2010, the total number of electric two 
-wheelers reached more than 200 million (IEA-ETSAP, 
2013).
In September 2013, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Science & Technology, the Ministry of Industry & 
Information Technology and the National Development 
& Reform Commission (NDRC) issued a joint decision 
approved by the State Council on the extension of subsidies for three years from 2013 to 2015 to promote new 
energy vehicles.
The new subsidy scheme has three main attributes: 
1) it expands the scope of pilot cities to 88 across the 
country, particularly those cities where fine particle pollution has posed a serious threat to public health; 2) it 
provides differentiated subsidies for different types of 
new energy vehicles; 3) degressive rates of 10% and 20% 
will be applied to all electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid 
vehicles excepting buses for 2014 and 2015, respectively 
from the 2013 subsidy level. In addition, the new subsidy 
policy unifies the subsidies of all regions, changing the 
previous situation where subsidies varied across the 
country.
In July 2014, the State Council issued its Guidance on 
Accelerating the Use of New Energy Vehicles. The document proposes waiving a 10% purchase tax for eligible 
vehicles including electric vehicles, plug-in vehicles and 
fuel-cell vehicles from 1 September 2014 to 31 December 
2017. It is hoped that the reduced purchase cost will 
make the new energy vehicles more financially attractive. In particular, emphasis was placed on the need for 
the rapid development of charging infrastructure and 
the creation of new business models. The council also 
requested relevant authorities to present proposals for a 
fiscal stimulus policy for 2016-2020 by the end of 2014.
The output of the 628 models identified in the directory 
of recommended energy-saving and new energy vehicles of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technol-ogy reached 24 800 in 2012. This increase is equivalent 
to 94% per year, and in 2012 included 13 300 electric 
vehicles, 10 400 conventional hybrid vehicles, and more 
than 1 000 plug-in hybrid vehicles. Efforts need to be 
accelerated further to meet government targets. 
The total annual amount of new energy vehicles deployed in the 25 pilot cities (under the “10 Cities and 
1 000 Vehicles” programme) remained at 10 000. This 
is much lower than the initial goals set by some cities, 
where the total number of new energy vehicles to be 
reached was 30 000 within four years. By the end of 
2012, more than 27 000 new energy vehicles were on 
the road in the 25 cities after two years following the 
implementation of the subsidy policy. Most of these are 
public vehicles. This is more than half of the goal, and 
two main factors explain the lacklustre progress:
● First, like elsewhere at present, electric vehicles 
are relatively expensive in China. Even with 
subsidies of RMB 120 000 (about USD 17 650) 
and up to RMB 60 000 RMB (about USD 8 800) 
from central and local governments (the highest 
local subsidy exists in Shenzen), the off-the-lot 
price of a BYD E6 (a popular Chinese-made 
electric vehicle) is between RMB 170 000 and 
RMB 180 000 (USD 25 000-26 500). That is twice 
the price of a conventional internal combustion 
engine vehicle with similar configuration and 
performance. As a result, demand is still weak 
among private consumers.
● Current charging infrastructure does not meet 
recent trends in demand and more investments 
are needed if the targets are to be reached. 
By the end of 2012, the 25 pilot cities had only 
8 107 charging piles and 174 charging or batteryswitching stations. For example, the number of 
street charging piles in Shenzen reached 1 000 
in April 2013. This is much lower compared to 
the target to surpass 40 000 by 2012. By end of 
2012, 60 charging or battery switching stations 
and 1 080 charging piles were built. Similarly, this 
is also much lower than the goals of 256 stations 
and 42 000 piles by 2015. According to the information from the State Grid Corporation of China 
and China Southern Power Grid, only 4% and 
13% of the 2015 targets were achieved by 2011 
for charging piles and charging or switching stations, respectively. As a result of the shortage and 
uneven distribution of charging facilities, varying 
technology preference and interests between 
the state grid (favouring battery switching solutions) and most automobile companies (preferring charging solutions), makes it inconvenient to 
own an electric vehicle. 
China’s electric vehicle deployment have benefited from 
ambitious targets and government support in recent 
years. However, without further coordination of the 
market and policy incentives by the government, the 
industry’s future will remain unclear (WRI, 2013a).
Despite attempts to encourage people to 
buy electric vehicles, their high cost and 
poor infrastructure have hampered efforts to 
introduce them
China is also aiming for 30% of new government vehicles to be powered by alternative forms of energy 
by 2016. At least 15% of new vehicles introduced in in 
2014 in places such as Beijing and the Pearl River Delta 
will use new energy. The cabinet announced a new exemption law which will apply from 1 September 2014 
for battery electric and hybrid vehicles. The law will 
run until the end of 2017. China will offer subsidies for 
new-energy vehicles that cost below USD 29 000 and 
also request local governments to build more facilities 
(Spiegel, 2014; BNEF, 2014a).
In China, there are also electric vehicle technologies other than cars. K9 is an electric bus manufactured by BYD 
and it is powered by iron-phosphate battery developed 
by the manufacturing company. On one single charge, 
it drives 250 km under urban road conditions. On September 2010, the first BYD electric bus was on the road 
in Changsha city in Hunan province. By the end of 2012, 
more than 1 200 electric bus offers were received by 
the BYD from countries across the world (BYD, 2013). 
Production costs are expected to drop as the company 
escalates output.
Anhui Ankai Automobile Co., Ltd. is another company 
producing buses. 44 hybrid and electric buses were incorporated in the ministry’s directory of recommended 
new energy and energy-saving vehicles. The company 
is one of the leading players in the domestic new energy 
bus sector. By end of 2012, in 27 cities including Beijing, 
Shanghai, Dalian and Hefei, 1 000 new energy buses 
were on the road which were manufactured by Ankai 
(Reports, 2013).While electric cars have proved hard to introduce, by 
contrast electric two-wheelers (e-bicycles, e-scooters 
and e-motorcycles) are rapidly gaining ground. Of global 
annual sales of two- and three-wheelers between 20 and 
30 million, more than 90% were in China. In 2010, the total number of electric two -wheelers reached more than 
200 million (IEA-ETSAP, 2013). E-bicycles account for 
more than three quarters of the market. By 2018, China 
will have 355 million cumulative sales of such products. 
This means one vehicle per four persons. To some extent 
these vehicles substitute cars (GCC, 2012).
The use of urban rail transport is also growing. There 
were 1,688 kilometres (km) of operating metro railway 
in 14 cities at the end of 2011. By 2015, there will be 
3000 km of metro railway, and by 2020 6200 km are 
planned. By 2050, mainland cities will have 11700 km 
of metro railway, accounting for at least half the world’s 
total (SCMP, 2013).
In Beijing around 40% of all passengers use public 
transportation, compared with 25% in Shanghai and 
Kunming. This percentage has been rising in Beijing and 
Kunming (Yang, 2013).
An aspiration is that by 2030, 39% of all city transportation will consist of cars and 29% of buses; others include 
two-wheelers (15%), subways (4%) and walking (13%) 
(Yang, 2013). Within the car park the share of internal 
combustion engine and hybrid cars would decline to 
85%, the remainder including around 7% electric vehicles as well as other technologies (Yang, 2013).
Transmission and distribution grids
China has five state-owned power generation companies: CDC: China Datang Co.; CGC: China Guodian 
Co.; CHDC: China Huadian Co.; CHNG: China Huaneng 
Group; and, CPIC: China Power Investment Co.
China also has two state-owned grid companies, State 
Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) and China Southern 
Power Grid Corporation (CSG). SGCC accounts for approximately 80% of the total grid. CSG has the remaining 20%. These two companies cover almost all power 
transmission, distribution, and metering activities in 
China. SGCC is the largest, covering 26 provinces, whilst 
CSG covers five provinces in the south.
SGCC is the biggest utility company worldwide. 
SGCC’s core business is to build and operate power 
grids; the service area covers 26 of 31 provinces 
and oversees 88% of China’s territory. By the end of 
2013, the installed capacity of SGCC was more than 
900 GWe (4,448 TWh generation) and the maximum 
peak load reached 654  GWe. Coal power accounted 
for 73.6% of installed capacity, hydro 18%, and wind 
7% (70.2 GWe).
China’s power system consists of six regional clusters 
with weak interconnectors (The north, northeast, northwest, central, eastern and the south regions). Each cluster consists of several provinces that act as a balancing 
area. There are interconnection lines that facilitate trade 
within the regional clusters.

Based on SGCC (2013)
Note: data represents the situation end of August 2013In terms of dispatch and planning, six regional grids and 
the provinces which belong to them have considerable 
autonomy. This creates opportunities for local influence 
on grid operation although, under this system, transmission projects may be underutilised.
Thermal power plants are assigned a fixed number 
of full load hours every year and the volume of interprovincial trading is decided a year ahead. Day-ahead 
dispatching takes these two rules into account. There 
are fiscal incentives to maximize local production. The 
variability of wind power, notably, interferes with the allocation of full load hours and trading practices.
Peak loading and transmission constraints make it hard 
to transport power into high consumption areas. The 
current transmission system was designed to accommodate a base load and slowly varying output of coal 
power. Transmission lines in China reach an annual peak 
loading on average of 50% of capacity. However, this 
average can be misleading because many lines are at 
full capacity while others are operating sometimes with 
nearly no capacity (DB, 2012).
Sustained electricity growth requires both long-distance 
and higher capacity transmission. This is particularly 
important for China where resource potential is widely 
distributed and far from demand centres. As a result of 
concerns over air pollution, railway congestion, and to 
be able to meet the increasing growth of electricity demand, north and western parts of China are becoming 
electricity production centres.
The China Electricity Council, in its 2014 projections and 
recommendations, focused on the northeast’s excess 
capacity problem, recommending that the central government “strictly control” new coal and wind construction in the region. It projected a smaller (though still 
substantial) increase in coal-fired capacity nationwide 
of 30 GWe. CEC’s other projections for new installations

Investment in long-distance and higher 
capacity transmission networks is essential 
for sustained electricity growth in China
With the air pollution plan, 12 west-east “air pollution 
control transmission corridors” are being planned. These 
will reduce coal-fired electricity generation in eastern 
parts of China where population is high. In the southern lines, hydro will be primarily connected whereas 
in the northern lines wind and coal will be bundled as 
they originate in areas of development of both energy 
sources.
A synchronised UHV alternating current (UHV-AC) grid 
could lead to more centralised control of the national 
power system. In comparison, an asynchronous UHV 
direct current (UHV-DC) grid would not necessarily disturb the current setup, and it is seen as a hedge against 
greater monopolisation (Davidson, 2014).
UHV-AC is planned to connect north and central grids 
(Huainan-Shanghai). UHV-DC is planned to connect the 
power generation in the west with centres of demand 
in the east (Hami-Zhengzhou). Total UHV transmission 
grid capacity is projected to increase to 200 GWe by 
2020 (10-15% of total generation capacity). Meanwhile, a 
UHV-AC synchronous grid is planned for northern, central and southern areas. The UHV grid lines in China use 
900 kV, the highest rating in the world. The grid will give 
shape to a system of three vertical and three horizontal 
axes. The vertical, north-south axis will connect the biggest coal and wind production areas of Inner Mongolia, 
Shanxi and Shaanxi to the north central and eastern 
parts of the country.
An ultra-high transmission corridor to increase the integration of renewable energy resources is outlined in 
China’s 12th FYP. The 2090-km-long 800 kV UHV-DC 
Jinping-Sunan transmission line is the second largest 
in the world, allowing 7.2 GWe to be transmitted, and is 
owned by SGCC. The project cost USD 3.5 billion, and 
transports hydroelectricity from power stations along 
the Yalong river in Sichuan province to the industrialised 
coastal area of Jiangsu. This power line was built by ABB 
together with CEPRI and other Chinese partners. And 
even higher capacities are being developed. The third 
largest UHVDC transmission network in the world is also 
in China, comprising the 1980-km-long line that connects the Xiangjiaba hydroelectricity plant to industrial 
users around Shanghai with a rated capacity of 6.4 GWe. 
It was the first such commercial operation in the world, 
and completed 30 months ahead of schedule. There are 
also projects to integrate these HVDC lines into a HVAC 
grid based on technology by CEPRI.
The latest development suggests that SGCC will spend 
an additional USD 162.8 billion on eight UHV transmission lines to be built before 2021, both for renewables 
and coal-fired power stations located further away from 
the big cities. Another estimate states that by 2020, 
China would be spending about USD 107 billion in UHV 
transmission lines and related capacity. Investment in 
end-points of the transmission lines account for around 
half of the total investments, for both AC and DC, and 
Box 1: Rural grids and mini-grids
Since the 1950s, China has pursued the development of small hydroelectricity plants, firstly in terms of standalone projects and later those connected to the national grid as it expanded. In 2002, there were 42,000 small 
hydroelectricity plants with a total capacity of 28 GWe providing distributed energy. Today, China has roughly 
60,000 diesel and hydro mini-grid systems, most of which have been connected to the centralized grid. Between 2003 and 2005, China’s Township Electrification Programme constructed 721 solar PV and PV/wind 
hybrid systems (20 MWe) along with 146 small hydro stations (264 MWe) to provide electricity to 1.3 million 
people (LBNL, 2013). A Village Electrification Programme, implemented between 2005 and 2010, connected 
another 3.5 million people to renewable sources of energy. By the end of 2015, China aims to address the 
challenge of providing power to another 2.73 million people without electricity, including 1.54 million by grid 
extension and 1.19 million by independent solar PV power supply utilisation. By the end of 2008, there were 
more than 400,000 off-grid solar home systems in China (IRENA, forthcoming).include transformers, reactive power control devices, 
circuit breakers, isolation switches, surge arrestors and 
other related subsystems. The remaining half consists of 
the cables, insulators and towers (DB, 2012).
Renewables such as pumped hydro can play 
a key role in balancing output, although 
there is no scope for arbitrage unless price 
flexibility is introduced
In addition to these considerable developments in grid 
expansion, technologies for accommodating the increasing share of variable renewables will gain further 
importance. Pumped hydro can play an important role 
in balancing variable renewables. However, in the current system there is no possibility for arbitrage as electricity prices are set by the state and there is no special 
price for electricity from pumped hydro.
China has over 20 GWe of pumped hydro installed and 
more than 9 GWe is under construction (see Table 5). 
Another 120-130 GWe of pumped hydro projects are in 
the planning stage; the target for 2030 is more than 
100 GWe (Perera, 2014). Pumped hydro can help to 
stabilise power generation from variable renewables. 
Total pumped hydro capacity is more or less equally 
distributed across China’s eastern, southern, northern 
and central provinces (Perera, 2014).
The development of the smart grid is also very important to achieve the aims of the 12th FYP, which mandates 
that 15% of the primary energy consumption has to be 
provided by non-fossil fuels in order to reduce carbon 
emissions. The supply and demand of power through 
the national distribution network are managed more 
effectively with smart grids. For doing so, smart grids 
introduce high-tech communications to the system. 
They also accommodate renewable power sources such 
as solar and wind more efficiently.
For the future, China has developed a smart grid plan 
which will be gradually deployed in three phases; construction investment entered a large-scale phase in 
2012. Since 2009, some 298 demonstration projects 
have been set up across China (SGCC, 2014). As of 2011, 
eight substations adapted to smart gird technology had 
been constructed in regions including Beijing, Shanghai 
and Chongqin. Also in 2011, the State Grid Company 
deployed more than 50 million smart meters (ESTELA, 
2011).

Source: Based on Perera (2014)It is worth noting that China’s smart grid development is 
different from others in the West. In the USA and the EU, 
for example, the well-established power systems have 
little or flat future demand for electricity and thereby 
the focus of smart grid development is on distribution networks. By comparison, in China the focus is on 
backbone transmission networks due to the continued 
growth of electricity demand and the mismatch of generators and load centres.
Regarding smart grids for renewables, there are a number of activities that have been promoted. One of the 
key applications (in terms of investment streams) has 
been the deployment of smart meters. China has just 
under 250 million smart meters installed (Worldwatch, 
2014). Another area that has been promoted is wind 
forecasting to support renewable energy grid integration. There are plans to provide wind forecast data 
with high spatial and time resolutions (9 km grid, every 
5 minutes).
China has more than 250 million smart meters 
installed, twice as many as the total number 
of households in the USA
There are also a large number of demonstration projects on smart grid development for renewable energy 
integration. For example, the Zhangbei Demonstration 
Project includes 100 MWe of wind, 40 MWe of PV, and 
14  MWe of storage combined with smart substations, 
intelligent control systems, and forecasting methods.

2030
China’s TFEC is projected to increase from 57 EJ in 2010 
to 92 EJ in 2030 (3,130 Mtce). This is an increase of 
60% in 20 years. Total fossil fuel demand is expected to 
increase at a slower rate of 40%. Much of the shortfall 
is accounted for by a fourfold increase in natural gas 
demand over the same period. Demand for coal would 
only increase by 13%.
In the Reference Case, total power generation is expected to more than double (by at least 5 000 TWh) from 
4 200 TWh/year in 2010 to approximately 9 300 TWh/
year by 2030 (Figure 9). Renewable power generation is 
projected to increase from about 800 TWh to more than 
2 600 TWh. By 2030, hydroelectricity generation will 
total 1 600 TWh followed by wind with 650 TWh, solar 
PV and CSP 200 TWh and finally biomass with 190 TWh. 
Hydroelectricity includes an additional 200 TWh that 
is related to the increased use of electricity-based 
technologies in end-use sectors sourcing demand from 
This section explains the Reference Case renewable energy trends in China between 2010 and 2030.
The REmap analysis begins with an assessment of the 
uptake of renewable energy technology options between 2010 and 2030 based on current policies. IEA 
(2012a) and CNREC estimates are used to develop the 
Reference Case for the REmap analysis of China. To put 
this Reference Case in perspective, this section begins 
with a brief timeline of China’s primary energy demand 
developments since 1990 (see Figure 8).
The exponential growth in total primary energy supply 
between 1990 and 2010 will slow down in the following 
two decades to 2030. Coal consumption will flatten or 
increase only slightly with most consumption being in 
natural gas, followed by oil and nuclear power. Growth 
in other renewables (solar, wind), bioenergy and hydro 
will follow.

Total renewable energy demand in end-use sectors 
(excluding renewable electricity and district heat) will 
see an increase from about 5 EJ/year to 7 EJ/year 
(Figure  10). This includes developments in the traditional use of biomass where its demand decreases 
from 3 400 PJ/year in 2010 to 1 000 PJ/year. As a result 
of this decrease, total bioenergy demand for heating 
decreases from 4 000 PJ to around 3 200 PJ per year. 
Growth is projected in all other resources as well. Solar

entire period, from 860 PJ to 2 700 PJ per year. All this 
growth is accounted for by the building sector. Geothermal heat doubles from 150 PJ to 300 PJ, but its contribution to the total renewable energy share consumption 
still remains small.
Modern forms of solid biomass use increase by four 
times, from 500 PJ per year to 2,200 PJ/year. The highest rate of growth is projected for the manufacturing 
industry sector, from a total use of 100 PJ/year in the 
pulp and paper sector alone to 700 PJ/year including 
its other sub-sectors. Solid biomass in the form of briquettes and pellets triples by 2030 compared to with 
2010 levels to 1,500 PJ/year. Liquid biofuel and biogas 
use increases to 2 EJ in 2030.
Further electrification of the transport 
industry will help increase the share of 
renewable energy used by the sector
Liquid biofuels use increases from a total of 2.5 Mt to 
30 Mt per year in 2030, or from about 2 billion litres to 
a total of about 23 billion litres in 2030. This is a continuation of the trends between 2010 and 2020 biofuel 
targets of 12 Mt per year (10 Mt bioethanol and 2 Mt biodiesel) to 2030. The number of electric vehicles (battery 
and plug-in hybrid) is projected to increase from about 
30,000 to nearly 17 million. This represents a 3% share of 
the total vehicle stock. The number of electric two- and 
three-wheelers is projected to double to 400 million.
Further electrification is key for the transport sector 
of China. The renewable energy share of 3.5% in 2030 
Reference Case with liquid biofuels only, would increase 
to 5.2% when electricity use for transportation and the 
related share of renewable electricity is accounted for.
Modern renewable energy as a percentage of TFEC will 
increase from 7.1% in 2010 to 15.8% by 2030 (excluding 
traditional use of biomass) (Figure 11). The increase in the 
Reference Case renewable energy share will be driven 
mostly by an increase of renewable power generation 
from 19% in 2010 to 29% in 2030. The transport sector 
will see an increase of renewable energy from 1% to 
4% by 2030, in the form of biofuels but also partly 
electrification. The share of modern renewable energy 
use in the industry sector will increase from 4.9% to 11.4% 
and in the buildings sector from 15.5% to 35% by 2030, 
both largely driven by biomass. The rapid growth of 
renewables in the power sector is balanced by the trends 
in the end-use sectors. The renewable energy share of 
district heat generation remains the same across the 
entire period.

To keep the balance between supply and fast-increasing 
demand while improving security of supply presents a 
major challenge which it is only possible to overcome 
with a whole range of different policies. These are discussed later in this report in Sections 8 and 9.
5.1 Airborne Pollution Prevention 
and Control Action Plan
Air pollution and its effects on health and the economy 
are a serious concern for China. According to some estimates, the total number of mortalities from ambient 
air pollution (particulate matter and ozone pollution) 
reached approximately 1.2 million in 2010. China has succeeded in reducing PM levels substantially and slowing 
the increase in mortalities, but further reductions remain 
a challenge (OECD, 2014). PM concentration varies 
across the country; according to 2005 statistics cities 
in the north have much higher levels (85-160 µg/m3) 
compared with urban areas in the south (47-125 µg/m3). 
Based on the analysis of trends between 1975 and 2005, 
Matus et al. (2012) estimate that ozone and PM concentrations resulted in a USD 16-69 billion loss of consumption and USD 22-112 billion loss of welfare in China’s 
economy. Besides the effects on human health, research 
shows that air pollution has also significant impacts on 
agricultural production. A global risk assessment shows 
that local crop loss from sulphur dioxide emissions could 
be an important issue for countries such as China and 
India (Marshall, Ashmore and Hinchcliffe, 1997).
In response to these concerns, China’s State Council 
released its Action Plan for Air Pollution Prevention 
and Control on 12 September 2013. The plan focuses on 
three key regions, namely the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area 
(Jing-Jin-Ji), the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River 
Delta, and sets targets for the next five years.
The Chinese government recognises that tackling the air 
pollution crisis will require significant reductions in coal 
consumption. For the first time, its plans introduce coal 
consumption caps for provinces. Furthermore, many 
provinces have been committed since 2013 to reversing 
the rapid growth in coal use and cutting their overall 
Key points
● Renewable energy policy in China has been 
largely driven by rapidly rising energy demand, 
reflecting economic growth and related supplysecurity concerns at a national level.
● Renewables will also play a key role in raising the 
use of non-coal and non-fossil-fuel sources as a 
proportion of total energy demand, according to 
the Action Plan for Air Pollution Prevention and 
Control.
● At a provincial level, renewable energy targets 
and the related Renewable Energy Law, which 
consists of a feed-in-tariff and mandatory grid 
connection, are key instruments to help increase 
the use of renewable sources for the power sector.
● Specific support programmes for the expansion 
of the domestic renewable industry – especially 
wind and solar PV – focus on research and development (R&D) as well as an increase in manufacturing capacity.
● Mandatory market shares – also known as “renewable portfolio standards” – for utility and grid 
operators are under discussion, with the possibility of a programme being implemented by 2015.
● Future caps on coal consumption for the whole 
of China, as well as for specific provinces, may 
also help the uptake of renewable energy options.
● Grid expansion plans are being implemented, 
and a smart grid programme is under development. However, there is no concerted power-grid 
policy for renewable energy yet.
● Renewable heating policy specifically focuses on 
solar water heating, while transport sector policy 
is mostly concentrated on direct subsidies for 
electric vehicles.
China’s energy demand has grown significantly over the 
past decade due to rapid economic development. This 
section starts with an overview of one of the main drivers in China’s renewable energy policy – air pollution, 
and it continues by providing further insight to the policies across all sectors – power, buildings and transport 
– but puts a clear focus on the renewable power sector. coal consumption in just four years. No other major 
coal-consuming country has ever implemented such 
ambitious targets. If achieved, the measures will not 
only fundamentally shift the coal consumption trajectory of the world’s largest coal consumer, but also significantly re-shape the global CO2 emission landscape.
Tackling China’s air pollution crisis will require 
significant reductions in coal consumption. 
Shandong province alone burns more coal 
than Germany and Japan combined
A large share of China’s total coal consumption is 
covered by the targets. Shandong is the largest coal 
consumer among Chinese provinces and Hebei ranks 
fourth. Shaanxi is among the ten provinces that consume the most coal. Another two key economic regions 
– the Yangtze River Delta, comprising Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, with 11% of national coal consumption, and the Pearl River Delta – are aiming for absolute 
reductions in coal use by the end of 2017.
Liaoning and Jilin will also have to limit growth in their 
coal consumption to less than 2% per year by 2017. Until 
recently, with the exception of Beijing, all provinces 
which were covered by the plan have seen coal consumption grow rapidly.
The plan aims to reduce the share of coal in total energy consumption to 65% by 2017, with the share of 
non-fossil energy reaching 13%. Natural gas will be a 
key substitute for coal in the generation of power and 
heat. Twelve provinces which account for 44% of China’s 
total consumption committed to implement measure to 
control coal consumption. Six provinces have included 
absolute targets in their plans, with a 50% reduction 
targeted in Beijing, 13% in Hebei, 19% in Tianjin, 5% in 
Shandong, 21% in Chongqing and 13% in Shaanxi by the 
end of 2017. Beijing is also planning to ban the use of 
coal by 2020 (Huffington Post, 2014).
While the current air pollution plan runs until 2017, 
further action could be taken in a review scheduled for 
2015, as well as the upcoming FYP for the years 2016-
Box 2: Implications of changes in coal-based power production on water demand
Changes in coal use could have considerable implications for China’s water resources. Today, 85% of the 
country’s total power generation capacity is located in water-scarce regions and 15% of this capacity relies 
on water-intensive technologies. Northern China in particular is suffering from high demand for water from 
the coal supply sector. Currently, more than half of China’s industrial water usage is in coal-related sectors, 
including mining, preparation, power generation, coke production and coal-to-chemical factories. Coal mining and coal power generation sectors in the north accounted for 15% of China’s total freshwater withdrawals 
(98 billion m3) in 2010 (SA, 2013). National water consumption is projected to increase from 599 billion m3 to 
630 billion m3 by 2020. By then, the coal sector will be responsible for 27% of withdrawals, with an estimated 
34 billion m3 of water per year used by coal-fired power plants alone.
The coal challenge is exacerbated by the fact that almost all of the collieries are in the northwest, which is 
also one of the country’s driest regions. Coal expansion plans imply that the equivalent of a quarter of the 
water in the Yellow River would be needed (ca. 10 billion m3/year). This water is not available. Of the planned 
coal power expansion plans, half are located in high or extremely high water-stressed regions (WRI, 2013b).
Various plans such as water diversion from the south to the north, seawater desalination, east-west pipelines 
and dry cooling for coal plants (substituting water cooling) are being considered. The South-to-North Water 
Diversion Project, planned for completion in 2050, will eventually divert 44.8 billion m3/year to the north. The 
Hami and Tianshan power plants will have air cooling systems by the end of 2014, as will another plant next 
year in Junzheng Wuhai (PE, 2013). However, dry cooling reduces the efficiency of coal power plants, raising their generation costs. Moreover the quantities involved are too small to make a significant difference to 
China’s overall water consumption.2020. Coal caps could be introduced to a number of 
other key provinces, which would also ensure that polluting industries do not simply relocate to areas without 
coal reduction policies. In addition to these twelve provinces, 17 others announced intentions to cap or reduce 
coal use. 
The change of direction is showing results. New capacity additions in power generation have begun to follow a 
new trajectory, with coal accounting for only 26% of new 
investments as of 2012, while non-fossil sources – hydro, 
wind, nuclear – made up 72%. In 2012, China added 
12 TWh of coal, 26 TWh of wind, and 196 TWh of hydro.
This trend is encouraging, but major effects on air pollution levels remain to be seen. Out of the 161 cities 
monitored in the first half of 2014, only nine of them 
meet China’s new air quality standards. One of those 
cities which did not meet the targets was Beijing, due to 
its high levels of PM2.5 and other pollutants (NY, 2014). In 
February 2014, the concentration of PM2.5 had reached 
505 micrograms per cubic metre, which is sufficient to 
penetrate into the lungs and the bloodstream (Guardian, 2014).
5.2 Renewable energy policy of 
China
The development of new renewable energy policies can 
be traced back to 2004, when China announced plans 
to develop a renewable energy law and to establish a 
renewable energy development fund16. At the outset, 
‘small-hydro’ and small-scale solar PV were identified 
as key areas for the encouragement of decentralised 
projects.
The establishment of the CNREC – developed in close 
cooperation with Denmark – was another national milestone. This institution assists China’s energy authorities 
in renewable energy policy research, industrial management and coordination. China’s 12th FYP, which was 
launched in 2010, was the first time renewables were 
identified as an emerging strategic industry.
16 At the “Renewables 2004” conference in Bonn, Germany in June 
2004, a follow-up to the 2002 World Summit for Sustainable Development (WSSD).
The main components of Chinas renewable energy 
policy are as follows (Zhang et al., 2013):
● Mandatory market share for renewables by sector and technology
● Tariff based support mechanisms
● Government financial support for renewable energy projects
Each component is discussed below in more detail.
Mandatory market share (MMS)
The National Development & Reform Commission 
(NDRC) introduced mandatory market share (MMS, or 
“renewable portfolio standards” as they are called in the 
United States) in 2007 in China, linked to the country’s 
mid-term (2007-2010) and long-term (until 2020) development plans for renewable energy. The NDRC is a 
ministry in the central government that is responsible 
for planning the economic development of the country, 
and it has been assigned the responsibility for energy 
and climate change (Lo et al., 2014).
In regions served by centralised power grids, the share 
of power generation form non-hydro renewable sources 
should reach 1% of the total by 2010 and 3% by 2020 according to the plan. Furthermore, power producers with 
a capacity larger than 5 GWe must increase its actual 
ownership of power capacity from non-hydro renewable energy sources to 3% by 2010 and 8% by 2020 
(NPC, 2013; Zhang et al., 2013).
Many aspects of the policy have yet to be put into practice, according to Lo et al. (2014). As of 2010, none of the 
six largest generators had met the 3% renewable energy 
target, partly due to the lack of monitoring and compliance requirements. Furthermore, the focus of MMS is 
on installed capacity rather than generation. Therefore, 
there was no incentive for grid companies to act.
To address these problems, the NDRC began to develop 
an improvement plan in 2011. A four-step programme 
was developed which introduced changes and additional details to improve the renewable portfolio standard 
(Lo et al., 2014). These included the following:
Individual targets would be assigned to generators and 
grid companies, depending on their circumstances and Box 3: Renewable energy targets in China
China’s 12th FYP identified renewables as an emerging strategic industry and set overall targets for renewables. 
Table 9 below lists the different sectorial and/or technology targets for 2015 and 2020.
The Chinese government also released targets for renewable energy use under the current 12th FYP. The overall goal is for total modern renewable energy consumption to reach 14 EJ (478 Mtce), representing 9.5% or 
more of the overall energy consumption mix by the end of 2015 (this excludes the traditional use of biomass) 
(CNREC, 2012). In January 2012, as part of its 12th FYP, China published a report on greenhouse emissions 
control, which establishes goals of reducing carbon intensity by 17% by 2015, compared with 2010 levels, and 
raising energy use intensity by 16%, relative to GDP.
According to this plan China will meet 11.4% of its primary energy requirements from non-fossil sources by 
2015. At the same time coal use is projected to decline, from 67% to 60% by 2020.
China’s total installed power generation capacity is expected to nearly double from 968 GWe in 2010 to 1,786 
GWe by 2020. The installed capacity of renewable energy will reach at least 600 GWe by 2020, from 250 GWe
in 2010.
In its 12th FYP, finalised in August 2012, China committed about USD 290 billion to clean energy investments. 
Its goal is to produce 20% of the nation’s electricity from renewable sources by 2015. Total installed hydroelectricity generation capacity is targeted to reach 290 GWe, while wind power will total 100 GWe. Solar power 
capacity will total 21 GWe in 2015.
In October 2012, China’s State Council released its Energy Policy white paper, updating the previous targets 
that had been outlined in its five-year plan. The new document extended these targets considerably. China 
now determined that, by 2015, no less than 30% of its electric power capacity would be based on non-fossil 
fuel sources – mainly hydro, wind and some solar, as well as nuclear. Installed total wind power generation 
capacity had already reached 100 GWe by the end of 2013, while solar PV had reached 35 GWe.
capacities, with the aim of making the RPS more practical as well as clarifying the companies’ obligations
● Significantly increased renewable energy targets 
would be set for grid companies to provide more 
incentives to purchase renewable electricity. For 
example, the State Grid, China’s largest grid company, is expected to achieve a 4.8% non-hydro 
renewable energy share by 2015 (The previous 
target was 3% by 2020),
● The National Energy Administration (NEA) was 
given the responsibility of monitoring compliance 
on a monthly basis. Renewable energy certificates 
would be used to track the fulfilment of targets, 
but the certificates had not been made tradable
● The failure to meet targets negatively impacts on 
managers’ performance evaluations. All generators and grid companies regulated by the RPS 
are state-owned enterprises, and their managers 
are evaluated annually by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission 
(SASAC).
This draft was released in May 2012 for public consultation (Lo et al., 2014). State-owned enterprises have so 
far resisted these new requirements, which were still 
under debate in mid-2014. The MMS is expected to be 
implemented by the end of 2014 or in 2015.
Tariff based support mechanisms for power 
generation from renewable energy sources
Since the Renewable Energy Law came into force on 
January 2006, renewables have been guaranteed grid connection in China. The law was amended in 2009 
(IRENA, 2013; NPC, 2013).
According to this law, purchase price of renewable electricity generation is determined by the NDRC. The law 
provides the legal basis of the support to renewable energy based electricity generation, regulations for implementation and administrative practices that determine 
the electricity pricing. There are a number of obligations 
for power grid companies when entering into interconnection agreements with certain projects. They need to 
provide grid-connection services and related technical 
support. In addition they need to purchase and dispatch 
the entire amount of electricity generated from renewable energy projects (IRENA, 2013; Zhang et al., 2013).
There is a free connection service provided by the SGCC 
for distributed solar PV electricity producers which are 
located close to consumers and for those with installed 
capacity of less than 6 MWe from 1 November 2012 onwards. In addition, in February 2013, SGCC expanded 
its free connection services to all types of distributed 
electricity sources (Zhang et al., 2013).
Two main methods have been adopted— competitive tendering (government-guided pricing; an aucTable 9: Renewable energy targets overview

Sources: Based on CNREC (2012); Campbell (2014)tion mechanism) and FiTs (government-fixed pricing) 
(NDRC, 2006; NPC, 2013; The World Bank, 2014). During 
the period from 2006 to July 2009, the grid-connected 
power price of wind power projects was determined by 
a government-guided price set in accordance with the 
price selected through a public request for tenders.
Under the concession programme (i.e., auctions), investors and developers are selected for renewable 
energy projects such as large wind farms or solar plants 
through a competitive bidding process; the government 
is committed to coordinating connection to the power 
grid and purchasing all the electricity generated by the 
concession projects. Between 2003 and 2007, the NDRC 
initiated five rounds of concession bids for wind power 
projects (Cozzi, 2012). Auctions were also implemented 
for solar PV, offshore wind and CSP. Price was the determinant factor in deciding successful bidders (IRENA, 
2013; Zhang et al., 2013).
These auctions were basis for setting the level for the 
FiT as the government was able to gather cost information from various renewable energy projects (Wang, 
Barosso and Elizondo, 2014). A categorised on-grid 
price setting for each individual source of renewable 
energy generation connected to the grid has been implemented to determine the FiT from 2005 onwards. To 
set the price the following factors are taken into account 
(Zhang et al., 2013):
● Techno-economic performance of different renewable energy technologies
● Geographic location
● Availability of renewable energy resources
● The FiT rates evolved over time and have been 
continuously reduced according to the cost of 
development (see Table 10 for the rates as of 
July 2014).
Government financial support for renewable 
energy projects
The Chinese government also supports renewable energy projects by providing financial subsidies. In 2009

6 Tibet autonomous region benchmark price will be forthcoming.the Ministry of Finance (MOF) initiated two national 
solar PV subsidy programmes to support and expand 
the domestic solar industry:
● An up-front subsidy for building-integrated PV 
(BIPV) systems and a subsidy of 50% of the bidding price for the supply of critical components 
are provided (Zhang et al., 2013). Financial support has decreased substantially since the programme’s inception, reflecting the declining cost 
of photovoltaic energy. By 2012, the rate had fallen 
to 9 RMB/W for BIPV (compared with 20 RMB/W 
in 2009) and 7.5 RMB/W for rooftop systems 
(from 15 RMB/W in 2009) (Lo et al., 2014).
● The Golden Sun Demonstration Programme provides direct subsidies for on- and off-grid PV 
systems: equivalent to 50% of the total cost for 
on-grid systems and 70% for off-grid systems 
in rural areas. In 2012, on-grid systems received 
RMB 5.5/W, while off-grid systems received 
RMB 7.0/W (Lo et al., 2014).
5.3 Transport sector related 
policies
There are four key policy mechanisms related to passenger cars which aim to reduce energy demand and 
increase the share of renewable energy use:
● Fuel economy standards and labelling
● Vehicle and fuel taxation
● Subsidies for energy-efficient and electric vehicles
Box 4: Distributed solar PV in China and new policy developments
Distributed solar PV in China deserves particular attention. It is important for the country because it is an 
emerging industry and provides opportunities for new local jobs as well as the chance for users to become 
producers. In addition, distributed solar PV offers cost benefits compared with utility-scale plants that need 
to be connected to the grid. Particularly because of these benefits, the government has been encouraging 
investments since late 2013. 
Due to the slow uptake of the technology, it had not been expected that production would reach the government’s 8 GWe target. But by the end of 2013, the total installed distributed solar PV capacity had reached 
4 GWe and, in the first quarter of 2014, more than 3 GWe capacity was commissioned. This creates hopes that 
the 8 GWe target might be achieved in 2014. 
In early September 2014, the NEA made its policy updates public which include a range of options (BNEF, 
2014b, EnergyTrend, 2014). The policy offers the option to choose between a premium subsidy and a local FiT 
for solar PV that is connected to a transmission grid. Furthermore, the challenges related to grid connection 
and payments are also addressed.
The policy update also addresses a number of more specific areas. For example, local governments are encouraged to include distributed solar PV in their planning and to provide guidance and support to both investor and owners, in particular in development zones, on large company rooftops, on public infrastructure and 
in areas previously not considered for distributed solar PV. Investments in projects outside the current system 
boundaries for distributed solar PV are also accounted for, such as plants on abandoned land, greenhouses, 
lakes or ponds.
While all these policy updates are very encouraging, many barriers remain to the growth of a distributed 
solar PV market for China. These include the need to improve the quality of equipment available, a lack of 
standards, lack of financing and risks that involve roof ownership as well as technical issues relating to infrastructure.● Incentives for biodiesel use
The State Council considers electric vehicles to be key to 
transforming the transport sector. There are three types 
of subsidies for energy-efficient and electric vehicles 
(Lo et al., 2014):
● Energy-efficient automobiles with fuel consumption of between 4.8 litres per 100 km to 6.9 litres 
per 100 km, depending on weight, are supported 
with 3,000 RMB,
● Electric vehicles:
— Support ranges from 3,000 RMB to a maximum of 50,000 RMB depending on battery 
capacity and type of vehicle,
— Plug-in hybrid vehicles (50,000 RMB),
— Pure electric vehicles (60,000 RMB)
● Hybrid and electric public vehicles, including buses, taxis, official vehicles and municipal service 
vehicles (e.g., garbage trucks and mail trucks), 
are subsidised based on the length and type of 
vehicle, its fuel-saving potential, and the ratio of 
electric motor and battery type
China is also aiming for 30% of new government vehicles to be powered by alternative energy by 2016. In 
addition to subsidies, there were a number of license 
plate-based policies (e.g., odd-even, end-number) in 
Beijing to reduce car use. In Beijing there is also a policy 
to increase the purchase of small passenger cars with 
fewer than five seats. Another policy in the city restricts 
driving by one day a week to reduce car use by 20% 
during week days (Wang et al., 2013).
While in principle the government is keen to encourage 
the use of biofuels, there are a number of major constraints. A variety of feedstocks can be used for ethanol 
production, including cassava, sugar cane or sweet 
sorghum. However, land availability is an important issue for China in view of the demand for food. Rising 
domestic grain prices have also led to ambitious plans 
for transportation biofuel production based on food 
crops being abandoned.
Instead, attention has focused on advanced biofuels 
and the main policy for biofuel production in China is 
to avoid competition with crops for human consumption. Since 2008, the government has been tightening 
controls on the grain processing sector to lower financial 
support for grain-based ethanol production. By 2015, a 
value added tax rebate will also be removed and a 5% 
tax for grain-based ethanol production will be applied. 
There are nationwide targets to increase the consumption of bioethanol and biodiesel. Each province or city 
has the authority to implement its own policies. With 
regard to bioethanol, there are limited incentives for 
grain-based production and subsidies have been cut. In 
the case of biodiesel, there are no national or provincial 
mandates given the small scale of production (USDA, 
2013). It should also be noted that, unlike the European 
car market, in China only trucks use diesel engines. Thus 
the feedstock for biofuels for domestic consumption in 
China will differ from other countries.
The future of the biofuel sector is still 
under discussion – industry development is 
therefore insecure
5.4 Solar water heating policy for 
buildings
China has installed the most solar water heaters in the 
world, accounting for nearly two-thirds of global capacity. The adoption of solar thermal heating has accelerated without government support; between 2000 and 
2012 solar water heater installation increased almost 
tenfold from 26 million m2 to more than 250 million m2. 
In 2009, the MOF started a support programme to subsidise solar thermal use for rural consumers in China. 
This programme provided an allowance equivalent to 
13% of the product price, with a ceiling of RMB 5,000 
per unit for solar water heaters. In June 2012 a new 
subsidy programme was initiated by the MOF for urban 
consumers offering up to 550 RMB per installation (Lo 
et al., 2014).
5.5 Industrial policies for renewable 
energy
There are important socio-economic benefits of renewable energy deployment such as increased income, 
industrial development and job creation (IRENA, 2014e). 
Hence in addition to policies that focus on renewable 
energy use, China uses specific supply-side tools to support the development of a national renewable energy industry. One of them is financial support for research 
and development (R&D). The 11th FYP classified the 
development of energy technologies as a top priority 
and provides short-term targets and goals for China’s 
R&D and innovation activities as well as listing energy 
technologies as a key area (Zhang et al., 2013). Three key 
clean technologies are highlighted:
2–3 MWe wind turbine commercialisation: Among various publicly funded programmes, the “863” and “973” 
programmes were the two most important, providing 
substantial direct funding
● Domestic wind industry across the entire value 
chain: The Ministry of Finance also established a 
special fund to support enterprises in their R&D. 
These enterprises are either controlled domestically or 100% owned and produce wind power 
machines and equipment
● Solar PV: Several R&D projects have been government-financed, such as polysilicon production. This enabled bodies such as the stateowned Semiconductor Research Institution to 
transfer knowledge from its R&D to other manufacturers in China
Another key area for financial support is renewable 
energy equipment manufacturing. In order to achieve 
self-sufficiency in the supply of such equipment, China 
offers import tax exemptions for complete sets of 
Box 5: China´s “push & pull” strategy to expand the renewable energy industry
China has used a unique “push & pull” strategy for the expansion of renewable energy over the past decade. 
The first step occurred in 2006 with the creation of a market for renewable generation based on a FiT programme that drew heavily on the experience of other such schemes elsewhere, particularly in Germany. As 
a result, a renewable electricity market was developed that created bankable project developments for new 
wind turbines.
At the same time, China has actively encouraged the establishment of a local wind industry and a solar PV 
industry. These “push” mechanisms have included R&D programmes, financial support for renewable energy 
technologies and local content requirements which have driven a significant expansion of the domestic 
manufacturing base.

Additionally, a strong export strategy – especially for solar photovoltaic technologies – was established to 
boost demand for China´s renewable energy manufactured products. The result has been a significant reduction in the cost of solar PV modules and a market in China that installed 13 GWe of new solar PV in 2013.
Expanding the annual output of renewable energy manufacturers in turn achieves economies of scale which 
reduce generation costs and lead to cost-competitiveness with conventional forms of power generation. 
Increased market competitiveness also leads to a decrease in required FiTs. The interaction of lower equipment costs and the resulting lower generation costs provides benefits for all involved. These types of positive 
feedback loops are possible especially in larger economies.foreign-made equipment, as well as import tax exemptions for foreign-made parts which are necessary for the 
development of key equipment for domestic enterprises 
(Zhang et al., 2013).
China is encouraging local renewable 
equipment manufacturers through a range 
of tax exemptions as well as direct financial 
support
State-owned banks and local governments have also 
provided strong financial support for “strategic emerging industries,” which include the renewable manufacturing industry. The China Development Bank (CDB) has 
provided low-cost loans to the top five PV manufacturers in the country (USD 30 billion in 2010 alone). Solar 
PV manufacturing is one of the key industries identified 
according to the Catalogue of Chinese High-Technology 
Products for Export which was updated in 2006. Solar 
PV manufacturers are eligible for additional financial 
support for R&D and for export credits at preferential 
rates from the Import–Export Bank of China. They 
are also eligible for export guarantees and insurance 
through the China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation (Zhang et al., 2013).
5.6 Carbon policy
China announced in March 2011 that it would develop 
carbon-emission trading pilot projects to support its 
12th FYP carbon intensity target, signalling its increasing 
interest in the use of market mechanisms (IEPD, 2014; 
Baron et al., 2012).
Carbon trading in China has been in development since 
2008. As policies around climate change and clean 
energy were being developed, private exchanges began to be set up that year. The first such institutions 
were the China Beijing Environment Exchange (CBEEX), 
the Tianjin Climate Exchange (TCX), and the Shanghai 
Environment and Energy Exchange (SEEE). These institutions initially focused on the clean development 
mechanism (CDM) and voluntary carbon credit markets 
(IEPD, 2014). 
In January 2012, the NDRC ordered the seven carbon 
market pilot regions to set a cap on carbon emissions in 
preparation for the launch of their trading schemes. This 
notice also required each region to set up a fund to support the trading scheme and to prepare implementation 
plans. Guangdong’s plan has already been approved by 
the NDRC where the province aims to reduce its carbon 
intensity by 19.5% by 2015 compared to 2010 levels and 
raise its non-fossil-fuel energy share in total energy 
consumption to 20% by 2015. The CO2 emissions cap is 
660 Mt CO2. Compared to the 2007 emissions of 508 Mt 
CO2, this allows room for continued growth in its emissions (IEPD, 2014).
In June 2014, China announced that it will introduce 
an absolute cap on emissions from 2016 as its 13th FYP 
comes into force (Reuters, 2014b). At the same time, the 
government also launched its seventh pilot carbon market, the last before a national scheme which is expected 
to be launched in 2018.
China is promoting emissions trading as one way to 
drive efficiency and carbon emissions cuts across its 
heavy industry sector, thus boosting air quality and 
reducing the country’s contribution to climate change. 
The government is discussing how and whether a national cap and trade scheme, a carbon tax or pollution 
limits will be introduced. Five of the seven provinces 
today have an absolute cap on emissions which could 
also be applied to a national scheme. Beijing has an 
intensity-based target (emissions per unit of GDP) 
(RTCC, 2014).
In order to develop China’s carbon trading system 
further, all pilot projects will be evaluated. The NDRC 
developed the following concept for the development 
of a Certified Emission Reduction trading scheme (Feng, 
2014):
● Enhancement of macro policy:
— The possible development of an emissions 
trading system (ETS) as one of the key tasks 
in pushing forward reforms of the economy 
and establishment of a new ecological cultural system
— The 12th FYP on Social and Economics Development
— A working programme on GHG Emission Control, as part of the 12th FYP
— The decision of the Third Plenary Session of 
the Eighteen Central Committee
● Related preparation works:
— CDM cooperation— The development of a Chinese Certified Emissions Reductions (CCER) trading scheme
Since 2011, seven emissions trading pilot programmes 
have been initiated with the purpose of exploring the 
best approaches and obtaining the necessary experience for the development of a national ETS scheme in 
China. According to Feng (2014), the following trading 
methods are applied in the seven provinces/regions:
● Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hubei: enterprises with 
compulsive responsibility, other approved organizations and individuals are all allowed for trading
● Beijing: enterprises with compulsive responsibility, other approved organisations are both allowed for trading
● Guangdong and Shanghai: Only the enterprises 
with compulsive responsibility are allowed for 
trading now but are considering to include organisations and individuals
● Beijing and Tianjin: Over-the-counter is allowed.
Jotzo, de Boer and Kater (2013) undertook a survey 
from late July to early September 2013, eliciting expectations about the future of China’s carbon price from 
86 China-based experts on carbon pricing and carbon

Note: Trading volume until 21 May 2014markets. The results indicate confidence that China’s 
seven pilot ETS projects will be implemented, with 
prices rising over time and influencing investment decisions. However, there remains significant uncertainty 
about price levels.
There are high expectations that China will introduce 
national emissions trading in combination with a carbon 
price. A significant majority of respondents expect that 
China’s 2020 emissions intensity target will be achieved 
or surpassed, and almost all expect further targets to 
be adopted in 2025 and 2030, possibly in the form of 
absolute limits on emissions.
According to the survey by Jotzo, de Boer and Kater 
(2013), the average carbon price across all the ETS pilot 
projects that are in operation is expected to be around 
RMB 32/t in 2014; RMB 41/t in 2016; and RMB 53/t in 
2018. However, there is considerable uncertainty about 
price levels. For the national ETS, the average price 
expectation (factoring in no scheme and zero price expectations from some of the respondents) rises steadily 
from RMB 29/t in 2018, to RMB 51/t in 2020, and to RMB 
68/t in 2025. As of early September 2014, NDRC indicated the total emissions it could regulate by 2020. These 
would range between 3 billion and 4 billion tonnes of 
CO2 emissions and the market will be worth up to USD 
60 billion at the carbon prices suggested by the NDRC 
(RE New Economy, 2014). This would make the market 
twice as big as the EU, which is currently the world’s 
largest. China plans to start a national market in 2016.
5.7 Electricity pricing
Power prices are generally set by the state for both generation and distribution. The State Electricity Regulatory 
Commission (SERC) was set up in 2002 independent 
from the price setting NDRC. Its tasks were mainly to 
establish and monitor an electricity-trading mechanism 
between power generators and buyers. This trend is 
reversed in the new structure.
In terms of pricing, thermal power plants pay a fixed 
uniform tariff irrespective of the time of day. Prices are 
set a year ahead. Unlike many other markets, China 
lacks short-term and real-time trading of electricity. 
China´s electricity pricing system is controlled by the 
NDRC.
A central renewable energy fund has been established. 
This is mainly supplied through a fixed surcharge on all 
electricity purchases. As renewable growth has picked 
up in recent years, the fund has faced shortfalls. This 
may have contributed to late or non-payment to generators. In order to ensure that the fund is solvent

Source: Based on Jotzo, de Boer and Kater (2013)with more costly solar installations coming online, both 
revenue streams and subsidy outlays to generators will 
need to be modified. Historically the high penetration 
of state-owned energy companies active in the renewable sector have influenced investment decisions. These 
state-owned companies have traditionally had responsibilities to the state besides turning a profit.
There is a considerable difference between residential 
and industrial electricity prices. NDRC and the grid companies agree on provincial electricity costs for residential consumers which are kept purposefully low. While a 
large difference exists between the international average and China’s residential electricity prices, industry 
prices are closer to the global average and much higher 
than residential sector prices in the country.
The “Increasing block tariff” (IBT) is a common pricing 
mechanism used to encourage households to conserve 
electricity. It also divides electricity consumption into 
several blocks for calculating electricity prices (Lo et 
al., 2014). The IBT is often used in addition to subsidy 
programmes for energy-efficient appliances in China to 
help conserve energy use by rewarding low electricity 
consumption or by punishing overconsumption. The 
IBT price of electricity sets a limit beyond which usage 
is charged at a higher price.
The NDRC approved a shift from the single tariff system 
in 2010. However, the use of block tariffs was not 
implemented across China until July 2012 because of 
the potential negative impacts such as the affordability 
of electricity and, partly in consequence, social stability 
(Lo et al., 2014).
China’s IBT has a three-block structure:
● The price for the first block (0–240 kWh per 
month) is subsidised to ensure residents are able 
to afford basic electricity and is expected to cover approximately 80% of electricity consumption
● The price for the second block (241–4,400 kWh) 
is set to recover full costs
● Finally, the price on the third block (4,400 kWh) 
is punitive and considers resource scarcity and 
pollution externalities. Low-income groups are 
allowed to consume a certain amount of electricity at no cost (Lo et al., 2014)
China has a number of electricity pricing 
mechanisms – both for supply and demand. 
Were the electricity market to be established, 
the entire design of the current power sector 
would require significant changes
The tariffs paid to generators of wind and solar power 
were earlier determined by auctions. These auctions 
were then used as the basis for setting the level for the 
FiT. Wind and solar power capacity has grown quickly 
in China. In order to address the issue of solvency of 
the fund, in August 2013, NDRC doubled the electricity 
surcharge for industrial customers. Since a large share 
of China’s total electricity demand is consumed by industrial users, this will make a substantial contribution 
to the fund. Concurrently FiTs for solar were scaled back 
through instituting a regional system similar to that developed for wind (Davidson, 2013a). 
Additionally, on-site distributed solar electricity will receive a RMB 0.42 per kWh subsidy. Any excess electricity 
sold back to the grid, where grid connections and policy 
are in place, will be at the prevailing coal tariff, ranging 
from RMB 0.3 to RMB 0.5 per kWh (USD 5-8 cents per 
kWh). It is unclear if these adjustments will mitigate the 
expected large financial demands required to support 
solar technologies (whose FiT outlays per kWh are still 
more than double that of wind) (Davidson, 2013a).China has significant conventional energy resources. 
Potentially, it also has considerable renewable energy 
sources, most of which are still not utilised. Compared 
with the technical potentials of onshore wind and solar 
capacity, which are close to 3,000 GWe, current installed 
capacities are minimal (Table 13). Resources vary by 
region. The northern parts of China have the best wind 
resources while the southeastern and central parts of 
China have high solar irradiation. The potential for hydro 
lies at 400–700 GWe. By comparison, installed hydro 
capacity in 2012 was about 250 GWe, about two-thirds 
of the total potential.
China is blessed with abundant resources 
of all types of renewable energy sources, a 
small proportion of which are used today
China also has abundant biomass resources, little of 
which are effectively used today. Biomass resources 
are related mostly to agricultural and forest logging 
residues, animal waste and industrial and municipal biodegradable wastes. The straw resource is concentrated 
in the northeast and lower Yangtse River. Furthermore 
there are significant wood resources in the northeast 
and southeast (Sichuan, Shandong, Jilin, Henan).
China produces around 700 Mt straw per year. Some 
37% of this total is corn straw, 28% is rice straw and 20% 
is wheat straw. The remaining 15% includes various other 
crops. Around half of the straw is used for fodder and 
fertiliser. This leaves around half (350 Mt/year) for energy. Around 40% of this amount is already used (Zhang, 
2014). The livestock industry equates to 135-170 Mt of 
animal wastes available for biogas production (Delman 
and Chen, 2008)
Sweet sorghum has the potential to be grown in different parts of China. In northern and southern China it is 
also possible to grow sweet potato. Cassava has a potential to be grown in the middle areas and lower Yangtze River as well as in southwest China (Qiu et al., 2012).
China has limited forest resources and they are not 
evenly distributed across the country. The solid forest products industry is therefore dependent on imports where much of the hardwoods logs are brought 
from tropical sources and softwood logs are imported 
from Pacific Rim nations and Siberia (Bioenergy Crops, 
2013b).
Table 14 shows a breakdown of the total biomass 
supply potential in 2030 by biomass. With the 
exception of Batidzirai, Smeets and Faaij (2012), no 
other study provides a potential for energy crops. 
The total supply potential of forest products, their 
residues, agricultural residues and waste according to 
the four studies range from 9 EJ to 19 EJ (307 Mtce 
to 648 Mtce) (excluding energy crops) by 2030.
There is a biomass supply potential 
ranging from 9 EJ to 19 EJ in China by 2030 
but only a limited amount of this is used 
effectively today
By 2030, IRENA estimates that the supply costs of biomass will range from USD 3 to USD 12 per GJ. The lower

● Options have been identified that could raise 
China’s renewable energy use in terms of TFEC 
to approximately 23 EJ (770 Mtce) by 2030 
(equivalent to 26% in the share of TFEC). This 
includes the full substitution of traditional uses 
of biomass with modern renewables.
● Some 49% of the total renewable energy use in 
REmap 2030 is related to renewable power options.
● Various forms of biomass (such as power, heat, 
motor fuel) and solar (PV, CSP, thermal) would 
account for 60% of the total renewable energy 
use in REmap 2030.
● 40% of the REmap Options that have been identified in the power sector are related to solar, 
one-third to biomass and 20% to wind. The 
remainder is related to geothermal. REmap Options for renewable heating and transportation 
account for two-thirds of the total.
● Total wind capacity would increase by 13 times 
compared with 2012. Solar and geothermal capacity would both increase by a factor of six or 
seven.
● Total biomass use would double from 2012. While 
traditional use of biomass is fully substituted between 2010 and 2030, modern uses of biomass 
increase by five times in the same period.
● Additional biomass use potential is concentrated 
in heating markets (building and industry), including the district heat generation sector.
● The total package of REmap Options identified 
requires additional costs of USD 5.6 per GJ (RMB 
1 230 per tce) for consumers and USD 6.9 per GJ 
(RMB 1 480 per tce) for society (USD 55-60 bln/
year additional costs; RMB 375-410 billion per 
year). These costs exclude savings from the benefits of renewable energy from improved human 
health and reduced CO2 emissions.
● Costs are outweighed by estimated savings due 
to external effects from air pollution, including 
a reduction of 1,690 Mt of CO2 per year in 2030.
● There are challenges for wind and biomass related to connecting supply and demand, and costs 
associated with these. Furthermore, barriers related to permitting, licensing and other regulatory issues need to be resolved in order to build 
the necessary transmission grid. While a part of 
the bioenergy demand in end-use sectors could 
be met with local feedstock availability, domestic 
logistics for bioenergy trade must be developed 
to meet demand spread across the country.
The Reference Case (i.e. business as usual) analysis for 
China utilizes an internally developed REmap tool that 
incorporates the estimates of the IEA WEO New Policies Scenario and CNREC for the year 2030. The data, 
assumptions and approach used have been summarised 
above in Section 4. The tool allows IRENA to enter additional renewable energy options in the end-use sectors 
of industry, buildings, and transport, as well as for power 
and district heat generation. The process for the REmap 
Options was as follows:
1) Reference Case for the period between 2010 and 
2030 was created. The results of this projection 
are explained in Section 4,
2) Commodities and fuel prices were prepared to 
reflect the national situation,
3) Technology cost and performance criteria (e.g.,
capacity factors) were prepared to reflect the 
national situation,
4) Additional renewable energy options for all enduse sectors and the power sector were analysed 
based on various study and assessments.
The following studies have been used to identify additional renewable energy options beyond the Reference 
Case:
a. For power sector: CNREC estimates, historical 
trends, IEA estimates and IRENA renewable energy industry roadmap and its accompanying 
data were used (for biomass power generation 
from CHP) (IRENA, 2014b),
b. For transport sector: IRENA estimates were used,
c. For industry sector: a recent IRENA renewable 
energy in industry roadmap (IRENA, 2014b) and 
its accompanying data was used; only renewable 
energy options for new capacity were considered.
7 REMAP OPTIONSd. For building sector: an internal analysis of Reference Case developments and REmap Options 
was used in addition to the draft “Roadmap 
Research of China Solar Thermal Development” 
(Ruicheng, Tao and Xuan, 2014).
This section is divided into five sub-sections. Section 7.1 
focuses on the potentials of different renewable energy 
technologies in China and also mentions the top regions with resource availability. Section 7.2 provides the 
REmap Options. In Section 7.3, costs of REmap Options 
are estimated and Section 7.4 presents the cost-supply 
curves for the REmap Options. Section 7.5 discusses 
these findings.
7.1 Renewable energy 
technologies
Wind
The potential for wind lies mainly in the northwest and 
northeast, and partly in the east of the country. In these 
regions, wind speeds easily exceed 8-9 m/s and capacity factors reach between 20% and 40% (IEA, 2011a; 
He and Kammen, 2014). However, the ability to deliver 
electricity to consumers in the southern and eastern 
parts of the country is a challenge given existing grid 
infrastructure.
A regional approach has been chosen in determining 
the potential of wind in China by distinguishing between 
high and low capacity factor regions. More than twothirds of the total wind potential is assumed in regions 
with large wind resources, mainly east and west Inner 
Mongolia as well as Xinjiang, Gansu and Jiangsu (where 
capacity factors reach up to 35%). The remaining potential is assumed in regions with moderate availability of 
wind resources (those with capacity factors of around 
20%).
A total of 246 GWe capacity has been assumed as 
Remap Options on top of the capacity identified in the 
Reference Case. This results in a total installed capacity 
of 561 GWe in REmap 2030, which is much lower than 
the technical potential of approximately 2,500 GWe. 
Realising this potential would imply the deployment of 
all possible installed capacity in Inner Mongolia, Xjiang, 
Gansu, Hebei, Jilin and Jiangsu (IEA, 2011a). To realise 
this high wind potential, it is also assumed that some of 
the coal plants built between 2010 and 2030 are retired 
early, in particular in western China. The total capacity 
growth is ambitious requiring about 24 GWe/year of onshore wind capacity deployment, double current levels. 
For offshore wind, the growth is about 3 GWe/year.
Solar PV and CSP
In the southwest and to the north of China, solar irradiance levels range from 1,500 to 2,000 kWh/m2/year. 
So far most solar capacity is also installed in this band, 
notable in Qinghai. Most of the rest of the capacity is 
assumed to be deployed in this region as well, but with 
rooftop solar PV distributed in other parts of China as 
well. The average capacity factor is estimated as 17% for 
utility-scale projects, and about 15% for rooftop solar 
PV. An additional 169 GWe in the 2010-2030 period (on 
top of the 139 GWe in the Reference Case in 2030) was 
assumed in REmap 2030. In total, by 2030, 309 GWe of 
solar PV would be installed (of which 118 GWe is rooftop), 
representing an installation rate of around 16 GWe per 
year. Most of the utility-scale solar PV will be installed in 
western parts of China whereas distributed solar PV will 
be spread across the country, but mainly in the eastern 
parts of the country.
Solar CSP could also play a further role in China, mainly 
in parts where solar PV also has potential, such as Xinjiang and Qinghai. Without storage, the capacity factor 
would be around 17%. An additional 20 GWe on top of 
the Reference Case of 12 GWe is assumed in REmap 
2030.
Geothermal
Geothermal resources are available in many areas, but 
in most locations the temperatures are moderate, ranging from 30-90o C. Since 1990, the use of geothermal 
energy for space heating, recreational bathing and spas, 
and cultivation has evolved rapidly.
High-temperature geothermal resources do exist, but 
they are limited to a few locations in southern Tibet, 
western Yunnan and western Sichuan, on the Himalayan Geothermal Belt. Thus far, total installed capacity is 
27 MWe. As of 2006, 181 geothermal systems had been 
found on mainland China, with an estimated generation 
potential of 1.74 GWe. This is small compared with the 
overall power demand needs and most of this capacity 
is assumed to be deployed in the Reference Case. In 
REmap Options, no additional capacity is assumed.Biomass/biogas
As discussed in Section 5, China has considerable biomass potentials which are not utilised to their full extent 
yet. These include a mix of agricultural residues, waste 
and forest products. To some extent, straw production 
is already utilised, so is fuel wood in traditional forms. 
However, there is also a major potential for the use of 
modern forms of biomass in the heating sector and 
partly for power generation, in particular in industrial 
combined heat and power (CHP) plants.
Central and northeastern parts of China have large stalk 
and straw potential which accounts for the majority of 
the total supply in China. The southwest has limited 
potential for agricultural residues. Fuel wood potential 
is distributed in the southern and central parts of China. 
As for animal manure, the main potential is in the 
southern and central regions as well as in northeastern 
China (Jingying et al., 2001). Forest-based bioenergy 
use is in its infancy in China, but there is now a midterm goal to develop forest-based bioenergy in those 
southern and eastern parts of China which are in close 
proximity to ethanol and biodiesel plants (Bioenergy 
Crops, 2013a).
An additional 27 GWe of biomass power generation (including 6 GWe CHP used in industry) has been assumed 
on top of the 38 GWe identified in the Reference Case, 
as well as an additional 2.2 EJ of modern biomass for 
heating in industry and buildings (on top of the 3.1 EJ in 
the Reference Case). All traditional biomass use in the 
2030 Reference Case of 2.9 EJ is substituted.
Figure 14 shows total primary bioenergy demand based 
on REmap 2030 reaching 12 EJ per year (410 Mtce), 
which based on the biomass supply literature review 
would represent two-thirds of the high end of the supply potential (8-19 EJ). Compared with the low-end of 
the total supply potential, demand could be higher. This 
implies that a large share of the bioenergy resource 
potential of China would be used. 30% of this total 
would be consumed in the building sector followed by 
a quarter for power generation. The demand for biofuel 
production and for heating in industry and district heat 
sectors account for 45% of the total demand.
Hydro
Of the total potential for hydroelectricity, all the economic potential of 400 GWe is assumed to be deployed

assumed in REmap 2030.
Additional potential of renewables in end-use 
sectors
The analysis can still be expanded to include additional 
renewable energy options, particularly in end-use sectors where no comprehensive accelerated renewable 
energy scenarios are available. In industry, retrofits for 
biomass medium/high temperature process heat (to a 
large extent increasing the share of biomass and waste 
in the fuel mix of cement kilns) and solar thermal for 
low/medium temperature heat could be considered. 
Assuming about 20% of the total energy demand of the 
cement industry is provided by biomass and waste by 
2030, a total of about 0.6 EJ of fuel would be required. 
Another 0.5 EJ of biomass for heat production in industrial CHP plants and 0.3 EJ of biomass for steam boilers 
are assumed that would account for about 2% of the 
sector’s total energy demand for process heat generation (WBCSD, 2009; IRENA, 2014b).
In REmap 2030, total solar thermal capacity in China 
is expected to reach 1,500 million m2. Hence REmap 
Options represent an additional potential in 2030 of 
700  million m2 compared to the Reference Case of 
800 million m2. Building sector accounts for 70% of the 
capacity installed by 2030 (60% residential and 10% 
commercial). The remaining 30% is located in the industry sector. The major task is to substitute traditional 
uses of biomass with modern cooking stoves and to 
continue to increase the use of solar thermal for water/
space heating.
For the REmap analysis it is assumed that that the 
package of electric two-wheelers, extended metro and 
broader use of electric buses can replace 20% of the 
projected car demand in 2030. As for road transportation, a significant amount of the capacity is needed to 
haul coal from the mines to the centres of demand. The 
REmap Options could reduce coal demand by around 
5%. It is estimated that this will reduce road transportation demand by around 1% in 2030.
7.2 Roadmap table and 
implications for renewable 
energy
REmap results in a significant increase in the amount 
of renewable energy consumed as a proportion of the 
total. In 2010, about 7.4 EJ/year of renewable energy 
was consumed in China. 60% of that was in different 
forms of biomass. The only other sizable contributions 
were from renewable electricity in the form of hydro 
and renewable heating from solar thermal in the building sector.

Renewable energy in TFEC (PJ/year)
2010 2030 Reference Case REmap 2030In the Reference Case for 2030 an additional 7.2 EJ of 
renewable energy will be consumed, resulting in total 
renewable energy use of 14.6 EJ. The REmap Options 
show an additional 8.4 EJ of renewable energy. In 
REmap 2030, renewable energy use in the TFEC would 
reach 23 EJ. Compared with 2010 level, this is an addition of 15.6 EJ. Figure 15 shows the anticipated increase 
for each renewable energy resource. The largest growth 
in absolute terms is in the use of solar (including both 
PV and thermal applications), in total approximately 
6 EJ between 2010 and 2030. Biomass, wind and hydro 
additions are each 3 EJ in the same time period.
Biomass may still be the largest source of renewable 
energy in REmap 2030, but it is actually solar, hydro and 
wind that show the highest growth rates.
There is scope to more than triple 2010 levels 
of renewable energy consumption to 23 EJ 
by 2030, with solar PV and solar thermal 
accounting for 40% of the total potential 
beyond the Reference Case
Figure 16 shows the breakdown of renewable energy 
by consuming sector between 2010 and REmap 2030. 
Note that biomass as an energy source changes significantly, as its traditional use in the building sector is 
replaced with modern alternatives. Also, the growth in 
biomass use is not seen in the power sector, rather in 
the form of biofuels and residue combustion for heating 
used in industry.
The other changes include a significant increase in solar 
thermal use in both the building and industrial sectors. In the power sector, hydroelectricity remains the 
largest source of electricity, however wind increases 
its share tenfold over 2010 levels. Solar PV goes from 
being almost non-existent in 2010 to comprising 6% of 
all renewable energy use by 2030, becoming the third 
most important source of renewable electricity in 2030. 
The power sector gains nearly a 50% share in the total 
renewable energy market by 2030, compared with 29% 
in 2010.
Renewable power and heating applications 
each would account for about half of the 
total renewable energy use in 2030 if all 
REmap Options are implemented
Table 15 below shows the results of these increases on 
the share of renewable energy. When excluding traditional uses of biomass, modern renewable energy use 
increases from 7% of the total in 2010 (13% if traditional 
biomass is included), to over 16% in the Reference Case. 
When the REmap Options are included the share of 
modern renewable energy in the total mix can be raised 
to 26%.

Power sector
End-use sectorThe building sector leads in terms of renewable use, 
largely driven by the high levels of solar thermal use and 
biomass, followed by industry and transport. Renewable 
energy in power generation increases to almost 40%, 
with half of that, or 20% of all generation, coming from 
solar PV, CSP and wind.
Renewable energy use by the manufacturing 
industry and building sectors (including 
renewable power consumed in these sectors) 
would account for 90% of the total renewable 
energy use in REmap 2030
Figure 17 shows how the REmap Options would change 
the primary energy fuel mix in 2030. Renewables become the second largest contributor of energy services 
in total primary energy demand (TPED)17 based on both 
methodologies used to convert renewable energy to 
primary energy. The “RE high” calculation uses the US 
Energy Information Agency’s partial substitution method while the “RE low” calculation uses the IEA physical 
17 There are different methods applied to estimate the total primary 
energy demand. The two applied in this study are the “physical 
energy content” and “substitution” methods. The physical energy 
content method is used by the IEA and Eurostat where renewable 
electricity and biofuels are counted as primary energy as they appear in the form of secondary energy, while geothermal, CSP and 
nuclear are counted using average process efficiencies to convert 
them into primary energy equivalents. The substitution method is 
used by the US EIA and BP where renewable electricity and heat 
are converted into primary energy using the average efficiency of 
the fossil fuel power and heat plants which would otherwise be 
required to produce these quantities. 
energy content method. These do not represent different cases, or levels of renewable energy consumption, 
rather differences in converting renewable electricity 
and heat into primary equivalents.
In primary terms, renewable energy increases between 
42% and 48% over the 2030 Reference Case. Coal sees 
the most significant reduction, with 18% fuel savings to 
about 65 EJ of primary fuel (2 220 Mtce) but remains 
the largest source of primary energy. Natural gas sees 
the second largest reduction of 9%, and is the fourth 
largest energy carrier after coal, oil and renewables. Oil 
is the third largest contributor of primary energy and 
sees only a 7% reduction. Finally nuclear remains unchanged and the smallest contributor to primary energy 
(using the IEA method).
Table 16 goes into more detail about the energy system, 
including data for 2010 (the analysis base year), the 
2030 Reference Case, and REmap 2030 which includes 
the REmap Options. The renewable energy share in the 
TFEC, when excluding traditional biomass, increases 
from 7% in 2010 to 16% in 2030 according to the Reference Case (or from 14% to 17% if including traditional 
use of biomass).
Implementing all REmap Options can raise the renewable energy share to 26% in REmap 2030. This will result 
in total renewable energy use of 23 EJ/year (770 Mtce) 
by 2030. This consists of 0.9 EJ liquid biofuels, 11.5 EJ 
renewables for heat in end-use sectors and 10.1 EJ reTable 15: Breakdown of renewable energy share by sector

in additional power generation of about 280 TWh/year 
in REmap 2030 compared with the Reference Case, i.e.
3% additional electricity demand. Biofuels used in transport will total 0.9 EJ, with 18% coming from advanced 
biofuels.
The share of renewable power generation grows to 39% 
in REmap 2030. Half of this, or 18% of the total power 
generated, is considered variable power which includes 
solar PV, CSP and wind. Growth in the power sector’s 
renewable energy share is substantial compared with 
the Reference Case. This is due to growth in wind (more 
than 617 TWh/year), solar PV (233 TWh/year), and biomass including industrial CHP (168 TWh/year). Hydro 
and geothermal see no increase compared with the 
Reference Case.
Figure 18 shows developments in power capacity. If 
the trends to 2020 targets are extrapolated assuming 
exponential growth, the capacity for renewables could 
grow to 1 200-1 600 GWe in 2030. This is represented by 
the REmap 2030 total of 1 467 GWe. Wind nearly doubles to 561 GWe (including 60 GWe offshore) in REmap 
2030, compared with 315 GWe in the Reference Case. 
Solar PV increases to 308 GWe, up from 109 GWe in the 
Reference Case. Solar CSP increases to 32 GWe, a threefold increase over the Reference Case installed capacity 
of 12 GWe. Total hydroelectricity capacity increases by 
nearly 150 GWe between 2010 and REmap 2030, from 
215 GWe to 400 GWe.
The increases in renewable power substitute coal capacity. This results in 180 GWe less coal in REmap 2030 of 
which 45 GWe is accounted for the early retirement of 
existing plants and substitution with wind power. There 
remains over 850 GWe of coal power generation capacity in the system, even after the substitution. However, 
this is less than the total of current installed (750 GWe) 
and planned coal capacity (350 GWe) as of 2011 (Platts, 
2013).
The renewable energy share ranges between 10% and 
64% in end-use sectors. This growth is mainly from 
biomass which accounts for more than half of the total 
renewable energy fuel use (when excluding electricity). 
Primary biomass demand for modern and traditional 
applications in China doubles from 6.1 EJ in 2010 to

CSPnearly 12 EJ in REmap 2030 if all REmap Options are deployed (demand in all sectors). This growth is tempered 
by the substitution of traditional uses of biomass with 
modern biomass which is by a factor 2-3 more efficient 
in comparison.
One third-of the total renewable energy use in REmap 
2030 is from biomass, and it has a higher share in enduse sector total renewable energy use of 60%. The contribution of non-biomass renewable energy technologies to supply heat in the building and industry sectors 
is also substantial, with solar thermal at 5 EJ and geothermal at 0.3 EJ. Solar thermal capacity in 2030 would 
reach 1,050 GWth (or 1 500 million m2). About 40% of the 
total installed capacity would be in the industrial (30%) 
and commercial (10%) sectors in 2030. The number of 
electric vehicles increases to 35 million in REmap 2030. 
This would represent more than 10% of the total car 
stock in 2030. The number of two-wheelers would reach 
500 million in 2030.
7.3 Renewable energy technology 
cost projections
Table 17 provides an overview of current and projected 
LCOE for new capacity power plants. In REmap renewable power technologies only substitute coal-based 
generation. In the absence of a carbon price the cost of 
new coal power is expected to rise to around USD 50 
per megawatt-hour (MWh). Substitution of coal generation includes both new capacity and existing capacity, 
which produces electricity closer to USD 20 per MWh. 
Due to China’s abundance of coal, renewable technologies do not compete on cost alone, as shown by the 
USD 16 per GJ substitution cost for the REmap Options 
in the power sector.
REmap projects that generation costs for wind will remain relatively stable, at USD 78-95 per MWh. Another 
‘remote’ wind onshore option is identified. This refers to 
wind farms installed in regions which have high capacity factors, but which are more distant from the existing 
grid and may also require higher capital costs for their 
construction and equipment transportation.
Contrary to the wind, the cost of solar PV will decrease 
significantly to around USD 60-120 per MWh by 2030. 
Utility scale plants have an LCOE of USD 60-75 per kWh 
compared with distributed solar PV plants, which have 
an LCOE of USD 90-120 per kWh. However, it should be 
noted that costs related to the integration of various 
renewables are outside the scope of this study, and 
according to the IEA could add between USD 5 and USD

GlobalData.25 per MWh. These additional costs could have an effect 
on the ranking of the price of power generation. Landfill 
gas will remain competitive with new coal power plants.
According to IEA estimates (IEA, 2011a; not shown in the 
table below), wind power generation costs vary considerably depending on the region and as installed capacity rises. For example, as the installed capacity increases 
from 45 GW to about 200 GW in West Inner Mongolia, 
LCOE increases from USD 54 per MWh to about USD 70 
per MWh. For the same installed capacity (for 45 GWe), 
LCOE ranges from USD 50 per MWh in Gansu to USD 74 
per MWh in Heibei. To reach 400 GWe installed capacity 
by 2030, IEA estimates an LCOE range of USD 64-84 
per MWh across the seven regions with the largest wind 
resources18. This is similar to the REmap 2030 estimates 
for 467 GWe installed wind onshore capacity.
By 2030, onshore wind, utility-scale solar PV 
and landfill gas/biomass will be the cheapest 
sources of renewable power generation
System costs such as transmission can have an important effect on overall estimates. According to the 
IEA (2011a), by 2020 the estimated average LCOE for 
wind would be equivalent to USD 56 per MWh, when 
transmission costs are excluded. When these costs are 
factored in, the additional cost the LCOE rises to USD 79 
per MWh (a 36% increase).
Taking these costs into account, more than 200 GWe of 
wind capacity could be implemented in high-resource 
regions by 2020, which would require the continuation 
of annual capacity development rates today. By 2030, 
the LCOE (excluding transmission costs) could increase 
to 60 per MWh, versus tariffs which include transmission costs of USD 80 per MWh. This would result in a 
total installed capacity of more than 400 GWe by 2030. 
Transmission costs would add 30-40% to the overall 
sum.
According to the “high renewable scenario” laid out by 
the WWF (2014), which foresees a 56% share of renewable energy in power generation by 2030 (22% from 
wind and 18% from hydro, with the remainder a 16% mix 
of solar PV and biomass), there would be a weighted 
18 The seven regions analysed by the IEA (2011a) are Gansu, Heibei, 
Jiangsu, Jilin, East and West Inner Mongolia.
LCOE of USD 85 per MWh (for all technologies including 
conventional). The cost of transmission and the costs of 
demand/peak reduction measures and storage would 
add USD 46 per MWh, resulting in total generation and 
system costs of USD 131 per MWh by 2030.
BNEF (2013) estimates total capital investment requirements of USD 3 256 billion between 2013 and 
2030 to increase the installed capacity from 1 124 GWe
to 2 867  GWe. Of this total installed capacity, half of 
it would be renewable energy. Of the total net capacity additions estimated between 2013 and 2030 
(1 743 GWe), about two-thirds is renewables (1 110 GWe) 
and of that about 900 GWe is related to wind and solar 
PV. Additional investment requirements for supporting 
infrastructure related to these capacity additions are estimated as USD 1,123 billion in that period, adding about 
a third on top of the total capital investment. About 45% 
of the estimated infrastructure investments are related 
to transmission lines, while one-third is related to smart 
grids; and additional 17% is related to storage while the 
remainder 5% is related to demand response.
In the building and industrial sectors, the outlook is also 
challenging for renewable energy technologies due to 
the availability of cheap coal (see Annex E for an overview of these sector end-use costs). Due to this cheap 
supply, many types of renewable energy technologies 
that provide space heating or process heat will find it 
hard to compete based on price alone, meaning that 
their substitution costs are a positive factor.
In the transport sector, the outlook for renewable energy is better. Since oil is traded internationally and China 
is a net importer, the price per barrel of crude in China 
does not deviate much from increases seen around the 
world. For REmap a modest price increase is forecast, 
amounting to a barrel price of around USD 120 by 2030 
(based on a lower heating value of 5.4 GJ per barrel of 
oil equivalent), which translates to a price for petrol that 
increases from USD 23 in 2010 to USD 32 per GJ in 2030 
– an increase of around 50%, assuming no changes in 
petrol taxes.
Additionally, because China is a rapidly urbanising society and income levels are increasing, the car stock in 
China is expected to increase from 100 million in 2012 
to about 500 million in 2030. If this were to happen, 
the increased demand for petrol would put even higher 
pressure on petroleum prices. This would enable many types of alternative transport technologies or fuels to 
compete on a cost-basis. However, because many alternatives exist, ranging from biofuels to electromobility, 
and because there are infrastructure costs associated 
with increased uptake, the cost structure of these technologies are still hard to estimate.
What is clear, however, is that most of these technologies pose a realistic potential to compete with petrol use 
in transport on a cost-basis, according to the methodology applied and the cost data (capital and operation 
and maintenance (O&M) costs, energy prices and discount rates) used in this study. This growth also presents 
an opportunity for China to increase the use of transport 
modes that consume electricity rather than liquid fuels 
– so called modal shifts. These include supporting the 
introduction of local electric bus and tram systems, 
as well as long-distance rail for both passengers and 
freight. This is already being pursued aggressively in 
China; however, REmap assumes more could be done 
and at significant cost-savings.
7.4 Summary of REmap Options: 
cost-supply curves
The previous sections have discussed the technology 
options and their costs. In this section, the options are 
aggregated into an overall potential curve, and they are 
ranked in terms of their cost effectiveness.
The cost-supply curve displays an approximate representation for the realistic potential of renewable energy

Note 2: The purple bars represent electrification technologies. The substitution costs of these technologies include their annualised capital 
(e.g., electric vehicle ownership cost), O&M and energy costs vs those of their conventional counterparts (e.g., ICE passenger car running with 
gasoline). It is also assumed that each additional electrification technology will result in renewable power generation capacity investments; 
hence, it is assumed they consume electricity from renewable sources only. These costs are included via the electricity prices that account for 
the changes in China’s power generation mix. As opposed to depicting the energy demand technologies (e.g., electric vehicle, heat pumps), 
bars for electrification technologies could also be represented by the renewable electricity supply technologies which consists of 70% wind 
and 30% solar PV in the case of the China.technologies – the REmap Options – which can be deployed by 2030 in addition to the Reference Case. The 
cost supply curve is not used to develop the REmap 
2030, but it is a representation of the REmap Options 
which have been selected.
The REmap Options are a portfolio of technologies for 
accelerated renewable energy deployment in the power, 
district heat, and end-use sectors of buildings, industry 
and transport. This portfolio is not an allocation of the 
global additional potential based on the GDP of China 
and the other 25 REmap countries, nor does it represent extrapolations. Further technology portfolios can 
be generated based on the different understanding of 
the parameters that constitute REmap Options or other 
studies looking at the specific case of the China.
The results of the analysis are shown in the cost-supply 
curves in Figure 19 through Figure 22. This includes two 
sets of curves: one based on national prices (business 
perspective) that incorporate the national cost of capital (8% discount rate), commodity prices that include 
national taxes or subsidies, and technology cost and 
performance characteristics; and another (government 
perspective) based on standard international commodities costs (with differentiation made for coal and natural 
gas between export and import countries) and a fixed 
10% discount rate.
The former reflects factors likely to influence private 
investment decisions; the latter is more relevant to government decisions on policy and spending. Each of these 
two curves is presented twice, once coloured by resource 
and once by sector. The national cost supply curves are 
used to examine the economic cost and financial savings 
potential of increased renewable energy uptake. The 
standard international curve is used when considering 
R&D needs, comparing renewable potential and costs 
across regions or globally as well as providing insight 
into cost differences between China and global markets 
resulting from policy decisions such as energy taxation.
Decision makers will be tempted to pick low-cost options, from the left end of the curve, and to skip highFigure 20: REmap Options cost supply curve, business perspective, by sector

Transport with renewable electricitycost options, on the right-hand side; however the figure 
gives a perspective of the entire country. Decision makers may assume that options represented by individual 
blocks in the supply curve are homogenous in terms of 
substitution costs. However, the blocks represent averages based on the assumed deployments in the REmap 2030. A focus on the cheapest individual options 
will not result in the least expensive overall transition; 
achieving that requires a holistic approach, and only 
when all of these options are pursued simultaneously 
can the share of renewables in TFEC of China be raised 
to 26% by 2030 according to this study.
In Figure 20 (below) the same curve is displayed but 
with the technologies coloured by sector. This curve 
shows that the additional potential lies largely in the 
building, industry and power sectors.
Focusing on the cheapest individual options 
will not result in the least expensive overall 
transition; a holistic approach is required
Figure 21 and Figure 22 are the REmap cost-supply 
curves for China based on standardised international 
commodity price estimates (which exclude the effects 
of taxation or subsidy) and a 10% discount rate. The 
curve is significantly different from the national one, 
resulting from the changes relating to the discount rate 
(10% versus 8%), and energy prices. In addition to showing cost differences driven by commodity prices that 
are locked into a local market (such as natural gas), this 
curve also shows the effects of price differences resulting from subsidies and taxes on energy and how they 
can affect technology deployment. This curve is also 
used to look at regional and international contexts when 
comparing the results from China.
A sector-based cost curve shows that most 
additional potential lies in the housing, 
industry and power sectors
For the REmap cost-supply curves, the Reference Case 
growth in renewable energy from 2010-2030 is shown 
by the first horizontal bar, which is coloured based on 
resource. The resource colouring is consistent with the 
deployment of renewable energy seen in the Reference 
Case. The results of the REmap analysis and accelerated 
deployment of renewable energy (the REmap Options) 
is plotted in the curve as coloured bars showing the additional potential of each technology (on the x-axis) and 
the average incremental cost of substitution of deploying that technology in lieu of a conventional variant (on 
the y-axis). The Reference Case already includes some 
significant expansion of renewable resources: wind and 
solar already see growth in the Reference Case and their 
incremental potential is lower in the REmap Options. In 
China, modern renewable energy in TFEC according to 
the Reference Case is expected to grow from 7% in 2010 
to about 16% by 2030.
Cost-curve results by sector and technology
The results presented in these cost supply curves are 
dependent on projections of technology cost and fuel 
prices. An overview of the assumptions underlying these 
projections is available in the Annexes. The technology 
option mix and costs vary according to sector. Costs associated with the Reference Case are not quantified as 
they are part of expected energy system developments 
and outside the boundaries of the REmap analysis.
The results from the REmap cost-supply curves show 
that some of the REmap Options identified, if viewed 
from a business perspective (national prices), could be

Average of all sectors 5.6 6.9deployed at a cost-saving when compared with fossil 
fuel alternatives. Table 15 shows the average cost of 
substitution for each sector. If viewed from a business 
perspective, the REmap Options require additional costs 
of USD 5.6 per GJ. If viewed from the perspective of 
government (international prices), the cost of substitution increases to USD 6.9 per GJ, assuming the removal 
of tax on fossil fuels (since biomass is taxed relatively little and other renewable energy technologies that have 
no fuel demand are not affected by fuel taxes) and a 
high discount rate of 10% (most renewable energy technologies have higher capital costs). This is higher than 
the global average of USD 2.5 per GJ estimated based 
on the analysis of 26 REmap countries (IRENA, 2014a).
The cost-supply curve results from the business perspective show that most of the technologies result in 
incremental costs when compared with their conventional alternatives. However, to put these incremental 
costs into perspective, the incremental cost average of 
USD 5.6 per GJ of final energy is actually equivalent to 
an increase of around USD 20 per MWh, or around USD 
2 cents per kWh. This is also despite China having some 
of the lowest fossil fuel prices in the world, particularly the extremely cheap coal used in the industry and 
power sectors. This also explains why most renewable 
energy options which are cost-effective are those that 
substitute petroleum products (largely in transport) or 
fuels used in the building sector (including traditional 
biomass). However, as shown in Table 21, if externalities 
are factored into the cost of substitution, the REmap 
Options as a whole result in cost-savings compared with 
their conventional alternatives. The cost-supply curves 
do not display these external costs since both health 
and environment costs are not internalised into the substitution process – they are apportioned in a later step.
Most cost-effective renewable energy 
options in China are those that substitute 
petroleum products (mainly in transport) or 
fuels used in the building sector
In the power sector all technologies result in incremental 
costs when compared with conventional alternatives. 
This is due to low coal prices, and also because some 
renewables are assumed to replace existing coal power 
plants. The most competitive renewable energy technology is landfill gas and electricity generated from 
biomass such as CHP plants that utilise agricultural 
residues. Utility-scale solar PV, onshore wind and geothermal are next, resulting in incremental costs close to 
the total average substitution costs of USD 6 per GJ. 
Solar PV for rooftop applications result in an incremental substitution cost of around USD 17 per GJ. However, 
it is important to note this is compared with wholesale 
power cost as for all power generation technologies, not 
retail electricity. Lastly offshore wind, and wind plants 
that substitute existing coal plants result in the highest 
cost of substitution of all technologies.
In the industrial sector results are similar, also due to 
the availability of cheap coal that does not internalise 
health or environmental costs. Industrial process heat 
generated from biomass-fired CHP plants using agricultural residues is the most cost-competitive option. Two 
novel, yet largely unused technologies, follow in terms 
of competitiveness: solar cooling, which replaces electric cooling, followed by heat pumps providing process 
heat for temperatures of up to 150 oC. Both of these 
technologies compete well, with only around USD 3 per 
GJ incremental costs. The largest potential is found in 
solar thermal for low-temperature heat applications; 
however, the cost of substitution is the highest among 
all technologies in the industry sector (USD 11 per GJ).
The building sector includes renewable technologies 
that substitute both fossil fuels and traditional use of biomass. The most competitive is modern biomass-based 
space heating that substitutes heating oil, mainly due to 
high oil product prices. Heat pumps also result in costsavings when substituting natural gas; however, their 
potential is lower than biomass. Modern renewablebased cooking results in cost-savings when compared 
with traditional uses of biomass when modern solid 
biomass is used. Utilising biogas for heating or cooking 
applications instead of traditional forms of biomass results in only a small incremental cost. The largest potential is in solar thermal heating, as in the case of industry, 
which is already very prevalent in China. REmap shows 
this additional potential can be deployed at a relatively 
low incremental cost. It is important to note that China 
has a significant district heating network in many cities, 
and REmap shows that waste-to-energy systems can 
provide significant additional potential, however at an 
incremental cost above the average.
The transport sector has the most competitive set of 
renewable technology options. This is due to the high 
cost of oil, which mirrors world prices, relative to the lower cost of coal used in the other sectors. Technologies that utilise electricity, which in China is cheap, result in the most cost savings. Developing passenger 
rail networks that substitute aviation, or urban tram or 
subway systems that substitute passenger automobiles, 
result in significant savings. However, China is building significant infrastructure for these technologies, 
so only limited additional potential is available beyond 
the Reference Case. Forms of individual electric transit, 
including various forms of electric vehicles and electric 
2-3 wheelers are also cost competitive. However there 
is significant growth in these technologies already assumed in the Reference Case, so additional potential 
identified in REmap 2030 is also limited. Electric mobility technologies have high efficiency compared with 
fossil alternatives, so even though they seem small in 
energy consumption terms, they provide significantly 
better performance (in terms of passenger miles, for 
instance) than a comparable unit of petrol or diesel. No 
liquid biofuel growth has been assumed for China in 
REmap 2030 beyond the Reference Case.
Benefits of REmap Options
In addition to economic arguments for increased renewable energy deployment, there is also a strong 
environmental case. The REmap Options would result 
in an estimated reduction of 1.7 gigatonnes (Gt) of CO2
by 2030 (Table 19). The largest decrease would occur in 
the building sector, followed by the power sector. If all 
REmap Options were fully deployed, China could reduce 
its CO2-related emissions from energy combustion by 
around 17% over the 2030 Reference Case.
Reductions in emissions from China would contribute 
21% of the global CO2 emission reductions which could 
be achieved if all REmap Options required for doubling 
the global renewable energy share are implemented 
by 2030 (a total of 1.7 Gt CO2 emission reductions by 
2030). Among the 26 REmap countries, China has the 
largest potential in terms of an absolute reduction in 
emission volumes. China is followed by the reduction 
potentials of the USA and India if all REmap Options are 
to be implemented. These three countries could account 
for half of the potential reductions in global emissions 
according to REmap 2030. Deploying renewables and 
reducing emissions in these countries are essential for 
a transition in the global energy system and to mitigate 
climate change.
China, the USA and India together could 
account for half of global reductions in 
emissions by 2030 if all Remap Options are 
implemented
These emission reduction estimates assume that all 
renewable energy sources are carbon-neutral. While 
this applies to most renewables, it is not the case 
for biomass due to GHG emissions during bioenergy 
harvesting, processing and combustion, in particular 
when land use change emissions are accounted for. In 
addition, emission estimates are subject to uncertainty 
originating from the discrepancies in China’s energy 
statistics, mainly related to coal use in coal washing and 
the manufacturing and industrial sectors. For the year 
2010, the margin of error for China’s total CO2 output 
is estimated as 1.4 Gt, which is nearly as high as the 
total emissions avoided under REmap 2030 (Guan et 
al., 2014). With better data, total energy use projections 
and thus CO2 emission saving estimates can be refined.

Total emissions from fossil fuel 
combustion for energy services 6 917 10 185 8 493 1 692If all REmap Options are implemented in 
2030, total emissions from the building and 
power sectors of China can be reduced by 
37% and 20%, respectively
There are also socio-economic benefits to increasing 
the use of renewables. According to IRENA estimates, 
about 6.5 million people were already employed in 
2013 in the renewable energy industry worldwide, of 
whom 2.6 million were in China (IRENA, 2014d). By 
2010, China had the largest number of people working 
in the solar PV sector, with 120 000 jobs. In the solar 
thermal sector the total number of people employed 
was between 250 000 and 600 000 in the period 
2006-2010. The biomass sector also provided about 
266 000 direct jobs.
The total number of jobs worldwide could reach 16 million (in cumulative job-years) by 2030 according to 
REmap 2030. This implies an equivalent of 0.9 million 
additional jobs which could be created in the global 
renewable energy sector (IRENA, 2014a). Given that 
a large share of the global renewable energy use estimated in 2030 would be in China, the country would 
benefit considerably from these additional jobs created. 
The REmap Options identified in China result in incremental system costs of USD 55-60 billion from a government perspective (Table 20). System cost calculations from a government perspective exclude energy 
taxes and subsidies, and use a standard 10% discount 
rate for capital investment. Incremental system costs 
do not include benefits related to reductions of air 
pollution (health) and CO2 emissions. If such externalities are included, and depending on how these are 
valued, full deployment of the REmap Options could 
result in estimated reduced health costs of USD 78-
162 billion per year by 2030. These avoided external 
costs result from a reduction of health complications 
due to air pollution from fossil power plants, indoor 
and outdoor air pollution from the traditional use of 
biomass and other solid fuels as well as fuels used in 
the transport sector.
If the benefits of the 1.7 Gt of reduced CO2 are taken 
into account, an additional USD 32-126 billion per 
year could be saved by 2030 (based on a carbon 
price of USD 20-80 per tonne CO2). The result of 
these externalities is a possible reduction in energy 
system costs of between USD 55 billion and USD 
228 billion per year. It is therefore possible to raise 
the renewable energy share with significant savings 
if externalities are included, and depending on how 
these are valued.
For example, today the damage to GDP related to 
acute mortality (from PM and sulphur dioxide) is 
equivalent to between 0.65% and 3.81% of China’s total 
GDP, with premature mortality of 62 000-125 000 per 
year. Chronic mortality related to particulate matter 
alone resulted in 561 000 cases of premature mortality 
annually with a total health damage to GDP of 4.36% 
(Ho and Nielsen, 2007). With total reductions in coal 
use of about 16 EJ (or a 18% reduction), total savings 
could be equivalent to 0.78% of GDP. This would mean

Total renewable energy investment needs (REmap Options and Reference Case) 145a total saving of up to USD 200 billion per year, assuming China’s total GDP doubles by 2030 to USD 25 
trillion.
Table 20 shows that the total investment needs of the 
REmap Options would be USD 54 billion per year. The 
table also shows that in addition to investment, an annual subsidy of USD 60 billion would be required to 
make REmap Options technologies with positive substitution costs “competitive” with fossil technologies. 
Technologies which require a subsidy lie mainly in the 
end-use sectors rather than power generation, namely 
for heating in buildings and industry (solar thermal) and 
electric vehicles.
This cost would likely be borne by consumers in the 
form of increased energy costs or taxes. It is important 
to note that by 2030 many renewable energy technologies should not require a subsidy, and should actually 
result in lower energy costs, so a better metric for energy prices might be the incremental system cost, which 
shows that energy prices would increase slightly.
7.5 Discussion of REmap 2030 
Options
Technology development challenges
Among the different REmap Options, four technologies 
need to grow substantially if the estimated potential of 
renewables in REmap 2030 are to be realised. Onshore 
wind power needs to grow by about 24 GWe/year, solar 
PV by about 17 GWe/year (40% of that related to rooftop installations) and solar thermal by about 48 GWth/
year (40% related to industrial process heat and other 
commercial applications). Given that there is very limited deployment of offshore wind today, development 
of 3 GWe/year is another substantial addition. Biomass 
as a source of energy for both the power and end-use 
sectors will also need to grow substantially and its traditional uses will need to be fully substituted according 
to REmap 2030.
While the growth rates envisioned are slightly higher 
than current trends, another major issue lies in expanding grid transmission capacity. This will require substantial investments. Estimates of other studies show that 
additional infrastructure related to the power sector 
(transmission, variable renewable energy measures) 
can add between 30% and 50% in addition to the total 
investment costs of power plants. Other grid constraints 
(e.g., institutional barriers, see Section 8) need to be 
resolved in the short-term as well to avoid today’s situation of capacity being installed but not necessarily connected to the grid.
In addition, inter-provincial transmission infrastructure 
needs to be built to allow power from the northern, 
northeastern and northwestern regions to be supplied 
to central and coastal demand areas. Inter-regional 
connections need to be strengthened and electricity 
trading markets will need to be developed. Some of 
the solar PV and wind development can be pushed to 
lower resource regions to ease the long-term challenge 
of building transmission grids. There will also be a focus 
on southwestern hydroelectricity in the future, given 
the distribution and development of water resources; 
however, here too there is a shortfall in planning for 
long-distance transmission lines. With regard to solar 
PV, the quality of equipment needs to be improved to 
ensure long project lifetimes.
In the case of offshore wind, the main challenge will be 
to increase connection to the mainland grid. China has 
limited experience in this area so far, particularly when 
it comes to connecting farms further from the shore. 
Hence, the challenge will be to develop solutions by 
2020 to cope with the potential growth in offshore wind 
such as the development of offshore substations and 
sub-sea cabling as well as improving gearbox reliability. 
In parallel, offshore wind-related equipment manufacturing output will need to grow to meet the growing 
demand (Carbontrust, 2014). Furthermore, China needs 
to focus on developing technologies that can deal with 
the corrosive effects of seawater on offshore installations as well as typhoon-resistant models.
In addition to technical challenges, costs may also be a 
problem for solar and wind since, as capacity increases, 
spatial constraints in certain regions may create issues. 
Hence today’s economically competitive locations may 
be less cost-effective in the longer term as their potential is realised.
As solar and wind capacity increases, the 
most favourable locations may become less 
cost-competitive due to spatial constraints
Solar thermal heat use in the building sector is already 
high in China and this is estimated to nearly quadruple by 2030, from 258 million m2 to 900 million m2. While 
this is already a challenge in its own right, the main effort will need to focus on deploying 600 million m2 solar 
thermal in the industrial (450 million m2) and commercial (150 million m2) sectors, where installed capacity 
today is nearly zero. Assuming 10 megawatts-thermal 
(MWth) of installed capacity per solar thermal facility, 
this would mean more than 30,000 manufacturing industry plants would be equipped with such technology.
China has a manufacturing industry that is diverse in 
terms of its energy demand and process heat temperature levels. Although much of industry comprises medium- and high-temperature sub-sectors such as cement, 
chemicals and iron and steel, many food processing 
and textile manufacturing plants exist which utilise low 
temperature heat. Given the highly cost-competitive 
solar thermal equipment available in China, such sectors 
can benefit from solar thermal if the right policies and 
targets are put in place for 2020 and 2030.
Bioenergy is estimated to have a potential across all sectors. However, the residential and industrial sectors pose 
particular challenges. In the residential sector, traditional 
uses of biomass are decreasing, and being substituted 
with modern forms of fossil fuels such as liquid petroleum gas (LPG). This change in fuel sources needs to be 
steered towards modern renewables, including modern 
forms of biomass. This requires the availability of reliable 
and affordable modern cook stoves. Earlier experiences 
showed that such equipment may not necessarily be 
accepted and used. Thus the challenge here concerns 
aspects of policy and public awareness as opposed to 
technical barriers.
Given the focus of China on non-food based liquid biofuels, the majority of production will need to be provided 
by advanced biofuel plants. So far production capacity 
is limited which means that substantial investments will 
be required to meet the potential demand. The capital 
costs of these plants are currently higher than conventional liquid biofuel plants. This capacity needs to be 
deployed already by 2020 to meet the assumptions of 
the Reference Case. Meeting all demand locally would 
require about 200 advanced biofuel plants, each with 
a total production capacity of 230 million litres ethanol 
per year.
The China biodiesel industry needs to compete for feedstock supply with gutter oil. According to Van Sambeek 
et al. (2013), 200-300 million tonnes of gutter oil is produced and sold back to market as edible oil each year.
As with solar thermal, biomass is not a fuel of choice 
for process heat generation in industry. However, a 
considerable share of up to 20% of the total demand 
from cement kilns, which comprise one of the largest 
manufacturing sectors in China, can be provided by 
biomass, waste and other fuels without any process 
modifications. In addition, biomass-fired CHP is an 
alternative to any fossil fuel-based heating systems and 
can be considered in investments for new production 
plants.
Water could be a major challenge with regard to a 
number of renewable energy technologies, in particular 
bioenergy and CSP, as is the case today for the coal 
supply chain. Among the different renewable power 
generation options, CSP is one of the most water 
intensive options. In particular, areas where CSP can 
be deployed (Qinghai, Gansu) are also arid. Water 
for bioenergy cultivation is another important 
consideration. Although the liquid biofuel market in 
China is not as developed as in the USA or India, about 
three-quarters of the total is assumed to originate 
from conventional feedstocks which also rely on water. 
For example, sorghum-based ethanol production is 
the most water-intensive route, followed by corn- and 
cassava-based ethanol.
Deployment of the full potential for biomass will depend 
on the availability of bioenergy supplies. In the high case 
of biomass supply, demand could utilise up to two-thirds 
of total available. But if supplies are limited, demand is 
likely to exceed the domestically available biomass in 
China. As part of the demand may need to be met from 
land- and fertiliser-dependent energy crops, improving 
yields and using marginal land will be important.
Focusing on the energy-land-water nexus and optimising the key routes will be very important if China is to 
realise its bioenergy potential. China also needs to start 
now on developing collection and logistics systems to 
increase the availability of scattered agricultural and 
forestry bioenergy to end-users. Conversion of feedstock to higher energy density biomass and related 
technologies (e.g., torrefaction) will gain importance. 
Another option to reduce increasing dependency on 
bioenergy will be to reduce total demand by improving 
energy efficiency.Overcoming these development challenges will require 
target setting, the development of finance mechanisms 
and in particular efforts to address transmission-related 
issues. China is currently putting much effort into these 
issues, but this effort needs to be sustained in the long 
term to 2030 and beyond.
The case for electrification
The analysis shows that biomass resources in China account for around 30% of the identified options in REmap 
2030. However, affordable and sustainable sourcing of 
biomass remains an important issue. The concurrent 
deployment of alternative and complementary renewable energy resources can help to reduce the potential 
dependence on biomass.
Electrification offers the potential to reduce fuel use 
for heating and transport. To further explore and clarify 
the renewable electricity potential, we have created an 
additional set of REmap options expressly for this case, 
Remap-E, which considers a more radical electrification 
scheme than REmap 2030. It essentially replaces most 
biomass and some fossil fuels with electricity from renewables. In REmap-E, we assume the deployment of 
three technology strategies to reduce biomass dependency and increase the share of electricity in end-use 
sectors. In the building sector, heat pumps deliver the 
required heat in the building and industry sectors instead of biomass (but only for low temperature heat). 
In the transport sector, modal shifts (public trams, 
electric buses and trains) can replace liquid biofuel use. 
Increased electricity demand from these end-use sectors would be supplied by additional solar PV and wind 
capacity.
A more radical electrification plan (REmap-E) 
could raise the share of renewables in 
power generation and total final energy 
consumption
In industry, the options for heating are limited, especially 
in the case of high-temperature process heat generation 
in the manufacturing sector, which can only be generated from biomass (or fossil fuels). However, for low and 
medium temperature applications, heat-pumps could 
be deployed. In the manufacturing industry an increase 
in electricity demand resulting from a switch from biomass fuels to heat-pumps results in around 470 TWh/
year of additional power demand.
For the transport sector, the additions in biofuel consumption identified in REmap 2030 are replaced by 
a shift from passenger automobile to electric public 
transport. For this around 20% of this passenger traffic 
is met by better utilisation of existing public transport 
lines, and the remaining 80% met through new electric 
transport infrastructure. In total 38 TWh of additional 
electricity is needed to power these electric transport 
systems.
In the power sector, there are plenty of alternatives to 
substitute biomass use in power production. In REmapE, 230 TWh of power production from biomass is 
reduced compared with REmap 2030, or a 66 TWh 
reduction over the 2030 Reference Case level. It was 
assumed that this reduction is met by increases in solar 
PV generation. Additionally, the increased electricity 
demand resulting from electrification in the end-use 
sectors of 415 TWh is met with 50% solar PV, 25% of 
onshore wind and 25% offshore wind.
Figure 23 compares the breakdown of the additions 
identified in the various REmap cases, as well as the 
renewable energy share in the energy mix of 2030: 
REmap 2030 and REmap-E and REmap-U, which shows 
how a 30% or great renewable energy share could be 
achieved on a global basis. Note that the share of renewables in TFEC would be slightly higher with electrification technologies replacing biomass, increasing from 
26% in REmap 2030 to 29% in REmap-E.
Biomass demand in China is assumed to increase in 
primary terms to 6.8 EJ by 2030 in REmap-E instead 
of 11.9 EJ in REmap 2030. This translates to almost no 
growth in biomass demand compared with today’s 
levels. Compared with REmap 2030, this is halving the 
demand for total biomass use.
The effect on the power sector in terms of installed 
capacity is dramatic. The total capacity of solar PV 
doubles from just over 300 GWe REmap 2030 to over 
600 GWe in REmap-E. For wind, including both offshore 
and onshore, around 100 GWe of additional capacity is added, resulting in around 630 GWe in REmap-E. 
Biomass power capacity decreases to about 25 GWe, or 
around two-thirds the 2010 level. The share of renewable energy in power increases from 39% in REmap 2030, to 43% in REmap-E. These have the effect of raising the share of variable renewables in generation from 
19% in REmap 2030 to 26% in REmap-E, implying that 
even more efforts will be required to ensure grid stability compared with the REmap 2030 case.
Another important finding is that REmap-E results in 
a lower TFEC in 2030 of 83 EJ compared with 90 EJ 
in REmap 2030, a saving of 8%. The main reason is the 
higher energy efficiency of electrification technologies 
over combustion energy systems when viewed in final 
energy terms. As a result, even with a smaller increase in 
EJ from the REmap Options in REmap-E, a similar share 
of renewables can be achieved as in REmap 2030.
Another strategy for doubling the global renewable 
energy share is represented by the case of REmap-U 
(also shown in Figure 23). In this case, all countries are 
assumed to reach at least 36% renewable energy share 
by 2030 regardless of where they stand today, using a 
generic mix of different renewable energy technologies. 
While some countries would need to substantially increase their renewable energy shares from today’s very 
low levels to 30%, others would meet, or even surpass, 
this level according to their Reference Case developments.
A number of technology options and strategies are 
required to ensure that all countries reach at least 30% 
by 2030. According to REmap-U, the first strategy for all 
countries is to reduce energy demand by implementing 
energy efficiency measures. The reduction potential 
would differ for each country, varying with the growth 
of energy consumption and the current level and disFigure 23: Renewable energy technology options in the cases of REmap 2030, REmap-E and REmap-U, 2030

Note: All cases result in a reduction of traditional uses of biomass and REmap-E results in a reduction of biomass use for power generation, 
these are shown with the negative values in the graphtribution of energy intensity. For China an energy efficiency improvement of 5% was assumed.
The second strategy involves using increased electrification technologies for countries that do not achieve a 
30% renewable energy share after the REmap Options 
and energy efficiency improvements are considered. 
This includes China, which only achieves slightly more 
than 28% in REmap-U when only energy efficiency 
improvements are taken into account. The electrification technologies chosen for China are those used 
in REmap-E, with the exception of industry relocation, which is not considered. As shown in Figure 23, 
REmap-U takes China’s renewables share to 32%.
There are increased costs associated with both of these 
cases. These increased costs are in addition to the substitution cost already incurred when deploying biomass

to around USD 10 per GJ for the impacted technologies. 
In industry the use of heat pumps adds around USD 2 
per GJ to the substitution cost. For REmap-U, similar 
costs are associated with increased electrification, the 
assumed energy efficiency improvements yielding cost 
savings since less renewable energy capacity is required. As a result, the cost impact of REmap-U is lower 
than REmap-E.
Comparisons with other studies
Figure 24 provides a comparison of the REmap 2030 
findings for the power sector with those of a number of 
other scenario studies. The most ambitious renewable 
energy scenario has been chosen from these studies for 
comparison with the REmap 2030.
IRENA’s total power generation estimates of 9 595 
TWh/year are in the middle of the range found by other 
studies, which span from about 8 000 TWh/year to 
11 000 TWh/year in 2030. In terms of the renewable energy share in power generation, REmap 2030 estimates 
are 5-15  percentage points lower than others. This is 
partly due to higher forecasts for coal-based power 
generation of around 4 300 TWh/year in REmap 2030, 
compared with between 2 600 TWh and 3 400 TWh/
year in other studies.
Hydroelectricity generation is among the highest in 
REmap 2030, with about 1 600 TWh/year compared 
with total installed capacity of around 400 GWe in most 
other studies. The difference is explained by the higher 
capacity factors of 4 000 hours assumed in REmap 
2030.
Total power generation from wind of 1 300 TWh/year is 
lower than other studies. With regard to biomass and 
geothermal power generation, REmap 2030 is comparable to projections in other studies. Greenpeace (2012) 
projects much higher generation for offshore wind, 
geothermal and ocean technologies compared with any 
other studies.
A comprehensive review of various modelling tools 
looking into China’s energy future has been carried out 
by Mischke and Karlsson (2014). According to the review 
of 10 energy models, the total energy demand of China 
could grow by anywhere between 50% and 125% by 
2030 compared with 2010 levels. In the Reference Case 
of this study, total final energy consumption grows by 
about 60%, which falls in the middle of this range.
Forecasts of China’s energy demand growth 
by 2030 vary widely; projections in the 
Reference Case of this study fall in the middle 
of the range8.1 Barriers and opportunities in 
the power sector
Conventional fuels
As a result of its coal dependence and size of the economy, China has the highest CO2 emissions of all countries. 
Moreover China currently accounts for 70% of new CO2
emissions each year. Burning coal also results in massive 
local and regional air pollution problems. The record air 
pollution in January 2013 resulted in increased efforts to 
limit coal use, especially in the populated and industrial 
areas of eastern China. The government has recognised 
these environmental problems and is trying to diversify 
its energy mix.
Around 95% of the total power generation capacity 
in China has been built since 1990 and will still be operational in 2030. Therefore replacement investments 
play a secondary role in the transition to renewables 
unless the costly early retirement of some coal-fired 
plants is considered, as has been addressed in the case 
of onshore wind power in this study. However, demand 
growth is projected to continue and double between 
2010 and 2030. This translates to about 1 000 GWe of future coal power generation capacity. Overall, more than 
500 GW of capacity additions are planned of which 70% 
are coal-based (Platts, 2013).
Transmission and grid infrastructure
The distribution of energy resources in China is diverse. 
More than 80% of the potential energy resources, such 
as coal, oil, natural gas, hydroelectricity, wind power and 
solar energy, are distributed in the northern and western 
parts of China. Around 80% of onshore wind energy 
capacity is distributed in the “3-North” regions (North, 
Northeast and Northwest). Two-thirds of hydroelectricity is located in the southeast. The spatial distribution 
of supply and demand creates challenges. Significant 
transmission capacity is planned, but not yet in place. 
Moreover, renewable power competes with coal power 
for the same transmission capacity.
By contrast, 70% of the total demand is in central and 
coastal parts of China (Hammons, 2011). The distance 
between the best resources for renewable energy generation and the main areas of demand is a major obstacle because of the large investment needs for new 
transmission and distribution capacity.
This has already constrained the rapid expansion of 
renewables. There is a considerable lag between additions in wind power capacity and the proportion that 
has been connected to the grid (DB, 2012; Zhang et al., 
2014). In 2012, 22% of installed wind power was running idle, mainly due to the fact that coal-fired power 
plants have, in practice, priority grid access and grid 
capacity is limited. As of the same year, 20% of China’s 
wind farms were not connected to a power grid. This is 
caused by a combination of factors that include, rapid 
capacity expansion, limited coordination between project developers and grid planners, lack of transmission 
capacity and technical concerns of regional utilities that 
the intermittency of wind power could be disruptive to 
normal operations19 (Zhang et al., 2014).
Restrictions to inter-regional grid connections mean 
that cross-regional trade represented 4% of total production in 2009. Much of this is due to the fact that coal 
power plants still have priority (IEA, 2011b; Davidson, 
2013b). The effect might be small in Liaoning, Ninxiang, 
Yunnan and Xinjiang but it falls 1-3 percentage points 
off capacity factors in Jilin, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, 
Heilongjiang and Hebei. The effective capacity factor 
of Chinese wind is 22-23%, compared with 31-32% for 
the United States (2013 data). Curtailment rates ranged 
from 13% to 25% in 2012, although these restrictions are 
falling. Between January and June 2014, the nationwide curtailment rate was 8.5%. According to China’s 
renewable energy policy, wind farm owners should be 
compensated for curtailment, but in reality no economic 
compensation is paid.
19 Different accounting systems for annual wind market statistics 
have led to different information about the status of wind farm 
connection to the grid; thus different values are found in the literature.
8 BARRIERS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR 
RENEWABLE ENERGY TRANSITIONGrid is a key enabler and the future of wind energy is 
closely connected to the future development of grid 
policies. So far, high curtailment rates related to problems with grid connections, the lack of priority dispatch 
and missing power grid capacity have led to uncertainty and financial losses. In 2013, wind saw a capacity increase, possibly as a result of improved measures 
to reduce curtailment. In addition to curtailment, the 
second other big system challenge which China’s wind 
sector is facing today is grid interconnection, but China 
made considerable progress related to that as well since 
both new installations grew and the percentage of nonconnected capacity fell.
With regard to solar PV, curtailment in the first half of 
2014 reached up to 30% for many plants, and in particular in provinces where solar PV capacity is high. Some 
70-80% of the overall capacity comprised utility-scale 
plants facing significant grid curtailment constraints 
(notably in the northern and northwestern regions).
Despite the improvements in wind power, a number 
of institutional barriers continue to stand against increased transmission. These include disagreements on 
the engineering and economic merits of AC vs DC lines, 
fragmented transmission authorities (implying the need 
for centralisation of dispatch and transmission), and 
non-market and semi-transparent transmission pricing 
(Davidson, 2013b).
Each of the three independent grid companies in 
China, namely SGCC, China State Grid Corporation 
(CSGC) and the Western Inner Mongolia Grid 
Corporation, is responsible for its own profit and loss. 
This limits incentives for inter-company co-operation. 
Furthermore, the current electricity trading structure 
is an obstacle. Without changes to the current system, 
the expansion of grid transmission capacity may not 
be a solution. Spot market electricity trading is small 
(14% of the total power generated in 2009); otherwise 
inter-regional and provincial trading is determined by 
multi-year contracts, both in terms of the volume and 
price (IEA, 2011b).
Solar photovoltaics
China had 21 GWe of solar capacity installed as of the 
end of 2013. In the same year, a distributed FiT was 
introduced. For solar PV, the deployment strategy has 
changed in recent years. Before 2013, the focus was 
on large-scale solar PV installations. There has been 
movement on this front and since then the focus has 
begun to shift towards distributed solar PV applications. 
NEA recently approved 1.8 GWe of distributed industrial/
commercial solar PV demonstration projects, and more 
than 3 GWe of capacity was commissioned in the first 
half of 2014, with cumulative distributed PV capacity 
reaching 4 GWe by the end of June 2014 (CREIA, 2014b). 
This is a considerable increase compared to end of 2013 
where only 800 MWe capacity was installed. But current 
solar PV leasing models have encountered a number 
of issues related to uncertainties about ownership of a 
property over the contract period. Such uncertainties 
could put developers into a situation where the contract 
might not be respected if the business owner has 
changed. Moreover, although the saved tariff and 
received subsidies should be shared between the 
developer and roof owners, the developers might face 
difficulties in receiving their share timely or fully as 
agreed in the contract.
Execution of projects has so far also been hampered 
by a number of other factors. These include financial 
returns determined by FiTs which are less attractive as 
current policy prefers a 100% self-generation and selfconsumption model instead of selling self-generated 
power to the grid. In addition, multi-point grid connections are not allowed, while residential power prices are 
Box 6: Inner Mongolia case study: The need for connection
In 2010, Inner Mongolia had total power generation capacity of 34 GWe. In comparison, demand is only 18 GWe. 
Of the remaining 16 GWe, only 4 GWe can be exported to the northern China grid. This means there is an 
overcapacity of 12 GWe. This problem will grow as more wind farms are built. In the 12th FYP, Inner Mongolia 
requested the following grid expansion: seven 600 kV AC lines, one 660 kV DC line, and one 800 kV Ultra 
High Voltage Direct Current (UHVDC) line which can bundle hydro, thermal and wind power and transmit 
30 GWe outside of the province (Lu, 2010).much lower than the industrial and commercial rates. 
This makes residential schemes comparatively unattractive: there is an unguaranteed stability of the load, 
and as discussed above no standardised roof leasing 
contracts are available, and the ownership and poor 
structural stability of roofs is often unclear. All of these 
risks help to limit the confidence of banks in providing 
loans to distributed solar PV investors. Quality of equipment (affecting lifetime, return on investments, etc.) 
and standards are also key issues.
To address these issues, Chinese authorities released a 
number of policy updates in September 2014 to ensure 
that the installation target of 8 GWe of distributed generation can be reached.
Standardised grid connection regulation for solar PV 
electricity generators with a capacity below 2.5 MWe
can guarantee private investors access, connection and 
priority dispatch for the distribution grid one month 
after the completion of construction. In combination 
with standardised building regulation, this should help 
to achieve the 2020 distributed solar PV targets. Public 
buildings might get permission to lease rooftops to investors, benefiting both parties.
Wind offshore
While offshore wind today is more expensive in China 
than onshore wind, it is a technology of high strategic 
importance. The cost reduction potential for offshore 
wind installations is significant. The majority of China´s 
mega cities are close to its long coastline and relatively 
short distances for new power lines are required to connect offshore wind farms with cities and industrial areas. 
However, current offshore wind targets are low and a 
mid-term programme to accelerate installation rates 
would help to boost the industry.
Bioenergy
Bioenergy for power generation is a mature market, but 
today feedstock collection and the unstable prices of 
feedstock are major problems to its deployment. Residues have a large potential, but agricultural production 
is mostly small-scale and geographically scattered. Supply chains are not yet established to collect and deliver 
the required quantities to end-users. Despite the large 
availability of straw, for example, its harvest period is 
short (six weeks), meaning large-scale storage is required, as are distribution networks to make the most 
of the resource.
As a result, the growth of biomass power generation 
capacity has been very moderate. Waste-to-energy 
technologies exist, but problems arise over the pricing 
of waste treatment services and the allocation of energy 
recovery benefits. Related environmental impacts are 
another issue limiting the further use of waste for power 
generation.
Feed-in Tariffs
China has chosen to use FiTs to support the deployment 
of renewable energy. So far the experience has been 
good in general, despite problems with long delays in 
reimbursing producers. But the total costs of the FiT 
system are growing rapidly and the Chinese government aims to gradually reduce the amount of tariff 
spending with the aim of stopping FiTs for new installations by 2020. A smooth transition is required in order 
to secure the future development and growth of the 
renewable energy industry. Parallel to the phasing out 
of FiTs, the current “FiT” – a guaranteed price per MWh 
which is set by the NDRC for thermal plants – should be 
phased out at the same time in order to achieve a level 
playing field.
It is not only the FiTs, but grid regulations which could 
be the backbone of the renewable energy sector in the 
future. If that would be the case, renewable energy sector will need more regulatory support after 2025 and 
less monetary support. Priority dispatch and mandatory 
grid connections will be key policy instruments as they 
are expected to enter full competitiveness with conventional power generation technologies between 2020 
and 2025. A minimum tariff for all renewable energy 
generators – based on the annual average generation 
costs of the previous year – could remain as a fall-backoption in order to lower the risk to investors.
Renewable energy equipment manufacture
China has a large wind turbine and solar PV production 
capacity. The massive scale-up of solar PV production 
in the country has contributed significantly to the rapid 
decrease of solar PV investment costs. Some two-thirds 
of all solar water heaters and 90% of biogas installations 
are also located in China. A combination of market size, 
industrial capacity and the application of policies to specific areas of renewable energy use has enabled this 
development.
While it may not be the case today, China might face 
several challenges to developing its renewable energy 
industry further over the coming decades, including 
the increasing export orientation of the wind industry 
and increased imports related to the domestic solar PV 
market. Targets for equipment manufacturing capacities 
(solar PV and wind) in terms of GW/year, which take into 
account the medium and long-term goals for the domestic market, require re-powering needs. The overall 
assumed development of the global market size could 
be useful in this respect. Long-term certainty helps to 
achieve cost stability for renewable energy policies as 
well.
Improving the quality of products is important for a 
number of reasons. Better products enhance the lifetime and durability of plants, thereby ensuring a higher 
return on investments. As a consequence, this creates 
more confidence for both investors and financiers. Furthermore, there is a need for continuous innovation and 
R&D to improve the efficiency of plants.
8.2 Power market reform
Power market reforms have been on the Chinese government’s agenda since 2002, and several local tests 
have been conducted. On the national level, however, 
there is only limited progress. Power market reforms on 
the wholesale and retail side are closely linked to power 
sector restructuring with more transparent pricing of 
grid services and clearer division of roles regarding grid 
development and system operation.
In essence, the power sector can be broken down 
into three independent areas: power production, 
transmission and distribution. Transparent regulation 
for grid access, grid services and dispatch and wheeling 
fees/regulations enable private and public investors to 
enter the power market. Unbundling the sector from a 
transmission grid operator (TSO) and distribution grid 
operator (DSO) is possible both with private and stateowned ownership structures. Liberalisation of the power 
sector in Europe over the past 20 years has shown that 
state-owned grids can still provide access to private 
investors.
Each entity must be independent, with a legal framework which guarantees a level playing field without the 
discrimination of third parties. The lack of progress in 
that regard creates challenges for the renewable energy 
sector.
Firstly, delays in power sector reform create serious 
problems for the integration of renewable energy. The 
state-owned power generation companies have their 
power production prices set by the government; operating hours are set on a yearly basis for coal plants that 
represent the bulk of generation capacity. This makes it 
difficult to ensure that the electricity system is efficient. 
The power uptake of renewables is regulated through 
state-regulated hydro expansion and portfolio standards combined with FiT for solar, wind and bioenergy, 
and it has been difficult to coordinate the deployment 
of these technologies with plans for local grid development.
8.3 Barriers and opportunities in 
end-use sectors
In 2030, power consumption would only account for 
30% of China’s total final energy consumption. 70% 
would be related to fuel use in end-use sectors for heating and transport. This means efforts in end-use sectors 
to overcome related barriers, thereby accelerating the 
use of renewables will be essential.
Heating demand can be divided into four components. 
Heating in buildings is for cooking as well as space and 
water. In the manufacturing industry, it is process heat 
for production in the form of steam, hot water or direct 
use.
So far, most policy attention has been related to improving efficiency, but some renewable technologies 
achieved considerable success. Today there is a support programme which covers both urban and rural 
consumers regarding the increased use of solar thermal 
for water heating. However, its capacity in the industry 
sector is negligible. Biomass also plays a negligible role 
in industry, with the exception of some non-metallic 
mineral production processes that use charcoal or briquettes as well as the use of black liquor in the pulp and 
paper industry. There is no policy focus to accelerate the 
use of renewables in the sector.District heating plays an important role in urban areas 
of northern China. The heat is however predominately 
produced from coal-fired CHP. Biomass-fired district 
heat generation and other non-biomass renewables are 
alternatives. Some of the solar heating and geothermal 
related targets of the 12th FYP may create synergies for 
the district heat sector. To date, there are a number of 
solar thermal pilot projects for district heat generation.
China’s biogas programme has resulted in the rapid 
expansion of biogas digesters; today around 100 million 
rural people benefit from such systems. In view of the 
changing socio-economic landscape (e.g., decreasing 
rural population), policies need to be adapted to ensure 
continuity in growing biogas use.
One of the key challenges in the residential sector is the 
traditional use of biomass. The first priority is improving 
knowledge about the actual use of traditional biomass, 
hence measuring current demand. There is a wide 
range in statistics about the number of people relying 
on biomass for cooking in rural areas. The Chinese government provided 180 million improved cooking stoves 
to households across the country that use biomass, 
however, their status is unknown. Without better data, 
it is not possible to set targets and develop policies. 
The second priority is to create a market for efficient, 
reliable and affordable cooking stoves and ensure their 
acceptability.
In order to draw up appropriate policies 
for traditional biomass use, the priority is 
to acquire better data on the sector and 
measure current demand
For the transport sector, the policy focus is on improving 
efficiency through fuel economy standards, labelling, 
improving the quality of fuels, as well as subsidies and 
taxation of vehicle and fuels. There are subsidies which 
are specific to electric vehicles, the amounts depending 
on the vehicle type and battery capacity. Regarding 
biofuels, targets exist for 2020, and the government 
encourages the use of marginal land and non-food 
feedstock for their production. However, mandates and 
market support for ethanol only covers nine provinces 
so far and the government does not support and/or 
incentivise specific biodiesel mechanisms.9 SUGGESTIONS FOR ACCELERATED 
RENEWABLE ENERGY UPTAKE
The development and use of renewable energy is a high 
priority for China in order to address growing environmental challenges and the need to enhance the security 
of energy supply. Reaching higher shares of renewable 
energy use also has an important role to play in meeting China’s policy objectives in respect to job creation, 
new economic activity and a better trade balance. In the 
beginning of the 2000s, China decided to boost the development of renewable energy through energy policies 
as well as industry policy measures. As a result, China is 
today a global leader in renewable energy.
This study showed that there is a potential to increase 
this growth further which can lead to 26% renewable 
energy share in China’s total energy mix. At the same 
time, there remains a number of challenge and barriers 
which must be overcome to realise this potential. Based 
on the discussion in this study, the following high level 
policy recommendations have been identified to help 
accelerate the deployment of modern renewables in 
China from 2010 to 2030 and to account for some of the 
requirements during the transition period:
Renewable energy policy:
● Develop a comprehensive national energy plan 
that accounts for the needed infrastructure for 
transmission and distribution of electricity, heat 
and gas
● Introduce taxation, caps, and/or CO2 trading systems to account for the damage of CO2 emission 
and other air pollution from coal combustion
● Assess the socio-economic, energy security, 
health, land and water use impact of various 
technologies
● Set targets for renewables in manufacturing, 
buildings and transport
Power market design:
● Establish national power market, creating incentives for flexible operation, and bringing in new 
investors
● Develop the grid to better integrate renewable 
energy, enhance trade and deal with variability
Technology focused policies:
● Enhance government support for innovation, 
research and development to reduce renewable 
energy costs
● Support development of next-generation renewable energy technologies
● Improve knowledge and data collection on biomass and develop a working biomass feedstock 
market
In addition to these high-level policy recommendations, 
the rest of this section provides more detailed recommendations grouped under five areas of policy action. 
These recommendations emerge from the outcomes 
of the China REmap 2030 analysis. The policy action 
areas are defined based on IRENA’s country analysis in 
consultation with the national experts.
Planning transition pathways:
— Diversify technology deployment to include options which are being deployed slowly today, 
including offshore wind, CSP, large biogas and 
waste to energy
— Target cost reductions and power system market 
re-design for the short term, and integration of 
large shares of renewables into the system for 
the long term
— Ensure grid development as part of the development strategy for renewables
— Cooperate with neighbouring countries in grid 
integration to allow renewable electricity trade (e.g., wind and solar with Mongolia, hydro with 
Siberia and South East Asia)
— Continue to focus on renewable energy use for 
end-use sectors, and expand target setting
Creating an enabling business environment:
— Allow prices to reflect the marginal cost realistically (i.e., spot markets, day/hour ahead markets)
— Continue using subsidy schemes until technologies reach a mature level, in a way that supports 
cost reduction and efficient use of renewable 
energy
— Revise renewable power subsidies to enhance effectiveness by rewarding both construction and 
operation, reach power generators in a timely 
manner, and avoid delays in reimbursements
Ensuring smooth integration of renewables 
into the system:
— Ensure economic incentives for flexible operation 
of thermal power plants and grids
— Develop solutions for pumped hydro business as 
part of the power sector market reform
— Strengthen decentralised solutions, notably for 
rooftop solar PV, including leasing models and 
policies such as net metering and smart grids
— Improve planning and organisation to stabilise 
biomass feedstock supply and improve feedstock 
logistics
— Improve planning for effective utilisation of straw 
residues as an energy source
Creating and managing knowledge:
— Support the building of qualified human and 
institutional capacity for deployment of renewables and related infrastructure
— Improve data collection as well as the quality of 
biomass statistics (modern, traditional)
— Increase the availability of provincial level data 
and improve access to data through the internet 
for load and production of electricity and heat
Unleashing innovation:
— Assess best practice technology and policies 
abroad and evaluate their applicability to China 
conditions
— Consider biomass co-firing and waste use in 
coal-fired power plants and co-combustion in 
cement kilns
— Refurbish small-hydroelectricity dams with a 
view to increase efficiency of power generation
— Explore options for advanced biofuels from lignocellulosic feedstock, and develop innovative 
solutions for energy-intensive industries that account for large industrial energy use share
— Develop solar heat for industrial process heat 
generation and solar absorption cooling for commercial buildings
— Strengthen electric vehicle and modal-shift programmes in tandem with an increasingly large 
share of renewables in power generation
— Strengthen renewable energy use in newly constructed buildings in cities3TIER (2009), “Inc. Global Wind Dataset: Annual Mean 
Validation”, October 2009, Presented via IRENA’s Global 
Atlas platform.

Municipal waste 1.2Two examples are provided to explain how the substitution costs are estimated:
● Biomass boiler substituting LPG-based boiler: 
The difference between the annualised capital, 
operation and maintenance and energy costs 
of the two boiler systems to deliver the same 
amount of heat are estimated, thereby taking 
into account the conversion efficiency, size of 
capacity, lifetime, capacity factors, etc. This is 
divided by the total final biomass demand of the 
boiler required to deliver that heat.
● Wind power substituting existing coal-based 
power: The difference between the annualised 
capital, operation and maintenance and energy 
costs of the two power systems to deliver the 
same amount of electricity are estimated, thereby taking into account the conversion efficiency, 
size of capacity, lifetime, capacity factors, etc. In 
the case of existing coal-based power, there are 
no capital costs as the capacity is assumed to be 
depreciated already. This difference is divided by 
the total renewable electricity generated from 
the wind power capacity.
For the business case, energy prices were estimated 
based on a number of methods. For some multipliers, 
expected developments in energy prices for the period 
between 2010 and 2030 were used based on the IEA 
projections and these were applied to national 2010 
prices (IEA, 2012a). For the case of coal, import prices 
were used; for natural gas, Asian regional import prices 
were used; for oil products, IEA crude oil import price 
projections were used. For conventional liquid biofuel 
prices, growth in price was matched to expected development in petroleum prices; advanced biofuel estimates 
originated from IRENA’s own estimates. All biomass 
feedstock prices are based on IRENA bottom-up analysis (IRENA, 2014c). Electricity prices were assumed to 
increase 30% over 2010 levels, which is based on the 
average price increase of conventional energy carriers, 
but also taking into account the changes in the fuel mix 
of the power sector with renewables.
In the government case, for coal, China was assumed to 
largely remain a domestic producer, therefore the lower 
price option was used. Electricity prices are based on 
national prices as described in the business case, but 
with the effect of taxes removed. For natural gas China 
was assumed to be an importer of natural gas and the 
higher price was used. Natural gas and coal prices were 
based on import/export price estimates from the IEA 
(2012a). Petroleum prices are standardised for the world 
and indexed to expected developments in the price of 
crude oil based on IEA (2012a). Liquid biofuel prices are 
IRENA estimates with the effect of taxes or subsidies 
removed. Biomass fuel prices are regionalised to the 
Asia (non-OECD) region.

Total demand 12004ANNEX I:
Traditional use of biomass in China
While studies provide indications of the total population 
relying on biomass in China, it is not entirely clear how 
much traditional biomass is actually used according to 
the energy statistics available.
There are, however, a number of organisations which 
look into the total biomass demand by sector. The time 
series for the years between 1990 and 2013 based on 
the IEA (2013a), LBNL (2013) and FAOSTAT (2014) are 
provided in Figure 29. The main findings based on these 
three sources are discussed below:
(i) According to the IEA (2013a), in 2011 the residential sector used around 8 EJ of solid biomass; 
this was followed by the power generation sector where demand was 0.45 EJ. The residential 
sector also used a total of 0.3 EJ of biogas. Solid 
biomass use in the residential sector is decreasing whereas the demand for other applications 
is increasing. From these statistics it is not clear 
which part of the total solid biomass use in the 
residential sector is actually traditional. According to the IEA definition, all biomass use in the 
residential sector of the non-OECD countries 
should be traditional unless otherwise stated. 
If this definition is followed, the total traditional 
use of biomass in China in 2011 was 8 EJ. The IEA 
states in its methodology that data collected for 
biofuels and waste are estimates based on per 
capita average consumption according to various 
surveys and studies.
(ii) The FAO provides figures for fuel wood production and trade statistics by country. According 
to the organisation, the total fuel wood consumed (equivalent to production) in China has 
decreased from 3 EJ in 1990 to 1.9 EJ in 2010 
(FAOSTAT, 2014)20. This decrease is a strong indication that much of this demand is related to 
20 The FAO reports wood fuel used in traditional form separately, if 
countries report the related quantities. This was not the case in 
China.
traditional uses of biomass in rural areas since an 
increasing share of China’s population is moving 
to urban areas; in addition, fuel mix changes in 
the residential sector are increasing the availability of LPG from urban to rural areas. According 
to the FAO, fuel wood includes all demand for 
power generation, heating and cooking. Excluding biomass demand related to power generation, we estimate the total wood fuel used for 
heating and cooking in the residential sector to 
be 1.6 EJ in 2011. However, it is not possible to provide a further breakdown about how much of the 
demand is traditional and how much is modern.
(iii) Another source which provides bioenergy use 
data is the LBNL China Energy Databook (LBNL, 
2013). This source provides a breakdown of bioenergy use for three types of biomass, namely crop stalk, firewood and biogas. The source 
states that biomass data for rural household 
consumption should be treated with caution, 
saying that “…since sources vary, official estimates of biomass use for various years may not 
be comparable”21. According to LBNL, in 2007 
the total demand for solid biomass had reached 
7.4 EJ, which is similar to what is reported by the 
IEA (2013a) for the residential sector in the same 
year. Biogas data is identical to the IEA statistics. 
Crop stalks (5.2 EJ) accounted for two-thirds of 
the total demand for rural biomass household 
consumption with the remaining third coming 
from firewood (2.8 EJ) in 2007. Firewood data 
provided by the LBNL databook show strong 
similarities with the fuel wood data from the FAO.
In addition to these energy statistics, a number of other 
studies provide estimates for the total use of traditional 
biomass in the rural residential sector. According to 
Chen, Yao and Li (2010), rural residential energy con21 The following sources have been quoted for the energy data in the 
statistics: EB, National Rural Energy Planning, 1990; SPC, Energy 
Conservation in China, 1997; NBS, China Energy Statistical Yearbook, various years; NBS, China Statistical Yearbook, various years; 
EB, China Rural Energy Statistical Yearbook, 1998-1999.sumption has shown a considerable shift from traditional to modern biomass use. The share of traditional 
biomass decreased from 82% in 2001 to 71% in 2008 
of the total non-commercial energy use. The absolute 
volume of traditional use of biomass is shown in Table 
18. In 2008, about 5.1 EJ of traditional biomass was used 
in China, according to the study. This is much lower than 
the data provided by the IEA statistics and LBNL databook, but higher than the values according to the FAO.
Xia (2013) reports that rural biomass energy use for the 
residential sector in China in 2011 was 127 million tonnes 
of coal equivalent, or 3.7 EJ per year.
Another source of data is the CNREC, which provides a 
breakdown of total biomass demand for power generation, as briquettes in heating, biogas and finally liquid 
biofuels. According to the CNREC, total demand for 
biomass was 0.7 EJ and 1 EJ per year in 2010 and 2012, 
respectively. CNREC data for power generation, liquid 
biofuels and biogas are very similar to the values according to the IEA statistics and the LBNL databook. 
However, data for solid biomass (88 PJ) is much lower 
than what is reported by other sources.
According to Mainali, Pachauri and Nagai (2012), household energy consumption in China ranged between 
3.1 GJ and 10 GJ per capita per year (GJ/cap/year) in 
2005. About 2-4 GJ/cap/year was related to biomass 
for cooking and heating. Based on a total rural population of about 670 million people, the study estimates total biomass demand for cooking was 2.1 EJ/year in 2005.
According to the data provided by Zhou, McNeil and 
Levine (2009), we estimate the total per capita energy 
demand in China for cooking and space/water heatFigure 28: Comparison of China total biomass use based on different sources, 1990-2013

heating and the other half is split between 80% space 
heating and 20% cooking.
Other studies also provide values for similar indicators. 
According to Daioglou, van Ruijven and van Vuuren 
(2012), total annual rural energy use per capita in 2007 
was 12 GJ. Of this total, about 8.5 GJ/cap/year was related to cooking and 3 GJ/cap/year was related to space 
and water heating, of which space heating accounted 
for a considerably larger share.
Based on these per capita demand estimates and depending on the share of the total rural population relying on traditional uses of biomass, total demand in 2010 
would be 0.8-4.2 EJ in China.P.O. Box 236, Abu Dhabi
