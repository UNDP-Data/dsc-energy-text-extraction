About RRA
A Renewables Readiness Assessment (RRA) is a holistic evaluation of a country’s conditions and 
identifies the actions needed to overcome barriers to renewable energy deployment. This is a 
country-led process, with IRENA primarily providing technical support and expertise to facilitate 
consultations among different national stakeholders. While the RRA helps to shape appropriate 
policy and regulatory choices, each country determines which renewable energy sources and 
technologies are relevant and consistent with national priorities. The RRA is a dynamic process 
that can be adapted to each country’s circumstances and needs. Experience in a growing 
range of countries and regions, meanwhile, has allowed IRENA to continue refining the basic RRA 
methodology. In June 2013, IRENA published a guide for countries seeking to conduct the process 
in order to accelerate their renewable energy deployment.

RENEWABLES READINESS 
ASSESSMENT 2013FOREWORD
Zambia joins the rest of the developing world, and in particular Africa, 
in taking advantage of the benefits that renewable energy can bring in 
contributing to sustainable economic growth. Zambia is also aware of how 
renewable energy can assist in achieving the Millennium Development 
Goals by ensuring access to modern energy services for the majority 
of the rural communities. In particular, small-scale renewable energy 
systems can provide affordable energy to the poor, help with creating 
employment by powering enterprises for increased production, and 
produce cleaner energy for cooking and heating.
The Government of the Republic of Zambia established the Rural 
Electrification Authority (REA) and the Rural Electrification Fund through 
the Rural Electrification Act (No. 20 of 2003), in order to give impetus to the 
rural electrification agenda. The Rural Electrification Authority strives to 
fulfil its vision, “Electricity for all rural areas by the Year 2030”, by designing 
and offering smart subsidies for capital costs, to developers and operators 
that are selected on a competitive basis, for projects to supply energy for 
the development of rural areas. 
The government has also formulated a Draft Renewable Energy Strategy, 
which outlines key strategic goals and objectives for each renewable 
energy source, along with the plans to be implemented to achieve these. 
The policy of greater utilisation of renewable energy will be realised by 
setting targets and strengthening Zambia’s policy, legal and institutional 
framework.Zambia is grateful to the International Renewable Energy Agency 
(IRENA) for being selected as a participating country for the Renewable 
Readiness Assessment (RRA) Process. The actions identified in the RRA 
process will help us to strengthen our investment framework, create 
a renewable-friendly institutional and regulatory framework, support 
techno-economic assessments of renewable energy systems, and 
develop a biofuels framework, all of which will go a long way in assisting 
us with the implementation of the Draft Renewable Energy Strategy for 
Zambia.
Zambia fully supports the mandate of IRENA to promote the deployment of renewable energy worldwide. We also fully endorse the RRA 
process, which creates a solid foundation for enhancing the contribution 
of renewable energy to social and economic development, not only for 
Zambia but for the rest of Africa as well.
Hon. Christopher B. Yaluma, MP
Minister of Mines, Energy 
and Water Development,
ZambiaFOREWORD
The Africa High-level Consultative Forum held by the International 
Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) in July 2011 highlighted the need 
for technical support for African countries and regions to identify their 
renewable-energy readiness. The Renewables Readiness Assessment 
(RRA) process stemming from this involves a holistic evaluation of a 
country’s conditions and identifies the actions needed to overcome 
barriers to renewable energy deployment. This is a country-led process, 
with IRENA primarily providing technical support and expertise to 
facilitate consultations among different national stakeholders. 
Since 2011, more than 14 countries in Africa, the Middle East, Latin 
America and the Caribbean, Asia and the Pacific Islands have undertaken 
the RRA process, which generates knowledge of good practices and 
supports international cooperation to enable accelerated deployment 
of renewable technologies. Zambia, in keeping with its strong and 
consistent support of IRENA’s mission, is one of those ground-breaking 
countries. 
RRA consultations have highlighted the opportunity for Zambia to 
develop sustainable biofuels for export; the need for an integrated 
resource plan for power generation; and the capacities that must be 
built up to expand rural off-grid electricity services. IRENA would like to thank Minister Yaluma and his team for their patience 
and generosity in hosting this study. Their engagement and input have 
gone beyond what we could have asked for, and we are grateful for their 
contribution, which has enriched our insights for further RRAs in other 
countries in the 2014-2015 period. Additionally, this report will feed into 
other IRENA regional work, including the Africa Clean Energy Corridor 
initiative, which aims to fill the power-generation gap and expand energy 
access along the length of the continent with high shares of renewable 
energy.
We sincerely hope that the RRA process will help Zambia to achieve its 
ambition to scale up renewable energy. IRENA stands ready to provide 
continuing support to Zambia in implementing the actions identified.

Zambia is a Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) member 
state with a population of nearly 14 million people, an average growth 
rate of 2.9% and a current urbanisation rate of 3.2%. The population 
is 36% rural, with about 67% of the rural population living in extreme 
poverty. The estimated gross domestic product (GDP) in 2011 was 
USD 22.6 billion, translating to a per capita GDP of USD 1,600. The 
energy sector as a whole dominated by biomass, making up over 80% of 
supply and 70% of demand. Electricity is predominantly supplied from 
large hydropower, which provides 99% of the country’s electricity, with 
the remainder coming from mini-hydro and diesel plants. 
The country has significant renewable energy resources, including hydro, 
biomass, solar, wind and geothermal energy that can be exploited for 
both on-grid and off-grid systems. However, the national public utility, 
the Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO), dominates the electricity supply industry (accounting for 94%), with two other operators 
providing a small share (6%) of generation and 86% and 14% of transmission capacity, respectively. For hydro power, the current installed 
capacity is about 1,900 megawatts (MW), while the potential exceeds 
6,000  MW, of which 3,000 MW could be harvested through planned 
projects. Zambia is currently battling an electricity supply deficit and 
has low electrification rates, 45% in urban and 3% in rural areas, while 
aiming to reach 90% and 51% access by 2030 in urban and rural areas, 
respectively. Considering its flexibility and ease of deployment, renewable energy is well poised to contribute to meeting this challenge. For 
this reason, undertaking a thorough renewable-energy resource assessment is essential. Zambia’s untapped potential in the sector, once 
known, can contribute to meeting future electricity demand, especially 
given that the costs of renewable energy are coming down.
Zambia agreed to be part of the Renewable Readiness Assessment 
(RRA) roll-out project supported by the International Renewable Energy 
Agency (IRENA) to enhance deployment of renewable energy in Africa 
and globally. The RRA consultations have given Zambia the chance to 
more carefully consider how to exploit its extensive renewable energy 
resources. This will require technical, policy, regulatory and capacity 
readiness with specific regard to developing renewables. The country, in its energy policy to date, has put more 
emphasis on grid-connected hydropower 
rather than other renewable energy technologies, although key government instruments, including Vision 2030, the Poverty 
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and 
National Development Plans (NDPs) allude 
to the importance of harnessing other 
renewable energy resources to meet the 
country’s growing energy needs. 
In regard to the legislative and regulatory 
framework, Zambia has put in place an 
energy regulator and developed a domestic 
Electricity Act and Energy Regulation Act, 
which provide some regulatory oversight 
of the electricity sector. It has developed 
a draft Zambia Grid Code that includes 
necessary provisions for the integration 
of variable power (large- and small-scale) 
in the grid network. In 1999, the Office 
for Promoting Private Power Investment 
(OPPPI) was established as part of regulatory reforms to support the development 
of the power sector. The OPPPI was set up 
to be a ‘one window operation’ to reduce 
the complexity of procedures, rules, regulations and red tape usually associated 
with obtaining the required approvals, 
permits and licences for investors in the 
electricity sector. In addition, independent power producers (IPPs) have some 
experience generating and/or transmitting electricity to the national grid, and 
IPPs such as the Lunsemfwa Hydropower 
Corporation (LHPC) and the Copperbelt 
Energy Corporation (CEC), along with, 
in recent years, foreign private investors, 
have expressed interest in the powergeneration sector, although mainly for 
large hydropower projects. More effort 
is required to open the electricity market 
to greater participation by IPPs in nonhydro renewable-energy power projects. 
The development of new power projects 
is hampered by the low tariffs prevailing in 
the country. In 2009, the country decided 
to migrate towards cost-reflective tariffs by 
adopting a multi-year tariff framework in 
order to meet future power demand needs 
as well as to ensure quality of service. In 
2010, ZESCO’s average electricity tariff 
was increased to USD 0.065 per kWh, up 
25.6% from 2009. To take the tariff efforts 
a step further, mining-sector tariffs were 
increased by 30% in 2011, though this 
was not carried forward to other sectors. 
ZESCO proposed a four-year tariff increase 
plan and submitted this to the Energy 
Regulation Board (ERB) for approval, with 
the intention of reaching an average tariff 
of USD 0.13 per kWh in 2015. However, this 
plan is still under discussion and has not 
been formally approved. 
As part of its demand side management 
plan, ZESCO plans on deploying 350,000 
solar water heaters in order to save the 
40% of domestic electricity demand that 
is attributed to the use of electric water 
heaters – estimated to account for some 
150 MW. This would help reduce morning 
and evening peak use, which were estimated at around 1,480 MW and 1,630 MW, 
respectively, in 2011. The project is designed 
in a way that the end-user would not 
contribute any of the installation costs of 
the systems, and instead, the utility would 
bear all initial costs. However, the project 
has not moved beyond its pilot phase. 
The current low access to electricity in 
Zambia is expected to improve, in part 
because of the Rural Electrification Master 
Plan (REMP), which is being executed by 
the dedicated Rural Energy Agency (REA) 
formed in 2003. The REMP aims to improve 
rural access to electricity by 15% in 2015 
and 51% in 2030, but this may be hindered 
by the considerable financial resources 
required, as outlined in the plan itself. The 
REA is in charge of the Rural Electrification Fund (REF), where financial resources are 
to be provided for the development of 
rural electrification projects. The fund is 
mainly drawn from a 3% levy on every unit 
of electricity consumed, as well as grants 
and loans from development partners, and 
is aimed at encouraging private-sector 
participation by providing finances for project preparation studies and smart-capital 
subsidies. As part of its mandate, the REA 
has developed an operational manual that 
states it will providea capital subsidy of up 
to 100% for public-led rural electrification 
projects and can support privately-driven 
rural electrification projects with up to 50% 
of their capital costs, with the remaining 
funds to be secured by the developer. 
A large programme for the promotion of 
biofuels was initiated following the adoption of the National Energy Policy (NEP), 
which provides for the use of biofuels as 
a source of modern energy through their 
integration in the transport industry. To 
that end, statutory instruments legalising biofuels, standards and a regulatory 
framework on biodiesel, and pricing methodologies were developed, and a zoning 
exercise was completed, with the support 
of the Government of Brazil. To carry on 
from this initiative, the Biofuels Association 
of Zambia, the Civil Society Biofuels 
Association, and district and provincial 
biofuels farmers associations have all been 
formed. In order to enhance the sector the 
government is expected to declare biofuels a priority sector, so that investors can 
benefit from the appropriate incentives.
KEY RECOMMENDATIONS
Integrated resource planning is becoming 
an important tool that allows key stakeholders to participate in the identification 
School children in Zambia
Courtesy: REAand optimisation of the appropriate mix of 
energy resources to meet near- and longterm electricity needs in a sustainable way. 
It can also enhance a country’s security 
of supply by including all economicallyviable and environmentally-friendly energy 
resources. 
It appears to be beneficial for Zambia to 
initiate a dialogue that would include all 
relevant stakeholders in the development 
of an integrated resource plan (IRP) for 
power generation that will help guide the 
country in diversifying its electricity mix 
while meeting future demand. A prerequisite to such an activity is the undertaking of a thorough renewable energy 
resource assessment. A renewable energy 
resource assessment can trigger a remarkable change in the perceptions of decision 
makers, as well as in their knowledge base 
and awareness of the country’s renewable 
potential and opportunities, thereby allowing them to make more informed decisions. 
Furthermore, a renewable energy resource 
assessment represents a fairly small investment that can attract significant interest 
from the private sector, eventually resulting in energy cost reductions. 
Renewable energy targets that are set 
based on such a resource assessment 
would provide a realistic and achievable 
goal, consistent with the country’s ambitions of adding other renewable energy 
types to the electricity mix. 
Such moves would also provide a clear 
policy signal to attract private-sector 
investment in renewable energy, especially if the target included a mandatory 
clause for power generators and those 
who off-take power in bulk. Establishing a 
renewable energy target would be an ideal 
next step for Zambia after its renewable 
energy resource assessment and should be 
supported by a strong implementation and 
monitoring framework aimed at achieving 
specified target levels. 
Grid integration of non-hydro renewable 
energy-based power requires a thorough 
assessment of grid capability, including for 
variable power, which entails the enhancement of the grid system through operational decision-making tools, long-term 
grid-planning studies, meeting the requirements for renewable power generators, 
and priority access to the grid for electricSolar photovoltaic power plant
Courtesy: REAity generated from renewable energy. The 
revision of the draft Zambia Grid Code to 
include these elements is essential before 
its formal adoption if the country is resolved 
to achieve large-scale deployment of nonhydro renewable energy-based power. 
A programmatic approach for utility-scale 
renewable energy power projects should 
be developed with the requisite financial 
incentives. It should be backed by a standardised bankable PPA in order to attract 
scalable investment, limit elaborate and 
tedious negotiations and allow potential 
investors to form clear expectations about 
their investments.
Zambia aims to increase its rural population’s access to electricity through a wide 
range of solutions in which renewable 
energy plays a critical role. Two of the solutions considered by all stakeholders in the 
sector include the dissemination of solar PV 
systems and the setting up of decentralised 
renewable energy mini-grids. However, 
much more needs to be done to scale up 
the deployment of these technologies. The 
relatively small size of the off-grid market 
and low income of end-users do not make 
it substantially attractive to foreign investors, which is why the sector has mainly 
involved local private operators with the 
support of donors and development partners. Local private operators face technical 
and financial constraints, including lack of 
technical expertise to develop bankable 
proposals, insufficient working capital due 
to difficult access to loans, high interest 
rates due to high risk perception, and lack 
of expertise from local financial institutions 
in appraising off-grid renewable energy 
proposals. Therefore, the capacity of local 
private operators and financial institutions 
alike must be built up, so that they can 
develop and appraise bankable renewable 
energy project proposals.
The country’s objective of increasing rural 
access to electricity would be well served 
by creating a level playing field for local 
private sector involvement. On the one 
hand, the support provided by the OPPPI 
to power project developers (greater than 
10 MW), which includes acquisition of water 
rights, licenses, permits facilitation and 
technical support in Environmental Impact 
Assessments (EIAs), should be extended 
to small-scale decentralised renewable 
energy mini-grids (less than 10  MW). On 
the other hand, the rural electrification 
approach should cater to commerciallyoriented sustainable-electricity service 
delivery, by providing performance and 
matching grants as well as technical 
assistance to private sector-led project 
proposals. 
Affordability of electricity is a key issue in 
rural Zambia. This could be mitigated by 
providing options to facilitate end-user 
access to electricity service, including 
targeted subsidies and deferred payments 
schemes that could be pre-financed, either 
directly by service providers or through a 
micro-finance institution. A sound business 
model should be developed for both standalone systems and mini-grids in order to 
increase the viability and sustainability of 
decentralised renewable energy projects 
and improve access to electricity services 
in rural Zambia. 
As ZESCO has clearly expressed a willingness to deploy solar water heaters (SWHs), 
a programme could be developed involving all relevant stakeholders, including 
the Ministry of Mines, Energy and Water 
Development, Zambia Business Survey, 
Zambia Development Agency and energy 
service companies. Such a programme 
would include capacity building for all 
stakeholders – namely policy makers, 
financial institutions, suppliers, installers and others. These efforts would lead to the 
development and enactment of supportive 
policies and measures, including setting up 
mandatory quotas for different categories 
of end-users, the inclusion of SWHs in building codes, and financial and fiscal incentives. The programme would also bring 
about an effective communication strategy, 
including an awareness-raising campaign 
aimed at customers and financial institutions, and strong quality control comprising the setting up of SWH standards and a 
certification scheme for installers to ensure 
proper operation and maintenance. 
The local market for biofuels is still to be 
established, and entering international 
markets has proven difficult. A review of 
Zambia’s biofuel strategy and the development of sustainability criteria for biofuel 
production could help open the international market. 
Research and development in the 
biofuels sector is paramount in order to 
ensure sound development of thebiofuel value chain. Funding should be made 
available for local research institutions, to 
conduct further assessments of economically feasible energy crops, to experiment 
with cost-effective ways to improve oilyield ratios, and to disseminate lessons 
and best practises to out-growing contract 
farmers and large-scale plantation owners. 
Affordability of electricity is a key issue in 
rural Zambia. This could be mitigated by 
providing options to facilitate end user 
access to electricity service including 
targeted subsidies and deferred payments 
schemes that could be pre-financed directly 
by the service providers or through a microfinance institution. A sound business model 
should be developed for both stand-alone 
systems and mini-grids to increase viability 
and sustainability of decentralised renewable energy projects and access to electricity services in rural Zambia. 
As ZESCO has clearly expressed willingness to deploy SWHs, a programme could 
be developed involving all relevant stakeholders (including the Ministry of Mines, 
Energy and Water Development, Zambia 
Business Survey, Zambia Development 
Agency and energy service companies). 
Such a programme would include capacity building for all stakeholders – namely 
policy makers, financial institutions, suppliers, installers and others. 
These efforts would lead to the development and enactment of supportive policies 
and measures, including setting up mandatory quotas for different categories of end 
users, inclusion of SWHs in building codes, 
and financial and fiscal incentives. 
The programme would also bring about an 
effective communication strategy, including an awareness raising campaign aimed 
at customers and financial institutions, 
and strong quality control comprising the 
setting up of SWHs standards and a certification scheme for installers to ensure 
proper operation and maintenance. 
As the local market for biofuels is still to 
be established and accessing international 
markets has proven difficult, a review of 
the biofuel strategy and the development 
of sustainability criteria for biofuel production could help open the international 
market. 
Research and development in the 
biofuels sector is paramount to ensure 
sound development of the value chain. 
Funding should be made available for local 
research institutions to conduct further 
assessment of economically feasible 
energy crops, experiment on cost effective 
ways to improve the oil yield ratios and 
disseminate lessons learnt and best practises to out-growing contract farmers and 
large-scale plantation owners.I. INTRODUCTION
COUNTRY BACKGROUND
Zambia is located at the heart of the Southern African Development 
Community (SADC) and shares its borders with seven other countries, 
namely Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Malawi, 
Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia. It spans an area of 
752,681 square kilometre (km2) and reaches an altitude of 2,300 metres 
(m) above sea level on the high plateau. Zambia is subdivided into ten 
provinces, with a total population of 13.8 million. The average population 
growth rate is 3.06% and the urbanisation rate projected for the years 
2010-2015 is 3.2%. 
Zambia has experienced strong economic growth in the past decade, 
averaging 6% gross domestic product (GDP) growth per annum, and is 
expected to reach 7.5% growth in 2013. The main contributor of GDP 
is the service sector, which accounts for 70%, followed by the agriculture sector with 20% and the mining and manufacturing sector with 10% 
(African Economic Outlook (AEO), 2013). More specifically, the strong 
growth can be attributed to a combination of improved macro-economic 
management, economic liberalisation and privatisation and a resource 
boom. Although the country’s economic and governance landscape is 
improving, challenges remain. In the 2014 Doing Business report, the 
country ranked 83rd out of 185 countries, representing a seven-place 
improvement from the previous year (World Bank, 2013).
Despite strong economic growth, there has been slow progress in improving human development and social conditions. Indeed, the 2011 Human 
Development Report (UNDP, 2013) ranked Zambia 163 out of 187 listed 
countries with a Human Development Index (HDI) score of 0.45, against 
0.48 for the Sub-Saharan Africa average, and with the exception of 
education, Zambia was expected to miss most Millennium Development 
Goals. In addition, inequalities in incomes, assets and social services are 
on the rise, along with unemployment (worsening from 22% in 2005 
to 28% in 2010). This is due to the fact that 95% of employed labour 
is estimated to be in the category of temporary or vulnerable worker 
or is involved in the informal sector (AEO, 2013). This is further exacerbated by a labour force with low skill level that is concentrated around 
sectors such as mining, construction and services. In order to address 
some of these challenges, the government increased the budget share 
of its social protection programme to 2.8% in 2013 with the objective of 
pursuing various social safety net programmes such as public welfare 
assistance and social cash transfers. ENERGY FOR DEVELOPMENT
The Government of Zambia highlights 
energy as being a driving force for the 
socio-economic development of the 
nation. This is evidenced through its 
Zambia Vision 2030, which represents the 
first long-term plan of the country’s aspiration to become a prosperous middleincome nation. More specifically, the 
vision aims to provide “universal access 
to clean, reliable and affordable energy 
at the lowest total economic, financial, 
social and environmental cost, consistent with national development goals, by 
2030”. Consequently, the government has 
been undertaking a number of actions to 
improve access to reliable and affordable 
energy services, by developing five-year 
National Development Plans (NDPs) with 
a clear role for energy. The 6th NDP (2011 
to 2015) focuses on securing reliable and 
affordable electricity supplies to spur the 
expansion of the country’s growth sectors, 
namely mining, agriculture, tourism and 
manufacturing (Ministry of Finance and 
National Planning (MOFNP), 2011). With 
the national electrification rate standing at 22% (45% urban and 3% rural), a 
specific focus has been placed on enhancing national access to electricity to at least 
40% nationally by 2015 (with 15% access 
rate for rural communities). 
Mining is one of the most important 
sectors of the Zambian economy, contributing about 9% directly to GDP in 2010 
(USD  590  million), with possible indirect 
contribution to the economy being as much 
as 50%. The direct contribution may reach 
USD 1.35 billion by 2015 (Zambia Extractive 
Industry Transparency Initiative, 2010). 
Moreover the sector is the major contributor of foreign exchange earnings, accounting for an estimated 70% of total earnings 
in 2010. Copper exports alone accounted 
for 78% of the Zambia’s total exports in 
2010 (Ibid), with a value of USD 5.8 billion. 
The sector is currently the major energy 
consumer and will need to be adequately 
supplied to maintain the key role it plays in 
the national economy.
Given Zambia’s vast natural resources in 
terms of land, water and fertile soil, and 
with over 80% of the population relying 
on agriculture-related activities for their 
subsistence, transforming the agriculture 
sector is paramount to achieving the Vision 
2030. However, the sector faces many 
challenges that result in low agriculture 
productivity, including the use of traditional agricultural practises and the lack of 
infrastructure and machinery to conserve 
and transform harvest into higher value 
agro-industrial products. Energy can play 
an important role in moving from subsistence-led agriculture to an agro-industry 
and export-oriented sector while ensuring 
greater food security.
Finally, traditional biomass is the country’s main source of energy, accounting 
for more than 70% of energy consumption with 57% of urban populations using 
traditional biomass and 97% in rural areas 
(Central Statistical Office, 2012). Firewood 
is mostly used for cooking in rural areas 
while the main fuel used in urban areas is 
charcoal. The charcoal industry is thought 
to employ about 500,000 individuals in 
the country along its supply chain, including producers, distributers and marketers 
(Mwitwa and Makano, 2012).
THE RENEWABLES READINESS 
ASSESSMENT (RRA) 
PROCESS IN ZAMBIA
The Renewable Readiness Assessment 
(RRA) endeavour for Zambia was heavily reliant on a senior official of the 
Department of Energy (DoE) of the Ministry 
of Mines Energy and Water Development 
(MMEWD). As a first step, the Department 
of Energy official and the national consul-tant were both made familiar with the RRA 
methodology. Next, national experts were 
identified from key institutions (including 
policy-making, regulatory and promotion 
agencies, non-governemntal organisations (NGOs), financial institutions, private 
sector and academia/research) to participate in the process. An initial consultation 
with the identified stakeholders led to the 
identification of three main areas of focus 
for the RRA in Zambia that are: on-grid 
electricity, off-grid electricity and biofuels. 
The stakeholders were divided into subgroups according to the three areas aforementioned and met to select and discuss 
the relevant service resource pairs for the 
country, capturing current status, issues/
problems, capacity needs and proposed 
concrete actions. 
The RRA Workshop was organised on 10-11 
December 2012 and saw participation from 
the National Expert Team, the International 
Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and 
SADC, where they reviewed the templates, 
provided further inputs and built a consensus on the recommended actions. Bilateral 
meetings were also scheduled for IRENA 
and the SADC with high level stakeholders from the government, utility, private 
sector and financial institutions to balance 
and complement the process. Based on the 
outcomes of the RRA workshop and the 
findings from the bilateral meetings, the 
RRA report was drafted and submitted for 
peer-review. 
This document presents the Zambia RRA 
Country Report. The report is structured 
into five substantive sections. 
Section 1 presents the introduction, 
covering country background, the IRENA 
RRA methodology and process, and the 
RRA process in Zambia. 
Section 2 presents both the energy and 
renewable energy context in the region, 
an overview of the energy sector in 
Zambia, challenges facing the energy 
sector, and an overview of renewable 
energy potential and use. 
This section also provides a detailed 
discussion of the electricity sector. 
Section 3 explores Zambia’s energy 
sector institutions, the policy and regulatory framework as well as the conditions for financing and investment in the 
country. Section 4 presents the emergent issues with respect to solar/wind 
electricity (on-grid), a range of decentralised (off-grid) applications, and 
the biomass sector. Opportunities and 
constraints that affect the scaling up of 
the deployment of these technologies 
will be discussed along with the findings 
from the RRA process. Section 5 presents 
the recommended actions necessary for 
scaling up renewable energy systems in 
Zambia. Finally, the detailed account of 
the recommended actions from the RRA 
can be found in the Annex.

REGIONAL CONTEXT
Zambia is a member state of the SADC that was formed in 1992 and 
is currently comprised of 15 countries1
. The SADC population is about 
280 million and its combined GDP in 2010 of USD 575.5 billion was growing at 5.14%. In 2008, the SADC primary energy supply was estimated 
around 9,552 petajoules (PJ) (International Energy Agency, 2011). Coal 
dominated the primary energy mix with a large share of 44%, followed 
by renewable energy (39%), oil (14%), gas (2%), and nuclear (1%). The 
39% share for renewable energy is distributed among traditional biomass 
(36.66%), primarily used for cooking and heating, hydro (1.95%), and 
modern biomass (0.39%). Other renewable energy sources such as solar, 
geothermal, wind and biofuels were negligible (Ibid).
The SADC has drawn up many energy access goals. The strategic goal 
of energy access to adequate and reliable energy services for the 
entire SADC region was identified as playing a pivotal role in achieving a regional growth rate of 7% and reducing poverty on a sustainable 
basis. As a step toward this objective, the SADC established an operational goal to reduce the number of SADC inhabitants who do not have 
access to energy services by 50% by 2020, and halve the number of 
those remaining without access every five years until the strategic goal 
of full access is achieved. The 10-year goal to halve the number of people 
without energy access is indicative of the political will in the region to 
address energy access. Efforts to increase access to energy focus on the 
expansion of distribution networks, often implemented by the national 
utilities, and the use of small-scale distributed generation, often implemented through Rural Electrification Agencies (REAs) or funds.
Furthermore, the SADC is putting in place a Regional Renewable Energy 
and Energy Efficiency Agency (SACREEE) in response to the requirement 
identified by the SADC member countries’ ministries of energy and other 
regional stakeholders during a consultation process. Upon its establishment, the SACREEE will concentrate on creating the enabling environment for the uptake of renewable energy and energy efficiency through 
energy planning and policies; business models and technical innovation; 
1 SADC continental member countries are: Angola, Botswana, the DRC, Lesotho, 
Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and 
Zimbabwe. The island member countries are; Madagascar, Mauritius and Seychelles.finance and risk management; capacity 
building and knowledge management
In 1995, 12 continental SADC member 
countries signed an inter-governmental 
memorandum of understanding (MoU) 
that led to the creation of the Southern 
African Power Pool (SAPP) with the aim of 
creating a common market for electricity 
that would provide reliable and economical electricity to the consumers in each 
SAPP member country, optimise the use 
of available energy resources in the region, 
and support inter-country co-operation 
during emergencies. This initiative has 
been furthered by the 1996 signing of the 
Regional Energy Protocol, which recognises the need for a co-ordinated approach 
to energy strategy formulation and planning for the SADC.
The SAPP electricity mix is dominated by 
coal with 74% of the total, followed by hydro 
20% (largely from the Congo and Zambezi 
basins), nuclear 4% and diesel 2% (SADC, 
2012). As of 2012, SAPP’s total installed 
capacity was 57,182 Megawatts (MW) with 
an available capacity of 51,702 MW, against 
a peak demand of 53,833 MW (SAPP, 2013). 
The region is facing a critical power shortage due to escalating demand growth and 
capacity addition projects that are lagging 
behind targeted schedules. In 2009 the 
first SAPP master plan was commissioned 
based on member countries’ national plans 
and envisaged an additional total capacity 
of 56 GW by 2025 composed of 23,883 MW 
of coal, 18,045 MW of hydro, 14,758 MW of 
gas and no non-hydro renewable energy. 
However, as countries are aspiring to 
a cleaner electricity mix, this has been 
reflected in their national plans and in the 
2012 SAPP plans, with additional capacity of 55.5  GW comprising of 9,650  MW 
of coal, 14,646 MW of hydro, 9,600 MW of 
nuclear, 7,600 MW of gas and 14,000 MW 
of non-hydro renewable energy (wind and 
solar).
Electricity generation, transmission 
and distribution in the SAPP are mainly 
provided by publicly-owned, vertically 
integrated national utilities. Independent 
Power Producers (IPPs) and independent transmission companies (ITCs) have 
now been introduced by different SADC 
countries, albeit with varying degrees of 
success. Policies in most countries reflect 
an aspiration for greater private sector 
involvement in power generation, but 
efforts are hampered by risk perceptions 
from investors due to unfavourable legal 
and regulatory frameworks for private 
sector participation (namely, concerns 
over competition between public and 
private generation assets), and difficulties 
in developing well-structured bankable 
projects (Development Bank of Southern 
Africa, 2010).
The interconnected grid is operated 
through three control areas run by 
Eskom (for Botswana, Lesotho, Southern 
Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland and 
South Africa), Zimbabwe Electricity Supply 
Authority (for Zimbabwe and Northern 
Mozambique) and ZESCO (for the DRC and 
Zambia). The three utilities, or the system 
operators, are responsible for balancing 
electricity supply and demand and power 
flows within their control areas. Besides 
being one of the control area operators, 
Zambia plays a critical role in the SAPP, 
both as a supplier of hydropower from 
the Zambezi River Basin, but also an 
interconnector to the Congo River Basin. 
Lunsemfwa Hydro Power Company and 
Copperbelt Energy Corporation are two 
successful IPPs in Zambia, with the later 
also being an ITC. Most of the SAPP power 
exchanges take place within the Eastern 
and Central area shown in more detail in 
Figure 1. 
The Zambian power grid is interconnected 
to the DRC in the north and Zimbabwe in 
the south. On-going projects seek to inter-Figure 1

northeast, Malawi in the east and Namibia 
in the west through the Zimbabwe-ZambiaBotswana-Namibia interconnector. Zambia 
is also a participant in the SAPP Day Ahead 
Market (previously known as the Short 
Term Energy Market).
ENERGY SUPPLY AND 
DEMAND IN ZAMBIA
The total primary energy supply of Zambia 
is composed of four main sources: biomass, 
hydro, oil and coal (Figure 2). Biomass 
(firewood and charcoal) is very important, accounting for 80% of the country’s energy needs by providing 284  PJ 
mainly for household cooking and heating 
purposes. In 2011, hydropower met 12% of 
the energy needs, providing 41  PJ mainly 
for electricity. Oil products accounted for 
9% of the energy needs, used mostly for 
transport and electricity generation. As 
Zambia currently does not produce any 
crude oil, the country relies entirely on 
imports through a 1,500 km pipeline from 
Tanzania to a local refinery (with a capacity 
of 1 million tonnes) where it is refined into 
petrol, kerosene, diesel, aviation gas, and 
heavy fuel oil. Oil imports cost the country about USD 0.5 billion per annum (2.3% 
of GDP in 2011). Although there are proven 
recoverable reserves of coal estimated at 
around 30 million tonnes, and with copper 
mines utilising about 2,000 tonnes of coal 
annually, the contribution of coal in the 
current energy mix remains insignificant. 
However the country does plan on expanding its generation capacity by an additional 
600 MW of coal by the end of 2014.
Figure 2
Total Primary Energy Supply by FuelELECTRICITY SYSTEM
The Zambia electricity sector is composed 
of a state-owned, vertically-integrated utility named ZESCO, a private company that 
generates power to the grid and manages 
off-grid small hydro systems called the 
Lunsemfwa Hydro Power Company (LHPC), 
and the Copperbelt Energy Company2 
(CEC); the latter provides electricity to 
the bulk of the mining sector from power 
purchased from ZESCO, and through 
its own gas-fired power plants. Finally 
the Zengamina Hydro Power Company 
(ZHPC) and the North West Energy 
Corporation  (NWEC) distribute electricity to rural mining communities from offgrid mini hydro plants and the national 
grid, respectively (Figure 3). ZESCO, the 
CEC and the LHPC are currently the major 
power generators with shares of 94%, 4% 
and 2%, respectively. With regard to transmission activities, the respective shares are 
69%, 29%, and 2%.
Electricity demand grew by an average 
rate of 3.5% between 2002 and 2010 with 
about 45% consumed by the mining industry, 30% by the residential sector, 15% by 
the commerce and industry sectors and 
2 Since 2012, the CEC has been an independent power transmitter as part of the SAPP.
Figure 3
Zambia Power Sector
Source: Kapika and Eberhard, 2013 the rest consumed by export, social and 
agricultural services (Figure 4).
Demand for electricity is projected to 
grow, with mining expected to consume 
49%, industry/commerce 20%, residential 
15%, agriculture 10%, social 5% and exports 
2% of electricity produced according to 
the 2018 demand forecast. The current 
total installed capacity of 1,976 MW is only 
providing about 1,650 MW of power while 
peak demand is estimated at 1,800  MW 
and growing at 100  MW per year. Based 
on this it can be seen that electricity 
demand has clearly outstripped generation, with a power deficit during peak time 
of 250  MW, thus resulting in some challenges in the form of interruption in power 
supply (ZESCO, 2013b). This is corroborated by the load shedding timetable that 
ZESCO makes available for its customers. To address these issues Zambia has 
therefore developed the Zambia Power 
Rehabilitation Project (PRP), which is 
expected to fill in the electricity supply 
demand gap and include rehabilitation of 
existing power stations, upgrade transmission and distribution lines, as well as 
demand side management measures with 
a budget of more than USD  320  million 
supported by the World Bank, European 
Investment Bank (EIB) and ZESCO. 
Regarding demand side management, 
ZESCO plans on deploying energy efficient 
light bulbs, prepaid metres and solar water 
heaters to shave off-peak loads. 
Figure 4
Historical Electricity Consumption of Zambia by Sector
Source: ZESCO, 2013aGENERATION CAPACITY
The PRP has allowed ZESCO to increase its 
installed capacity by an additional 210 MW 
by upgrading the Kafue Gorge Hydro Dam 
to 990 MW from 900 MW, the Kariba North 
Bank Dam to 720 MW from 600 MW and 
bringing the Victoria Falls Power Station 
to its full generating capacity of 108 MW. 
Additionally, a number of generation 
projects are to be developed in the short 
term (both hydro and coal) including the 
Kariba North Bank, Maamba Coal-Fired 
Thermal Power Station, Lunzua Mini-Hydro 
Power Plant, Itezhi-Tezhi Dam, EMCO CoalFired Thermal Power Station, Kabompo, 
Kalungwishi Hydroelectric Project and 
Kafue Gorge Lower (Table 1). If this project 
pipeline is commissioned as expected, the 
country’s energy generation mix will shift 
from 99% hydro-based to just over 60% 
hydro-based by 2017.
In the medium- to long-term, the country 
intends to further tap into its hydropower 
potential, estimated at about 6,000  MW, 
to develop an additional 2,800 MW of new 
generation.
Rural areas that are not connected to the 
national grid are supplied by diesel power 
stations (with a total capacity of 7  MW) 
and decentralised micro hydro power 
stations (with a total capacity of less than 
1 MW) (MEWD, 2009). 
Qualitative resource potential for off-grid 
is reasonably known but there is a need for 
a comprehensive study to quantify these 
potentials. 
GRID INFRASTRUCTURE
The Zambia National Grid is composed of 
the main 330 kilovolts (kV) trunk line that 
spans a total of 2,241 km across the country, 
from the south where the main hydropower 
generation stations are located (Kariba 
North and Kafue dams), to the north in 
the Copperbelt area where the main load 
centres are located due to mining activities. The rest of the transmission network is 
composed of 348 km of 220 kV lines serving as interconnectors with the neighbouring DRC, Namibia and Zimbabwe, 202 km 
of 132 kV lines and 754  km of 88 kV mainly 
in the Lusaka area, and 3,033 km of load

Based on: ZESCO, ERB, CECtransmission lines, and 66 kV in the northeastern and western part of the country 
(Figure 5). 
As part of the PRP, ZESCO plans on 
upgrading existing transmission infrastructures and developing new ones to evacuate additional power from rehabilitated 
and new power plants (Table 2). In addition 
to these projects, the country has planned 
on further expanding the national grid to 
the north-western province to new mining 
areas and developing new interconnectors 
with neighbouring countries to increase 
power trade.
The country had identified grid extension as being the main strategy to expand 
access to rural areas as highlighted in the 
2009 Rural Electrification Master Plan 
(REMP). The REMP was developed with the 
following principles: 
 Develop a logical, objective, numerical/
quantitative, and convincing master 
plan.
Based on: ZESCO (2013b) Map, pg 12
Figure 5
Zambia National Grid Network and Regional Interconnectors Adopt a decentralised planning process3
for selecting Rural Growth Centres 
(RGCs) and demand/ supply criteria4 for 
their clustering into packages (180).
 Provide realistic a financial plan to be 
implemented.
The REMP identified that 80% of the country’s RGCs will be electrified through grid 
extension. However in order to achieve the 
goals set in the REMP an annual amount 
of USD 50 million is required. Mobilising 
this amount has been so far a challenge, 
leading to slow progress in reaching annual 
targets of the REMP. 
Finally, the country’s distribution network 
consists of the main distribution network 
fed from the national grid and isolated 
networks served through stand-alone 
diesel generators and small hydro power 
plants. The total system losses in the 
Zambia grid network were estimated at 
13.1%, with transmission losses averaging 
4.6% and distribution losses averaging 
13.8% in 2011 (ZESCO, 2011). 
COSTS AND TARIFFS 
Current production cost for large hydro 
plants, based on the available sizes feeding into the national grid, range between 
USD  0.02 to USD  0.03  per  kilowatt-hour 
(kWh), while the production cost for 
small and mini-hydro plant range between 
USD  0.50 to USD  1  per  kWh, and finally 
USD 0.35 per  Wh for isolated diesel power 
plants (Electricity Regulation Board (ERB), 
2008).
Prior to 2008, Zambia enjoyed the lowest 
electricity tariff in Southern Africa, with an 
average tariff of USD 0.027 per kWh, which 
given the generation costs, are clearly not 
cost reflective. This may have hampered 
new investment in the power sector and 
could partly explain why the last power

3 RGCs have been selected as electrifi cation candidates based on information submitted by district planners 
who attended workshops held in all the nine provincial centres.
4 For the demand side potential, daily peak demands for the 1,217 un-electrifi ed RGCs were forecasted by 
using the demographic data of these 1,217 RGCs and analysing the data collected from 19 electrifi ed RGCs 
in the Socio-Economic Survey. 
For supply side, the Unit Lifetime Cost (USD/kWh) of each electrifi cation mode (grid extension, solar 
home systems, mini-hydro and diesel generator) was estimated, and electrifi cation mode having the 
least Unit Lifetime Cost was selected as the optimal case.generation project was commissioned 
more than 40 years ago. In 2009, the 
country decided to migrate towards costreflective tariffs by adopting a multi-year 
tariff framework in order to meet future 
power demand needs as well ensure quality of service. Therefore in 2010, ZESCO’s 
average electricity tariff was increased to 
USD 0.065 per kWh (up 25.6% from 2009). 
In 2011, a further step was made to increase 
the tariffs of the mining sector by 30%, 
with no incidence on other sectors. ZESCO 
proposed a four year tariff increase plan 
and submitted it to the ERB for approval 
with the intention of reaching an average 
tariff of USD 0.13  per kWh in 2015 (Table 
3). 
The rationale behind this tariff application 
is underlined by the prevailing economic 
conditions, the changes in generation, 
transmission and distribution costs, the 
expansion of the system and thereby the 
customer base and the rising cost of electricity imports. 
RENEWABLE ENERGY POTENTIAL
Zambia is well endowed with renewable 
energy resources, mainly hydropower in 
nature. These sources have great potential 
for electricity production and use in many 
sectors, but data on renewable energy 
resources is not readily available as shown 
in Table 4.
SMALL HYDRO 
Zambia’s hydro power potential is estimated at more than 6,000 MW with only 
1,700  MW so far exploited. The Rural 
Energy Agency (REA) identified 29 small/
mini hydro sites mainly in Northern and 
Luapula, (4  MW) and North-Western 
Province (13 MW). A number of feasibility 
studies have been undertaken in selected 
minihydro potential sites and the planned 
small hydro capacity (<30 MW) till 2019 is 
about 45 MW. For off-grid application, there 
are plans by the private sector to develop 
additional off-grid hydro power projects

hydropower generation plant at Chikata 
Falls and a 500  KW power generation 
plant at Kasanjiku Falls in Kabompo and 
Mwinilunga districts, respectively, in NorthWestern Province.
BIOMASS
Zambia has a total biomass resource 
and economic bioenergy potential of 
2.15  million  tonnes, and 498  MW, respectively (MEWD, 2008). The largest contribution is from agriculture waste, which registered 90% of total potential followed by 
forest waste with 9.3%.
ZESCO, in conjunction with United Nations 
Industrial Development Organisation 
(UNIDO), had planned to install a 1  MW 
biomass electricity generation plant to 
meet the electricity needs of Kaputa 
District. This facility was meant to replace 
440  KW installed capacity of a diesel 
power generation system. ZESCO has 
since extended the national grid to Kaputa, 
resulting in the concept being taken 
over by the CEC, which will utilise feedstock from sawmills on the Copperbelt. 
Another on-going biomass-based electricity generation activity in Zambia is 
being implemented at Nakambala Sugar

120,000 tonnes of bagasse from the sugar 
cane crushing component of the factory 
to generate 17 MW of electricity. A similar 
technology is used at Kafue Sugar, but with 
a smaller output of 3 MW.
SOLAR ENERGY
Zambia has an average solar insolation 
of 5.5  kWh/m2/day, with approximately 
3,000  sunshine hours annually, providing good potential for solar thermal and 
photovoltaic applications. A preliminary 
solar energy potential assessment for 
Zambia was undertaken using Geographic 
Information System data. Red regions have 
the highest solar irradiance values up to 
2,750  kWh/m2. Zambia’s northern areas 
recorded the highest global solar irradiation of 2,300 kWh/m2/year (Figure 6).
The REA has developed a solar mini-grid 
in Samfya District, Luapula Province. The 
solar mini-grid project is expected togenerate 60  KW of electricity, which will be 
supplied to a cluster of villages in the Mpata 
fishing community, which has an estimated 
total population of 6,000 people and 617 
households. The project is being implemented under a loan facility agreement 
between the Development Bank of Zambia 
(DBZ) and the REA. The interest-free loan 
from the Development Bank of Zambia 
was facilitated by UNIDO, under the Global 
Environment Facility (GEF) agreement. 
The REA is providing part of the investment cost for the project. The government of Zambia has received tenders from 
various institutions to develop a total of 
30  MW solar photovoltaic (PV), comprising 10 MW in the North-Western Province, 
10 MW in Eastern Province, and 10 MW in 
Luapula on a build-own-operate (BOO) 
model. The bid process is still to be implemented and a policy is required to leverage 
tariffs currently being charged by ZESCO 
for on-grid customers. 
GEOTHERMAL
Historic surveys have identified over 80 
hot and mineralised springs in Zambia. 
Subsequently, a detailed study by an 
Italian-Zambian joint venture in the mid1980s identified five prospective sites. 
Kalahari GeoEnergy Ltd., a self-funded 
private company, entered into an agreement with Government of Zambia in March 
2011 under which the company would 
undertake geothermal research, exploration and development. The company has 
conducted field reconnaissance including 
hydrochemistry on all identified geotherBiomass power generation.
Courtesy: REAmal targets, and geophysics on the more 
prospective targets. Having formulated 
a conceptual model, Kalahari GeoEnergy 
will conduct preliminary drilling at its first 
target, which is a low enthalpy system in 
a shallow sedimentary setting. It is anticipated that reservoir modelling and a test 
well will be completed during 2013 and a 
feasibility study will be completed in 2014. 
By targeting low-enthalpy geothermal 
systems, Kalahari GeoEnergy expects to be 
able to define a number of commercially 
viable geothermal sites across Zambia, 
which would provide both on-grid and 
off-grid power production capability, thus 
potentially benefiting both established 
users and the rural electrification and 
industrialisation programmes. Also, by 
using modular binary power plants, feasible targets can be brought into production 
more quickly at a lower capital cost than 
for large direct steam-fed turbines.

required on comprehensive resource 
assessments to guide policy formulation 
to support geothermal energy; including 
building capacity to design, build, operate 
and maintain geothermal plants in Zambia, 
along the lines that Kenya has developed 
in using this technology. South-South 
co-operation with regards to an exchange 
of resources, technology and knowledge 
with Kenya is commended, but should 
culminate in technology transfer in addition to building capacity and skills.
WIND ENERGY
Wind speeds in Zambia average 3 metres 
per second (m/s) at 10 m above the ground, 
a speed which is mainly suitable for 
mechanical applications. Some meteorological data on wind speeds at 10 m above 
ground is available, but is not adequate to 
guide investment for power generation. At 
that height, wind energy is only useful for 
mechanical energy, such as water pumping. Indications that higher wind speeds 
may exist at higher heights, e.g., 70 m to 
100 m, needs to be explored to direct any 
strategy to develop wind in Zambia. 
Encouraging wind hotspots at a higher 
altitude were identified from a recent 
SADC study (2012), the Renewable 
Energy Strategy and Action Plan, around 
Chongwe area east of Lusaka (Location: 
28°  47'  40"  East, 15°  30'  45"  South), and 
along the Muchinga escarpment centred 
on Chipembele (Location: 31° 28' 57" East, 
12°  1'  53"  South), which are shown in 
Figure 7.

POLICIES AND STRATEGIES
In 1994, Zambia formulated a National Energy Policy (NEP94) aimed 
at promoting optimal supply and utilisation of energy, especially indigenous energy forms, for socio-economic development in a safe and 
healthy environment. 
In 2002, the country formulated a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 
(PRSP) that acknowledged the importance of harnessing renewable 
energy resources, mainly hydropower, to meet the country’s energy 
needs, but did not stipulate the strategy for doing so. 
Furthermore several five-year National Development Plans (NDPs), 
namely the Transitional National Development Plan (TNDP) (2002-
2005), the Fifth National Development Plan (FNDP) (2006-2010), and 
the Sixth National Development Plan (SNDP) (2011-2015), provided 
additional perspective with respect to the development of renewable 
energy in the country.
The SNDP has capacity addition targets of 1,000 MW above the 2010 
capacity level and aims to increase electricity access to 15% in rural areas 
and 40% in urban areas by 2015. In addition, it also provides for the 
introduction of a cost-reflective electricity tariff regime, establishing an 
open and non-discriminatory transmission access regime in the electricity sector, and introducing an appropriate cost-effective renewable 
energy feed-in tariff (FiT). Finally the SNDP laid out the framework for 
developing a Biomass Energy Strategy to improve the sustainability and 
effectiveness of biomass supply, as well as how to upscale biogas technologies for cooking, lighting and electricity generation, while targeting 
a 10% biofuel blending mix with petroleum.
The implementation of the PRSP and the NDPs has raised new insight 
and awareness among decision makers on the cross-cutting role of 
energy in socio-economic development. This prompted a review of 
the NEP94 in order to take into account recent changes not only in the 
energy sector and domestic economy, but also at the regional and international level. The review of the NEP was conducted in 2008 through 
an extensive consultative process that encompassed a wide range of 
individuals and institutions in the country.The new National Energy Policy formed in 
2008 (MEWD, 2008) set out the government’s intentions to ensure that the energy 
sector’s potential to drive economic growth 
and reduce poverty is harnessed. Some of 
the key issues that have emerged from the 
policy review include the need to recognise 
the cross cutting nature of energy. Critical 
social and economic services like health 
and education cannot be efficiently and 
effectively provided in the absence of reliable and affordable energy services. The 
new energy policy further takes account 
of important issues, such as the high incidence of poverty, the HIV/AIDS epidemic, 
gender, environment, household energy, 
rural electrification and the role renewable energy can play in Zambia’s future 
energy mix. More specifically, on renewable energy, the objective of the NEP is to 
address barriers to the wide deployment of 
renewable energy technologies (RETs). 
In 2010, a draft Renewable Energy Strategy 
was developed in order to translate the 
objectives of the NEP into a practical implementation plan. The key objectives of this 
strategy, in line with the goals of the NEP, 
FNDP 2006-2010 and the Vision 2030 are:
• Access to modern energy services for all
• Meeting growing energy demand in a 
sustainable way
The renewable energy strategy includes 
long-term renewable energy targets for 
specific applications. In terms of electricity, the targets are to generate 100  MW 
from solar, 200 MW from small hydro and 
100  MW from biomass by 2030. In addition, it envisages the dissemination of 
500,000 solar home systems and installation of 350,000 solar water heaters 
in order to reduce the demand load by 
150  MW. The strategy was developed in 
two phases. The first phase consisted of 
collecting data and conducting situation 
analysis of the resources in solar, biomass, 
small hydro, wind and geothermal energy. 
In the second phase, a strategy was developed based on the situation analysis. The 
strategy, however, has not been adopted as 
of now.
In the same year the Rural Electrification 
Master Plan (REMP) was developed with 
the support of the Japanese International 
Cooperation Agency (JICA) through a 
high-level consultative process (MEWD, 
2009). The REMP is the blueprint for rural 
electrification for the period 2008-2030 
and is to be implemented by the Rural 
Electrification Agency (REA). The REMP 
has identified 1,217 rural growth centres 
(RGC) throughout the country to be electrified during that timeframe. These rural 
growth centres will be electrified using 
three main methods: 
i) extension of the national grid; 
ii) construction of mini-hydro power stations 
where potential exists; and 
iii) installation of solar home systems. 
 Adequate implementation of the REMP 
would increase the rural electrification 
rate of 3% in 2008 to 51% by 2030 at an 
estimated cost of about USD 1.1 billion, 
translating into an annual expenditure 
of USD 50 million.
LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
The following instruments have been so 
far adopted/initiated by the Government 
of Zambia for the promotion of the energy 
sector:
Electricity Act of 1995 (amended 2003): 
The act was formulated to regulate the 
generation, transmission and distribu-tion of electricity in Zambia. It liberalised 
the electricity sector by opening all three 
segments to private operators and led the 
government to set up two key new institutions. The Energy Regulation Board was 
tasked with regulating the operations and 
pricing of the electricity sector while the 
OPPPI was meant to attract new players to 
the electricity market. 
Energy Regulation Act of 1995 (amended 
in 2003): The act established the Energy 
Regulation Board and defined its functions and powers as regulating the energy 
sector in a fair, transparent, effective and 
efficient way to safeguard the interest of 
all stakeholders. The ERB is responsible 
for establishing fuel prices (including electricity tariffs), establishing and monitoring 
the application of the Zambia Grid Code, 
and designing standards with regards to 
the quality, safety and reliability of supply 
of energy in conjunction with the Zambia 
Bureau of Standards.
Rural Electrification Act of 2003: The 
act established the Rural Electrification 
Authority and equipped it with a Rural 
Electrification Fund. The REA is responsible for implementing the REMP by facilitating the creation and monitoring the 
operation of rural electrification organisations or companies. These organisation and companies (including entrepreneurs, community-based organisation and 
others), shall fulfil their obligations and 
perform in accordance with standards and 
appropriate tariff structures (jointly set up 
with the ERB), keeping a balance between 
the need for affordability with sustainability of electricity delivery systems. The 
Rural Electrification Fund is to be sourced 
by monies approved by the parliament, as 
well as electricity levies, loans, grants and 
donations from any sources in Zambia. 
Funding from sources outside the country 
must be approved by the minister. 
The Zambia Grid Code of 2006: The 
Zambia Grid Code was drafted in 2006 
with the objective of facilitating open and 
non-discriminatory access to the transmission system in order to ensure that the 
goals of liberalisation of the electricity 
sector, primarily enhanced efficiency and 
more rapid electrification, are achieved. 
Although the document has been drafted 
and reviewed, it is still being considered for 
adoption.
FINANCING AND INVESTMENT
The energy sector in Zambia has traditionally been funded and implemented by the 
government through ZESCO and by IPPs 
and IPTs (namely the CEC, Lunsemfwa 
Hydropower Company and Northwestern 
Energy Corporation). However, in recent 
years, the sector has attracted investment from private foreign investors 
as well as development partners and 
institutions. These include, the ChinaAfrica Development Fund (CAD Fund), 
EXIM Bank of India, the World Bank, the 
African Development Bank, the European 
Investment Bank, the French Agency for 
Development and the Development Bank 
of Southern Africa.Although most of these 
investments have been for the most part 
geared toward the development of large 
hydropower dams and transmission infrastructures, this renewed interest of financiers in the sector is mainly due to the 
favourable investment framework that 
includes fiscal and non-fiscal incentives as 
well as investment subsidies.
The ZDA was established in 2006 by an 
Act of Parliament in the frame of private 
sector support programmes to make the 
country more conducive to business. In 
line with the economic reforms, the ZDA is 
encouraging private investment in all priority productive sectors including agriculture, mining, manufacturing, tourism and energy. In that regards, the development of 
power plants to generate electricity from 
various energy resources, including renewable energy, qualify for tax exemptions 
under the ZDA Act’s priority sector incentives. The tax concessions for various types 
of investment are outlined as follows: 
GENERAL INCENTIVES 
INCOME TAX: 
• Income earned by companies in the 
first year of listing on the Lusaka Stock 
Exchange qualifies for a 2% discount 
on the applicable company tax rate in 
the particular sector. 
 However, companies with more than 
one-third of their shareholding in the 
hands of Zambians qualify for a 7% 
discount.
• Initial allowance of 10% on capital 
expenditure incurred on the construction or improvement of an industrial 
building is deductible.
• Foreign exchange losses of a capital 
nature incurred on borrowings for the 
building and construction of an industrial or commercial building are tax 
deductible. 
• Carry forward of losses up to five years. 
VALUE ADDED TAX (VAT):
• Relief for VAT-registered enterprises 
on imports of eligible capital goods. 
• Zero rate on export of taxable products.
• Relief of VAT on transfer of business as 
a going concern.
• Equal treatment of services for 
VAT-reverse VAT.
• VAT relief on input tax paid for purchases 
made by registered suppliers.
• Input tax claim for three months prior 
to VAT registration for businesses that 
have already commenced trading.

(ENERGY-SECTOR INCLUSIVE):
• Zero percent tax rate on dividends for 
five years from year of first declaration 
of dividends.
• Zero percent tax on profits for five 
years from the first year profits are 
made. For years six to eight, only 50% 
of profits are taxable and for years 
none and ten, only 75% of profits are 
taxable.
• Zero percent import duty rate on raw 
materials, capital goods, machinery 
including trucks and specialised motor 
vehicles for five years.
• Deferment of VAT on machinery 
and equipment including trucks and 
specialised motor vehicles.
MICRO AND SMALL ENTERPRISES 
In addition to general incentives, the 
following incentives are provided under 
this category
• For an enterprise in an urban area the 
income shall be exempt from tax for 
the first three years.
• For an enterprise in a rural area, the 
income shall be exempt from tax for 
the first five years.
Furthermore, the country has initiated 
several regulatory reforms for supporting the development of the power sector 
leading to the establishment in 1999 of 
the Office for Promoting Private Power 
Investment (OPPPI). The OPPPI was set up 
to be a ‘one window operation’ to reduce 
the complexity of procedures, rules and 
regulations and red tape usually associated with obtaining the required approvals, permits and licences for investors in 
the electricity sector. The mandate of the 
OPPPI is to: 
i) attract private investment in generation (for projects no less than 10 MW) 
and transmission projects;
ii) assist the private sector in working 
through bureaucracy by acting as 
one-stop-shop; 
iii) negotiate implementation agreements 
and transmission service agreements 
between the government and the project developer; and 
iv) conduct pre-feasibility and feasibility 
studies on most potential hydroelectric 
sites in Zambia. 
 Through the OPPPI, the government 
offers non-fiscal incentives which 
involve risk-sharing/allocation between 
the developer and government. 
Under the implementation agreement 
between the OPPPI and the developer, 
the former promises to share the cost 
of risk related to droughts and geological effect and to support in the acquisition of water rights and environmental 
impact assessments.
The Development Bank of Zambia is a 
development finance institution established in the early 1970s as a joint venture 
between the Government of Zambia, 
public sector financial institutions, local 
and private sector and foreign bilateral 
and multilateral institutions. The bank’s 
mandate is to provide medium- and longterm development finance and has been 
involved in the sectors of agriculture, 
mining, forestry, fishery and manufacturing. 
The bank was recently involved in supporting a 1 MW isolated small hydro mini-grid 
in Shiwang’andu (Chisali District) that was 
co-financed by GEF and UNIDO. The bank 
co-founded the project by signing a Trust Fund Agreement of USD 3.55 million with 
ZESCO for the construction of the power 
plant, which was commissioned in 2012.
Through the REA, the Zambia government 
has set up a Rural Electrification Fund 
aimed at increasing access to electricity 
in rural areas through grid extension and 
decentralised power systems. The fund is 
mainly drawn from a 3% levy on every unit 
of electricity consumed as well as grants 
and loans from development partners. It 
is aimed at encouraging private sector 
participation by financing project preparation studies and providing smart-capital 
subsidies with the intent of lowering the 
end-user tariffs or cost to access electricity. The REA, as part of its mandate, developed an operational manual7 that highlights the capital subsidy of up to 100% it 
offers for publicly-led rural electrification 
projects and can support privately-driven 
rural electrification projects for up to 50% 
of the capital costs, with remaining funds 
to be secured by the developer with a minimum level of 20% of equity, and a minimum internal rate of return of 10% before 
grants. In addition, the project proposal 
must contain enough indication allowing 
the REA to make a good assessment in 
terms of technology and expected benefits, meaning that the proposal should be 
backed by a complete business plan and 
financial studies.
A multitude of local financial services 
institutions are involved in providing 
technical assistance to project developers in structuring bankable proposals for 
small-scale renewable energy and Clean 
Development Mechanisms (CDMs). A study 
titled “Financial Sector Survey on Clean 
7 The REF Operational Manual is aimed at developinga transparent and eff ective capital subsidy scheme, project 
selection criteria based on economic and fi nancial principles, eligibility criteria and principles for capital subsidy, 
appraisal of project proposals, etc. 
Decentralised rural electrification grid 
Courtesy: READevelopment Mechanism Awareness and 
Predisposition in Zambia” revealed that 
most of the local financial institutions 
do not provide medium- to long-term 
loans. They require feasibility studies to 
be conducted at the applicant’s expense, 
since bank officials have limited knowledge in assessing renewable energy projects. In addition, banks require land titles 
as collateral, portfolios of project sponsors 
and managers, data on past and current 
operations, approximate value of existing 
investment, valuation reports, raw material 
procurement plans, and marketing strategies for the finished product. As renewable 
energy projects are relatively a new investments field, it is often difficult for the developer to provide the required information 
and track history. Another issue linked to 
the local finance of renewable energy projects is related to the interest rates. Indeed, 
a check with 12 local banks indicated that 
the interest rate for loans on investment 
projects ranged between 10% to 12% for 
foreign currency, while being subjected 
to rates between 19% to 20% for local 
currency (Zambian Kwacha). However, 
experts in the field indicated that interest 
rates actually ranged between 20% to 35% 
per annum, after considering hidden costs 
(CEEEZ, 2011).
To remove such investment barriers at 
the local level, local financial institutions’ 
capacities should be built to assess renewable energy projects to remove the high 
risk perception of the sector. In addition, 
insurance and risk mitigation mechanisms 
should be developed to reduce the risk 
profile of renewable energy projects. IV. EMERGING ISSUES IN 
 THE DEPLOYMENT OF 
 RENEWABLE ENERGY
ON-GRID ELECTRICITY
Power development in Zambia’s southern areas, near the Victoria Falls 
and in the Copperbelt areas, started when decentralised thermal generation was established to supply electricity to the burgeoning lead and 
zinc mining projects. To meet the increasing demand of the mining 
sector, which became a pillar of the country’s economy, interconnectors were built with the neighbouring DRC, while dams were developed 
along the Zambezi River (Kariba North, Kafue Gorge, and Victoria Falls) 
to supply hydroelectricity to the mines on the Copperbelt. This led to 
the development of the transmission backbone linking the dams in the 
south to the Copperbelt area in the northwest, while supplying nearby 
towns along its path.
The electricity demand in Zambia is expected to reach 3,544 MW by 
2030 in low case8 scenarios and 5,406  MW in high case9 scenarios.
However 2,390 MW of the OPPPI pipeline of projects is expected to be 
part of the SAPP to meet regional power demand, leaving the country 
with a potential power deficit of 1,000 MW in the high case scenario if 
the country is to meet this growing demand on a self-sufficiency basis 
(MEWD, 2010).
The strong reliance of the country on hydro (representing over 90% 
of the electricity mix) exposes the power system to seasonal climate 
variation known to include droughts and floods, which can greatly 
hamper hydropower generation. Although the country’s power system 
can sustain a decrease of power from the hydro schemes by up to 16% 
during dry year/season (MEWD, 2010), a higher deficit was experienced during the 1991-1992 drought with a deficit of 30% (from around 
9,000  gigawatt-hour (GWh) to 6,200  GWh) (Kapika and Eberhard, 
2013). The supply gap for that year was only met thanks to imports 
from the regional power pool. Subsequently the power system has

over the past ten years. Furthermore, a 
study on climate variability implications on 
hydroelectricity generation in the Zambezi 
River Basin10 has shown that hydroelectric 
power potential has a tendency towards 
a gradual reduction for both existing and 
proposed hydroelectric power schemes 
(Yamba et al., 2011). The study has revealed 
that seasonal climate variability will affect 
hydropower generation by reducing water 
run-off and reservoir storage capacity in 
dry years, and water overflow, which can 
affect hydropower infrastructure during 
wet years. To mitigate such risks, integration of renewable energy sources other 
than hydro in the power generation plans 
is critical to sustain future demand. For 
that to happen, the country should engage 
in a thorough renewable energy resource 
assessment process that will allow for 
the identification of sound technical and 
economic potential, which may lead to the 
development of an integrated resource 
plan that will include a high share of nonhydro renewable energy. Furthermore, as 
the country already plays a critical role in 
interconnecting SAPP countries that have 
higher electricity tariffs than Zambia, integrating other renewable energy in the 
power grid will allow the country to reinforce its position within the SAPP.
TARGET SETTING 
As mentioned earlier, the renewable 
energy strategy has defined targets for the 
deployment of renewable energy power 
generation. However, the targets have been 
set without any thorough investigation of 
the economic potential of each renewable 
energy resource considered (solar, small 
hydro, geothermal and biomass). Moreover, 
cost implication of each renewable energy 
technology as well as socio-economic 
opportunities, should be considered when 
developing targets, as there is no clarity on 
the expected share of renewable power to 
be supplied to the grid, and the implication on the latter to accommodate variable 
power. 
There is therefore a need for the Ministry 
of Mines, Energy and Water Development 
and relevant stakeholders to undertake a 
thorough study on the renewable energy 
potential (including both the technical and 
economic). This may lead to the review of 
the current targets for more realistic ones.
ENABLING ENVIRONMENT 
Major power sector reform in Zambia 
occurred in 1995 with the establishment of 
the ERB, abolishing the statutory monopoly of ZESCO and allowing the participation of other private operators in the sector. 
Despite that reform, however, the CEC and 
the LHPC remain the only private players 
in the market. The LHPC supplies power to 
ZESCO while the CEC transmits ZESCO’s 
power to the mines though a bulk supply 
agreement (BSA). Furthermore, since the 
Kariba North Dam commissioned in 1977, 
no greenfield investment has been done 
in the sector. This is due to the fact that 
the country enjoyed surplus capacity from 
the 1980s till early 2000, when electricity demand began to escalate due to the 
recovery of copper mining and the extension of ZESCO’s customer base. In recent 
years, foreign investors have expressed 
their interest in the power sector and 
have engaged with ZESCO and CEC to 
expand the country’s generation capacity. However the pipeline of projects so far 
only includes hydro and coal-based power 
plants due to their economical generation 
10 The study has analysed the eff ects of various factors on hydroelectric power generation potential to include 
climate change/variability, water demand, and installation of proposed hydroelectric power schemes in the 
Zambezi River Basin.cost that continue to reflect the country’s 
low national electricity tariffs, which are 
recognised as being among the lowest in 
the SADC region.
Tariffs in Zambia are not only unattractive 
for private sector participation, but have 
also partly hampered ZESCO’s plan to 
further expand and rehabilitate the electricity grid. In January 2011, the energy 
regulator ERB approved a 30% electricity tariff increase for the mining sector, 
although contracts signed under these 
new tariffs are still not cost-reflective, as 
they only cover about half of the cost of 
new generation capacity (hydro-based).
Through ZESCO’s 2012 business plan, it 
intends to spend USD 5.3 billion between 
2013 and 2018, raised mainly through 
external debt, to expand the electricity 
infrastructure and address the power deficit. In that regard, the company submitted 
a tariff increase proposal to the ERB with 
the objective of an average tariff increase 
of 26% across all customers. The rationale behind this tariff increase includes 
rising costs of generating, transmitting and 
distributing electricity (56% increase in 
operation costs and 59% increase in cost of 
sales between 2009 and 2011), system and 
customer base expansion, and rising costs 
of electricity imports (ERB, 2012).
A grid code is a critical element in the 
management and operation of a power 
system. As renewable energy power 
requires flexible conditions for their 
adequate integration, it is important for the 
grid code to consider options that would 
allow renewable power integration without 
affecting the grid safety and stability. The 
Zambian draft grid code, although allowing open access to the grid for IPPs, does 
not provide any guidelines or standards for 
accommodating renewable energy-based 
electricity. For instance, the current power 
forecast time is set a day ahead, which is 
not favourable for renewable energy, in 
particular wind and solar, due to their variability. Best practises show that forecasts 
are more accurate the closer they are to real 
time and sub-hourly scheduling is recommended. The Grid Code should additionally provide priority to renewable power in 
the dispatch schedule. The draft Grid Code, 
before its formal adoption, should integrate these necessary conditions to allow 
more renewable energy-based power into 
the grid. The use of forecasts requires 
operational changes, thus grid operators 
need to be made capable of integrating 
forecast data in daily operations, as well as 
the provision of the necessary tools such as 
sophisticated information and communication infrastructure for better system-wide 
decision-making. 
Another constraint in the financing of grid 
connected renewable energy power projects is the negotiation of power purchase 
agreements (PPAs). In Zambia, PPAs are 
drawn up on a case by case basis and 
have only been concluded for hydro- and 
fossil fuel-based generation. Attracting 
investment in variable renewable 
energy-based power in the grid could be 
enabled by considering important factors 
to strengthen the bankability of a PPA. 
These could comprise mitigating dispatch 
risks by including clauses that calculate 
the tariff based on the energy delivered by 
embedding a fixed charge not dependent 
on dispatch or a capacity charge along 
with charges for the energy actually delivered. This would make the PPA bankable 
by providing enhanced predictability of 
revenue stream for the plant. The country 
should therefore engage in a consultative 
process to develop a standardised PPA 
to increase the bankability of renewable 
energy power projects
Zambia relies heavily on hydro-based 
generation to meet current electricity demand and plans on developing new 
hydro and coal capacity to meet future 
demand. However, the country should tap 
its tremendous renewable energy potential 
to diversify its electricity mix as non-hydro 
renewables are increasingly becoming 
cost-competitive, provided that a conducive framework is built to allow their rapid 
deployment for power generation.
RECOMMENDATIONS 
Integrated resource planning is becoming 
an important tool that allows key stakeholders to participate in the identification 
and optimisation of the appropriate mix of 
energy resources to meet near- and longterm electricity needs in a sustainable way. 
This also enhances the security of energy 
supply by including all economically viable 
and environmentally friendly energy 
resources. 
It would be beneficial for Zambia to initiate 
a dialogue that would include all relevant 
stakeholders in the development of an 
integrated resource plan for power generation that will help guide the country in 
diversifying its electricity mix while meeting future demand. A premise to such an 
activity is the undertaking of a thorough 
renewable energy resource assessment. 
A renewable energy resource assessment can trigger a remarkable change in 
the perception of decision makers in their 
knowledge base and awareness of the 
country’s renewable potential and opportunities, thereby allowing them to make 
more informed decisions. Furthermore, 
renewable energy resource assessment is 
a fairly small investment that can leverage significant interest for private sector 
involvement and lead to cost reduction. 
Setting renewable energy targets, based 
on the resource assessment, would provide 
a realistic and achievable goal for the country’s efforts to increase renewable energy 
in its electricity mix. This would provide a 
clear policy signal to attract private sector 
investment in renewable energy, especially 
if targets have a mandatory clause for 
power generators and those who off-take 
bulk power. It would be worthy for Zambia 
to partake in this activity upon completion 
of the renewable energy resource assessment and develop a strong implementation and monitoring framework to achieve 
these targets. 
Grid integration of non-hydro renewable 
energy-based power requires a thorough 
assessment of the grid’s ability to include 
variable power. Improving a grid’s ability to include variable power entails the 
enhancement of the grid system operation 
through operational decision-making tools, 
long-term grid planning studies, meeting the requirements for renewable power 
generators and priority access to the grid 
for electricity generated from renewable 
energy. 
The revision of the Zambia draft Grid 
Code to include these elements is essential before its formal adoption if the 
country is resolved to achieve large-scale 
deployment of non-hydro renewable 
energy-based power. 
A programmatic approach for utility scale 
renewable energy power projects should 
be developed with the requisite financial 
incentives and be backed by a standardised 
bankable PPA in order to attract scalable 
investment, limit elaborate and tedious 
negotiations and give potential investors 
clear expectations on their investment.OFF-GRID RENEWABLE 
ENERGY OPTIONS
In Zambia rural electrification has been 
achieved mainly through grid extension 
by ZESCO until 2006, when the REA was 
established and put in charge of rural electrification. The first approach of the REA to 
provide rural access was through grid extension (53 grid extension projects completed 
by 2008). In addition to grid extension, the 
REMP outlined that 20% of the RGCs would 
be electrified through solar home systems 
and mini-hydro power plants11. However, 
achieving the required mobilisation for the 
grid extension component has proven to 
be a challenge, evidenced by slow progress in reaching annual targets of the REMP.
This is supported by a 2011 review of donor 
support programmes in rural electrification, which pointed out that the clustering concept of RGCs requires considerable 
technical and financial resources above the 
means of the REA (Dastgeer, et al., 2011). 
In fact, JICA, which supported the development of the REMP later recognised the 
need to repackage these concessions in 
smaller and more manageable ones that 
could attract local private sector involvement (Ibid). 
This slow progress in grid extension 
encouraged the REA to rethink its rural 
electrification approach by expanding the 
solar home systems and mini-hydro power 
systems while also exploring other renewable energy-based mini-grids (solar and 
biomass).
SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS 
In 2008 a solar photovoltaic (PV) system 
component was developed under the 
World Bank Increased Access to Electricity 
Services (IAES) with a financial allocation of USD  9  million. The project aimed 
to aggregately install solar PV systems 
in social infrastructures such as schools, 
health centers and palaces, as well as 
in rural enterprises and households, to 
achieve commercial viability through economies of scale. As of February 2013, 199 
households and 264 social infrastructures 
were provided electricity through solar PV 
systems. The target for this programme 
was to install 10,000 solar home systems 
and 450 solar PV panels for institutions by 
the end of 2013. 
Other development partners such as the 
Swedish Development Agency (SIDA) 
and the Dutch International Cooperation 
Agency (DGIS) also provided financial 
assistance for similar activities. However, 
this approach in Zambia has evidently had 
a poor implementation track record, as 
the sector relies on donor-driven distribution of free or highly subsidised solar PV 
systems. Although solar PV systems are 
a practical option for meeting part of the 
electricity needs of populations in remote 
areas, they often face major maintenance 
issues throughout their lifecycle due to 
the lack of local skills and ownership from 
the beneficiaries. For a more sustainable 
and successful solar PV programme, the 
REA should aim for a long-term delivery 
approach on a commercial basis by involving the private sector, especially entrepreneurs, throughout the supply chain, as well 
as micro-finance institutions, to provide 
end-user finance for the uptake of these 
systems. Price discovery by REA through 
a mechanism of aggregating the demand, 
coupled with strong technical evaluation of the equipment and capacity of the 
vendors, could facilitate this process by 
reducing costs of the systems and allow for 
the commercial viability of standalone PV 
systems.
11 Although many potential mini-hydro sites exist in Zambia, only three sites (Mujila Falls Lower, Upper Zambezi, 
and West Lunga in North-Western Province) were fi nancially feasible.RENEWABLE ENERGY MINI-GRIDS 
Zambia has a wealth of experience with 
the development of isolated mini-grids 
running on different energy resources and 
ownership structures. ZESCO is operating eight diesel mini-grids of various sizes 
totalling an installed capacity of 8  MW. 
These diesel mini-grids cost the utility 
between USD 0.35 to USD 0.40 per unit of 
power generated and with current tariffs 
set at USD 0.065 per kWh, they are running 
deficits. Given the fact that some of these 
isolated mini-grids are located along 
perennial rivers or in areas with favourable 
solar radiation, ZESCO is planning in the 
medium- to long-term to either hybridise or 
replace these mini-grids with hydro or solar 
plants as well as develop Greenfield hydro 
and solar mini-grids. In order to demonstrate the technical and economic viability 
of renewable energy based mini-grids, the 
utility recently completed a 1  MW small 
hydro mini-grid in Shiwang’andu (Northern 
Province) financed through a GEF/UNIDO 
grant and a trust fund agreement with the 
Development Bank of Zambia for a total 
amount of USD 4.5 million12. Through the 
same GEF/UNIDO project the REA was 
able to develop the first solar PV mini-grid 
in the country with an installed capacity of 60  kW in Samfya District (Luapula 
Province) through a loan facility agreement signed with the Development Bank 
of Zambia. 
Furthermore, several hydro mini-grids 
have been established in the country by a 
range of stakeholders including Zengamina 
Power Limited, which owns and operates 
12 No details on the business model and the tariff structure of the project were made available.

with a grid covering 35  km in the NorthWestern Province, in addition to many 
mini-hydro plants (of less than 100  kW 
capacity) owned and operated by communities including resident cooperatives and 
missionaries. 
A feasibility study commissioned by the 
REA was performed for a 1  MW hydro 
scheme in Chilinga (Eastern Province) that 
provided some interesting insights regarding the economics of small hydro mini-grids 
and could be further investigated for other 
available renewable energy sources such 
as solar and biomass. The Chilinga study 
compared three electrification scenarios 
including grid extension and decentralised generation using either diesel or small 
hydro13. The least cost financial analysis 
of the study showed that although grid 
extension is generally perceived as being 
the least costly option for rural electrification in Zambia, the distance of the site to 
be electrified from the closest sub-station 
made it financially unattractive. Similarly, 
when comparing the economics of a 
diesel-based generation plant to a small 
hydro plant, the study showed that the 
high operating cost of the diesel scheme 
due to high fuel prices was also not financially attractive (Table 5).
Furthermore, a financial/sensitivity analysis 
was performed using the UNIDO COMFAR 
model14 with prices ranging between from 
Figure 8
Internal Rate of Return against Tariff s
Source: (REA, 2008)
13 Assumptions used for the fi nancial analysis are: capital cost for grid extension (132  kV line) 
USD 100,000 per kilometre; capital cost for diesel is USD 500 per kW; diesel price is USD 1.2 per litre (now USD 1.65 
after removal of subsidies) and tariff assumed at USD 0.10 per kWh
14 The UNIDO COMFAR is an internationally recognised computer model for feasibility analysis and reporting that 
provides comprehensive data on working capital requirements, income statements, cash fl ow and balance sheet. In 
addition it calculates internal rate of return, NPV and payback period.
Business as usual Business as usual Smart subsidy (50% down payment) USD 0.02 to USD0.16 per kWh of electricity produced. As it was assumed that the 
loan portion of the capital costs of the 
projects will be obtained from international 
markets, an interest rate of 8% and discount 
rate of 12% with a debt/equity ratio of 20% 
equity and 80% debt was applied. In the 
Business As Usual scenario, implying that 
all capital expenditure will be borne by 
the private entity, the project would pay 
back in eight years for cost reflective tariffs 
between USD 0.15 to USD 0.16 per kWh. As 
mentioned earlier, the REA could contribute to private sector led rural electrification 
projects by providing up to 50% capital 
subsidy to the project developer and when 
applied the project would pay back in six 
years with tariffs between USD  0.08 to 
USD 0.10 per kWh (Figure 8).
Another feasibility study was commissioned by the REA for a small-sized biomass 
power generation plant of about 4  MW 
around the Lamba National Forest and 
the Emerald Mining Areas. It is estimated 
that the number of people in the area 
was around 10,000 with a possible initial 
connection of between 900-1,000 households, schools, clinics and commercial and 
industrial facilities. The power generation is 
envisaged to meet the total electric demand 
in the project area, with surplus sales to 
ZESCO. The investment cost for the plant 
was estimated at USD 10.928 million with 
operation and maintenance (O&M) costs 
of USD 96,000 per annum. Without capital 
subsidy the financial analysis indicated a 
cost reflective tariff of USD 0.073 per kWh 
with an internal rate of return of 12.5%. 
This tariff is favourable and compares well 
with current on-grid electricity tariffs of 
USD 0.065 by ZESCO. This project would 
become even more economically sound 
for investors and make electricity tariffs 
affordable for rural populations when 
considering the fact that the REA could 
provide a capital subsidy of up to 50%. 
Moreover another analysis completed for 
a typical remote rural village with about 
2,000 inhabitants, showed that similar 
sites throughout the country could be best 
electrified in an economically viable way 
by considering various renewable based 
mini-grids. The study demonstrated that 
each technology becomes economically 
viable as grid extension reaches a certain 
threshold, known as the Economical

SOLAR WATER HEATING
As part of its demand side management 
plan, ZESCO intends on pursuing projects 
that include free energy audits and advice 
for power factor correction (PFC) and time 
of use tariff (ToU) to maximum demand 
customers in industry and commerce, as 
well as distribute compact fluorescent 
lamps (CFLs), and install prepayment 
meters in residential and commercial 
customers, power alert systems and ripple 
control system of electric water heaters. 
In addition, ZESCO plans on deploying 
350,000 solar water heaters in order to 
save 40% of domestic electricity demand 
corresponding to 150 MW that is attributed 
to the use of electric water heaters. This 
would help by shaving the morning and 
evening electricity demand peak estimated 
around 1,480  MW and 1,630  MW in 2011 
(Figure 9). The proper implementation of 
this initiative would reduce load shedding, 
which currently costs the utility around 
USD  6.1  million  per  year, and will reduce 
electricity import from SAPP to meet peak 
hour demand. The first phase of the project 
seeks to install 100,000 solar water heaters 
with an initial investment of USD 40 million 
and is expected to save ZESCO about 
USD  180  million over the lifespan of the 
Figure 9
Reduced Electricity Demand from the Installation of Solar Water Heaters
Source: (REA, 2008)solar water heaters, which is estimated at 
15 years with a payback period of 3 years 
(ZESCO, 2011). The project is designed in a 
way that the end-user would not contribute to any of the installation costs of the 
systems, as the utility plans on bearing all 
initial costs. 
However, as of today, except for the initial 
solar water heaters disseminated as pilots 
in the Lusaka area (less than 100 systems), 
the project has been stagnant with no 
further roll out of these systems.
Despite the slow progress in the implementation of the solar water heater project, 
ZESCO is to be commended for taking such 
an initiative. However, the current business 
model of the project will make it extremely 
difficult for the utility to deploy the intended 
number of solar water heaters and realise 
the expected electricity savings. Therefore 
fundamental measures need to be taken to 
create strong a programme with a sound 
business model that will lead to the large 
uptake of solar water heaters in the country. One of the most successful solar water 
heater dissemination programmes in Africa 
is the Tunisian PROSOL, started in 2005 by 
the Ministry for Industry, Energy and Small 
and Medium Enterprises and the National 
Agency for Energy Conservation (ANME) 
with the support from the United Nations 
Environment Programme (UNEP). 
Figure 10
Tunisian PROSOL Business Model
Source: (REA, 2008)The objective of PROSOL was to stimulate 
uptake of solar water heaters to replace 
Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG)-fired boilers and electric water heaters, thereby 
reducing the country’s reliance on LPG 
imports. The success of PROSOL was due 
in part to its innovative business model 
and the active participation of all of relevant actors in the sector, especially local 
financial institutions. The main local actors 
involved in the design and implementation 
of the programme were the national utility 
STEG (Tunisian Company of Electricity and 
Gas), the ANME, local commercial bank 
Attijari Bank, local suppliers (importers 
and manufacturers) and installers, as well 
as the renewable energy association. The 
business model was designed in a way that 
solar water heater suppliers accredited by 
the ANME (which developed a series of 
technical requirements and performance 
standards of solar water heaters), would 
act as indirect lenders to the utility customers who enter an agreement with both the 
suppliers and the utility, committing themselves to pay back the loan over a five-year 
period through their electricity bill after 
an initial 10% down payment. Finally the 
bank dealt directly with both the suppliers 
and the utility by opening a credit line for 
the utility and paying the suppliers in full 
upon satisfactory installation of the SWHs. 
This arrangement allowed for a risk mitigation scheme as the customers could see 
their electricity suspended in case of nonpayment of their bill while the utility acted 
as a guarantor to the customer’s loan. The 
model is presented in Figure 10.
It is important to note that prior to the 
PROSOL there were seldom any incentives that would favor the uptake of solar 
water heaters in Tunisia, especially with 
the presence of 50% subsidy in the LPG 
sector. Moreover the dissemination of 
solar water heaters was conducted with 
no involvement of the private sector and 
no robust quality control system. PROSOL 
allows for the establishment of a self-sustaining market for solar water heaters and 
the setting up of accompanying policy 
and regulatory instruments to create an 
enabling environment as well as reducing 
the commercial lending rate for solar water 
heaters by half. 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
Zambia aims at to increase access to electricity for its rural population through a 
wide range of solutions where renewable 
energy plays a critical role. Two of the solutions considered by all stakeholders in the 
sector include the dissemination of solar 
PV systems and the setting up of decentralised renewable energy mini-grids. 
However, much more needs to be done 
to scale up the deployment of these technologies. The relatively small size of the 
off-grid market and poor affordability for 
end-users does not make it substantially 
attractive to foreign investors, which is why 
the sector has mainly involved local private 
operators with the support of donors 
and development partners. Local private 
operators face technical and financial 
constraints that include lack of technical 
expertise to develop bankable proposals, 
insufficient working capital due to difficult 
access to loans, high interest rates due to 
high risk perception and lack of expertise 
from local financial institutions in appraising off-grid renewable energy proposals. Therefore local private operators and 
financial institutions’ capacity to develop 
and appraise bankable renewable energy 
project proposals should be built.
The country’s objective of increasing rural 
access to electricity would be facilitated 
by creating a level playing field for local 
private sector involvement. On the one 
hand, the support provided by the OPPPI 
to power project developers (with projects greater than 10 MW), which includes acquisition of water rights, licenses and permits, 
facilitation and technical support in environmental impact assessments (EIAs), 
should be extended to small-scale decentralised renewable energy mini-grids (of a 
size less than 10 MW). On the other hand, 
the rural electrification approach should 
cater to commercially oriented sustainable electricity service delivery by providing performance and matching grants, in 
additon to technical assistance for private 
sector led project proposals. 
As affordability of electricity is a key issue 
in rural Zambia, options to facilitate end 
user access to electricity services shouldinclude targeted subsidies and deferred 
payments schemes that could be prefinanced directly by the service providers 
or through a micro-finance institution. A 
sound business model should be developed for both stand-alone systems and 
mini-grids to increase viability and sustainability of decentralised renewable energy 
projects and access to electricity services 
in rural Zambia. 
As ZESCO has clearly expressed willingness to deploy solar water heaters, a 
programme could be developed involving all relevant stakeholders (MMEWD, 
ZBS, ZDA and energy service companies). Such a programme would include 
capacity-building for all stakeholders 
(policy makers, financial institutions, suppliers, installers and others) and would lead 
to the development and enactment of 
supportive policies and measures (including setting up mandatory quotas for different categories of end users, inclusion of 
solar water heaters in the building codes, 
financial and fiscal incentives). It would 
also bring about an effective communication strategy including an awareness raising campaign aimed at customers and 
financial institutions, and strong quality 
control comprising the setting up of solar 
water heater standards and a certification scheme for installers to ensure proper 
operation and maintenance. 
BIOFUELS
Zambia imports all of the petroleum it 
requires in the form of spiked crude oil, 
transported through the TAZAMA Pipeline 
and refined at the Indeni Petroleum 
Refinery in Ndola in the Copperbelt 
Province. Petroleum contributes to about 
9% of the national total energy requirement 
as it plays a crucial role in the country’s key 
economic activities that includes mining, 
agriculture and transport (ZDA, 2013). Due 
to economic growth, the country’s petroleum consumption increased rapidly in 
recent years, reaching an average monthly 
consumption of about 52  million  litres in 
2009 and is projected to grow at around 
40% per annum (Ibid). The country’s reliance on imported fuel, subjected to price 
volatility, to sustain its economic activities 
has prompted consideration of alternative 
solutions. The country’s suitable climate, 
vast arable land and abundance of fresh 
water resources has stimulated the promotion of the cultivation energy crops for 
biofuel production with the dual vision of 
reaching the agricultural reform targets 
and reducing the dependency on imported 
oil.
A large programme for the promotion of 
biofuels was initiated following the adoption of the NEP, which provides for the use 
of biofuels as a source of modern energy 
through its integration in the transport 
industry. In that regard, statutory instruments legalising biofuels, standards and 
regulatory framework on biodiesel and 
pricing methodologies were developed. 
Institutionally, the Biofuels Association 
of Zambia, the Civil Society Biofuels 
Association and District and provin-cial biofuels farmers associations have 
all been formed. In order to enhance the 
biofuels sector the government is intending to declare it a priority sector so that 
investors can benefit from the appropriate 
incentives.
Furthermore, blending ratios for bioethanol and bio-diesel have been set at 
10%  (E10) and 5%  (B5) for ethanol and 
biodiesel respectively. A land zoning exercise was completed with support from 
the Government of Brazil under a MoU 
signed between the two governments. 
The study looked at appropriate zones for 
the development of energy feedstocks, 
including: cotton, peanut, rice, sugarcane, 
elephant grass, eucalyptus, bean crop, 
sunflower, jatropha, caster beans, manioc, 
corn, African oil palm and soy. The study 
concluded that sugarcane for ethanol 
production may be the only viable solution for biofuel production, with a potential 
ethanol production of 127 million litres per 
year for 72,000  tonnes of sugar per year 
for a total cultivated area of 200  km2 
and would require a capital investment 
of USD  471.5  million with an internal rate 
of return of 22%. (FGV PROJETOS, 2013). 
Currently, there are two major sugar plants, 
namely Nakambala Sugar and Kafue Sugar, 
producing an estimated 400,000  tonnes 
and 20,000 tonnes of sugar, respectively. 
Their combined molasses waste can 
produce an estimated 40 million litres per 
annum. If implemented, this figure can 
contribute to Zambia’s ethanol demand at 
the recommended 10% blending. 
Despite the initial enthusiasm for biofuels, 
the sector has performed poorly due to 
many factors including, but not limited to 
the following: 
 lack of systematic research on feedstocks oil yield, especially in the case 
of jatropha 
Biofuel crops in rural Zambia
Courtesy: REA lack of coordination on the supply side 
(farmers are dispersed and operate 
individually)
 land issues and impacts on surrounding communities
 high cost of doing business due to 
difficult access to concessionary funds
 lack of appropriate delivery infrastructure at the national level including storage infrastructure, blending infrastructure at pump stations 
 lack of interest to invest in blending 
facilities by the local oil marketing 
companies (OMCs) 
 lack of adequate infrastructure 
to deliver the product to market, 
combined with the difficult access 
to the foreign markets (namely 
European Union markets) due to trade 
restrictions
RECOMMENDATIONS 
As the local market for biofuels is still to 
be established and accessing international 
markets has proven to be difficult, there 
can be some benefit from a review of the 
biofuel strategy and the development of 
sustainability criteria for biofuel productionto open the international market.
Research and development in the biofuels sector is paramount to ensuring sound 
development of its value chain. Funding 
should be made available for local research 
institutions to conduct further assessment 
of economically feasible energy crops, 
experimentation on cost effective ways to 
improve the oil yield ratios and disseminate 
lessons learnt and establish best practises 
for contracting out grower farmers and 
large-scale plantation owners.
OPPORTUNITIES AND 
CONSTRAINTS FOR 
SCALING UP RENEWABLE 
ENERGY DEPLOYMENT
OPPORTUNITIES
Zambia is a credible democratic country 
and hence is an attractive destination for 
investment. The country is putting in place 
some conducive policies, strategies, laws 
and regulatory and institutional frameworks to promote RE, although strengthening is required to achieve the desired 
results. The energy sector is liberalised 
to some extent with participation of the 
private sector, albeit small. The government is moving towards a study on RE feed 
in tariffs and determination of long run 
marginal costs, both of which can assist in 
determining cost-reflective tariffs for electricity. The movement to rationalise PPAs 
and approve of an open grid system will 
also be attractive to potential private investors and energy off-takers. The ambitious 
targets set for access to modern energy, 
particularly electricity, are a strong sign of 
the government’s support for the energy 
sector, which is expected to have a positive 
response from the investor community.
At the regional level there is a strong 
movement to embrace non-hydro renewable energy, as countries in the SAPP have 
started to determine their grid capacity to 
accommodate renewable energy and policies to import renewable energy-based 
electricity, as can be seen in South Africa. 
The regional grid continues to be strengthened to enable sharing of electricity in the 
region. Given Zambia’s ample solar, wind 
and geothermal resources and its central 
position in the SAPP, the country could 
play a leading role in expanding nonhydro renewable energy in both the SAPP 
and Eastern African Power Pool (EAPP) 
(through Tanzania). The country would therefore greatly benefit from the African Clean Energy Corridor 
Initiative being developed by IRENA that 
aims to harness the renewable energy 
potential of countries in the SAPP and 
EAPP by engaging stakeholders in the 
planning and zoning, creating the enabling 
environment to upscale the deployment of 
renewable energy in cross-border electricity trade. The country could further benefit 
from the Mini-Grid Policy Toolkit currently 
being developed by the European Union 
Energy Initiative Partnership Dialogue 
Facility/ Renewable Energy Co-operation 
Programme (RECP), 
in partnership with the Renewable Energy 
Network for the 21st Century (REN21) and 
the Alliance for Rural Electrification (ARE). 
This toolkit is aimed at building awareness 
of the potential and applicability of renewable energy mini-grids to policy and decision makers in order to improve the policy 
and regulatory framework to upscale minigrid deployment.
CONSTRAINTS
The major constraint remains as investment, which is negatively affected by 
the non-cost reflective tariffs and limited 
incentives to invest in renewable energy. 
The high costs of capital also limit local 
investors who could venture into renewable energy investment. 
New potential investors also lack the 
capacity to develop bankable projects that 
can attract funding. Innovative financing 
mechanisms to buy down cost of capital 
and risks are thus needed to enable the 
growth of renewable energy in Zambia.
Poverty is also still rampant in Zambia, 
limiting the majority of its population from 
access to clean renewable energy, due to 
lack of affordability. 
The off-grid market that can benefit the 
majority is driven by non-mainstream 
investors and is often supported by short 
term donor support, which means that 
projects rarely survive after donor support 
ends.
Reaching Zambia’s widespread communities in an effort to reach energy access 
targets will require substantial investment 
in distribution networks, 
in addition to generation and transmission capacity. Zambia used to benefit from 
support for ‘least developed countries’ 
(LDCs) but has now moved away from the 
LDC group and hence does not qualify for 
some sources of funding that very poor 
nations can avail,such as debt relief.V. SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

 RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
The RRA process identified and recommended the actions below. These are not given 
in any order of priority, and the list of action points from a rapid assessment is unlikely 
to be exhaustive. But these actions could improve Zambia's readiness to scale up its 
renewables deployment. They are designed to be taken in the short- to mediumterm, largely through decisions made by the Government of Zambia.
Action 1: Develop integrated resource planning for all 
 renewable sources 
Action Development of integrated resource planning that considers 
all renewable energy sources
Resource-service pair(s) On-grid electricity involving all renewable energy (biomass, 
geothermal, hydro, solar and wind) 
Description Zambia’s electricity supply mix is overwhelmingly hydrobased, at 99.9%, making the country vulnerable to any climate 
hazard, such as droughts, floods, etc. Further, electricity 
demand in Zambia is projected to increase at 4% per annum. 
This will lead to exhaustion of electricity potential, estimated 
at 6,000 MW in the year 2030. 
 Integrated resource planning is becoming an important tool 
that allows key stakeholders to participate in the identification 
and optimisation of the appropriate mix of energy resources 
to meet near- and long-term electricity needs in a sustainable way. This also enhances the security of energy supply by 
including all economically viable and environmentally friendly 
energy resources. 
 It is important for Zambia to initiate a dialogue that would 
include all relevant stakeholders in the development of an 
integrated resource plan for power generation that will help 
guide the country in diversifying its electricity mix while 
meeting future demand. A premise to such an activity is the 
undertaking of a thorough renewable energy resource assessment. A renewable energy resource assessment can trigger 
a remarkable change in decision makers’ perceptions, knowledge base and awareness of the country’s renewable potential and opportunities, thereby allowing them to make more 
informed decisions.
Stakeholders Ministry of Mines Energy and Water Development; Ministry 
of Agriculture and Livestock; Ministry of Finance; Energy 
Regulation Board; Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation 
(ZESCO); other relevant stakeholders
Timing 18 months
Keys for success Leadership of the Ministry of Mines Energy and Water 
Development and broad consultations with all relevant 
stakeholders
Action 2: Revise approach to setting renewable energy targets
Action Revision of renewable energy policy and the strategy employed 
to set renewable energy targets
Resource-service pair(s) All applications
Description Zambia’s renewable energy strategy stipulates defined targets 
for the deployment of renewable energy power generation. 
However, these targets have been set without any thorough 
investigation of the economic potential of each renewable 
energy resource considered (solar, small hydro, geothermal 
and biomass). Moreover, cost implications of each renewable 
energy technology, as well as socio-economic opportunities, 
were not considered when developing targets. Moreover, 
there is no clarity on the expected share of renewable power 
to be supplied to the grid, nor on how the grid will be adapted 
to accommodate variable power. 
 There is therefore a need for the Ministry of Mines, Energy and 
Water Development and relevant stakeholders to undertake a 
thorough study of renewable energy potential (including both 
technical and economic). This may lead to the review of the 
current targets for more realistic and achievable ones. 
 This would provide a clear policy signal to attract privatesector investment in renewable energy, especially if the 
targets include a mandatory clause for power generators 
and those who off-take bulk power. It would be worthwhile 
for Zambia to undertake target revision upon completion of 
the renewable energy resource assessment, and to develop a 
strong implementation and monitoring framework to achieve 
the revised targets. Stakeholders Ministry of Mines, Energy and Water Development; Ministry of 
Finance; Energy Regulation Board; ZESCO; Rural Electrification 
Authority; other relevant stakeholders 
Timing 18 months 
Keys for success Leadership from the Ministry of Mines, Energy and Water 
Development and broader consultations with all relevant 
stakeholders.
Action 3: Revise and adopt the draft Grid Code, including 
 renewable power provisions
Action Revision and adoption of the draft Zambia Grid Code, including its provisions and conditions for renewable energy-based 
power
Resource-service pair(s) For on grid-electricity generation
Description A grid code is a critical element in the management and operation of a power system. As renewable-energy power requires 
flexible conditions for its adequate integration, the grid code 
must incorporate options that would allow renewable power 
integration without affecting grid safety and stability. The 
draft Zambian Grid Code, although allowing open access to 
the grid for Independent Power Producers, does not provide 
any guidelines or standards for accommodating renewable 
energy-based electricity. For instance, the current power 
forecast time is set a day ahead, which is not favourable for 
renewable energy types, particularly wind and solar, due to 
their variability. Best practises show that forecasts are more 
accurate the closer they are to real time, and sub-hourly 
scheduling is recommended. The Grid Code should additionally provide priority to renewable power in the dispatch schedule. The draft Grid Code, before its formal adoption, should 
integrate these necessary conditions to allow more renewable 
energy-based power on the grid. The use of forecasts requires 
operational changes, with grid operators being enabled to 
integrate forecast data in daily operations and equipped 
with the necessary tools, such as sophisticated information 
and communication infrastructure, for better system-wide 
decision-making. Stakeholders Ministry of Mines, Energy and Water Development; Energy 
Regulation Board; ZESCO; Independent Power Producers; 
Office for Promoting Private Power Investment; others
Timing Up to 12 months 
Keys for success The Ministry of Mines, Energy and Water development 
should lead the revision and fast track the formal adoption of the Zambian Grid Code in consultation with relevant 
stakeholders 
Action 4: Develop policies and regulations for private-sector 
 involvement in decentralised renewable technologies
Action Development of lighter-handed policies and a regulatory 
framework to facilitate private-sector involvement in decentralised renewable energy technologies
Resource-service pair(s) Off-grid electricity 
Description The rural electrification rate in Zambia is relatively low, estimated at 4%. Current efforts to increase rural electricity 
access focus on grid extension. The country’s objective of 
increasing rural access to electricity would be facilitated by 
creating a level playing field for local private-sector involvement. Furthermore, the support provided by the OPPPI to 
power project developers (with projects greater than 10 MW), 
which includes acquisition of water rights, licenses and 
permits, facilitation and technical support in environmental 
impact assessments (EIAs), should be extended to small-scale 
decentralised renewable energy mini-grids (of a size less than 
10 MW). 
Stakeholders Rural Electrification Authority; Energy Regulation Board; 
Ministry of Mines, Energy and Water Development; Ministry of 
Finance; Ministry of Local Government and Housing
Timing 18 months 
Keys for success Involvement of all stakeholdersAction 5: Develop utility-scale renewable power projects 
 with a bankable purchase agreement
Action Development of a programmatic approach for utility-scale 
renewable-energy power projects with the requisite financial 
incentives that is backed by a standardised, bankable powerpurchase agreement.
Resource-service pair(s) On-grid electricity
Description In Zambia, power-purchase agreements are drawn up on a 
case by case basis and have only been concluded for hydroand fossil fuel-based generation. Attracting investment in 
variable renewable energy-based power for the grid could 
be enabled by considering important factors to strengthen 
the bankability of a power-purchase agreement. These could 
include mitigating dispatch risks, through clauses for calculating the tariff based on the energy delivered, by embedding 
either a fixed charge not dependent on dispatch, or a capacity 
charge along with charges for the energy actually delivered. 
This would make the power-purchase agreement bankable by 
providing enhanced predictability of revenue streams for each 
power plant. 
 A programmatic approach for utility-scale renewable-energy 
power projects would have to include the requisite financial 
incentives and be backed by a standardised, bankable powerpurchase agreement, in order to attract scalable investment, 
limit elaborate and tedious negotiations, and give potential 
investors clear expectations on their investment.

Timing Up to 18 months
Keys for success Engagement of the Ministry of Mines, Energy and Water 
Development with all relevant stakeholders in a consultative 
process to develop a standardised power-purchase agreement to increase the bankability of renewable-energy power 
projects Action 6: Establish business models for private-sector 
 off -grid renewable energy
Action Establishment of tailored business models for greater involvement of the private sector in promoting off-grid renewable 
energy systems
Resource-service pair(s) Off-grid all applications
Description The country’s objective of increasing rural access to electricity would be facilitated by creating a level playing field 
for local private-sector involvement. On the one hand, 
the support provided by the Office for Promoting Private 
Power Investments to power project developers (with projects greater than 10  MW), which includes acquisition of 
water rights, licenses and permits, facilitation and technical 
support in environmental impact assessments (EIAs), should 
be extended to small-scale decentralised renewable energy 
mini-grids (of a size less than 10 MW). On the other hand, the 
rural electrification approach should cater to commercially 
oriented sustainable electricity service delivery, by providing 
performance and matching grants as well as technical assistance to private sector-led project proposals. 
 As affordability of electricity is a key issue in rural Zambia, 
options to facilitate end-user access to electricity services 
should include targeted subsidies and deferred payments 
schemes that could be pre-financed directly by the service 
providers or through a micro-finance institution. A sound 
business model should be developed for both stand-alone 
systems and mini-grids to increase the viability and sustainability of decentralised renewable energy projects and access 
to electricity services in rural Zambia.

Keys for success Engagement of all stakeholders, in particular the Rural 
Electrification Authority Action 7: Build capacity for renewable energy deployment
Action Capacity-building initiatives to support renewable energy 
deployment
Resource-service pair(s) All applications
Description The relatively small size of the off-grid market and poor affordability for end-users does not make it substantially attractive 
to foreign investors, which is why the sector has largely only 
attracted local private operators, with the support of donors 
and development partners. Local private operators face technical and financial constraints that include lack of technical 
expertise to develop bankable proposals, insufficient working capital due to difficult access to loans, high interest rates 
due to high risk perception, and lack of expertise from local 
financial institutions in appraising off-grid renewable energy 
proposals. Therefore,the capacity of local private operators 
and financial institutions to develop and appraise bankable 
renewable energy project proposals should be built. 
 Capacity building for all stakeholders (policy makers, financial 
institutions, suppliers, installers and others) has to be accompanied by the development and enactment of supportive policies and measures (including setting up mandatory quotas 
for different categories of end users, inclusion of solar water 
heaters in the building codes, financial and fiscal incentives). 
Such initiatives must also involve an effective communication strategy, including an awareness-raising campaign aimed 
at customers and financial institutions, and strong quality 
control, including setting up solar water heater standards and 
a certification scheme for installers to ensure proper operation and maintenance.

Keys for success Engagement of all stakeholders and goodwill from financial

 for feedstock optimisation and biofuel production
Action Development of a comprehensive framework, including 
sustainability criteria, and encourage research and development for feedstock optimisation and biofuel production
Resources-service pair(s) Biofuels 
Description Zambia, due to its suitable climatic and soil conditions, has a 
wide variety of crops suitable for bioenergy production. With 
large areas of currently unutilised arable land, Zambia is strategically positioned as a country with enormous potential for 
biofuel production. Of great importance is the need to address 
sustainability and cost-effectiveness issues. Sustainability of 
feedstock production requires assessment of land availability 
and suitability, which takes account of land requirements for 
food production and biodiversity.
 Another important requirement is the development of standards and regulations for the biofuels industry. In the last few 
years, good progress has been made in the promotion of the 
biofuels industry in the country. The biofuels industry has been 
added to a list of priority industries to benefit from incentives 
through the Zambia Development Agency. At the regulatory 
level, trade in biofuels has been permitted, while ethanol and 
biodiesel standards are now available. 
 However, some issues still need attention, including financing, 
cost-effectiveness, sustainability, transportation, storage and
