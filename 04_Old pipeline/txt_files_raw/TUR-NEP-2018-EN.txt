We are going through an era in which radical changes are occurring in energy, storage, production, and consumption profiles 
based on renewable and hydrocarbon resources and energy market is redesigned.
Increased geopolitical risks and turbulences witnessed in the regions with dense energy resources oblige energy projections 
which are long-term and free from periodic developments to be brought into action urgently for all countries. In this context, by 
means of the introduced “National Energy and Mining Policy”, we lay the foundations of long-term energy policies aiming at the 
efficient use of our domestic resources. The most basic goal of our strategy, which we build upon three basic pillars; namely supply security, increased use of local resources and foreseeable markets, is to launch initiatives that ensure our domestic resources 
to be used at maximum efficiency by reducing import dependence in energy.
We have gained speed on the work we realized with the motto of “More Domestic, More Renewable” for supplying continuous, uninterrupted, accessible and cost effective energy. We force the pace on investments that ensure our energy supply security such 
as setting up a well-developed storage infrastructure of natural gas, increasing electricity generation from domestic and renewable resources, incorporating nuclear energy into our energy portfolio, putting into operation of new global petroleum and natural 
gas pipelines and projecting alternative energy resources. In addition to meeting the growing demand, we have also commenced 
investments that will turn Turkey into regional production base in this sector by improving domestic production possibilities based 
on research-development and innovation in energy technology. While increasing the investments in energy and mining sector 
with transparent, investor-friendly and foreseeable market conditions, we will ensure that Turkey becomes a main energy center 
having a developed energy infrastructure where energy is priced in international arena, market development is directed and vendors and purchasers come together under free market conditions.
One of the topics we focused on in National Energy and Mining Policy is energy efficiency. Reducing energy intensity is targeted at 
both sectoral and macro levels by increasing efficiency from production to final consumption in all processes. Energy saving and 
energy efficiency have direct effects on aspects such as ensuring supply security, decreasing the risks of energy import dependence, competitiveness, protection of the environment and climate change.
The primary energy intensity of our country is 0.12 tons of oil equivalent (toe) per 1.000 USD at 2010 prices (USD). This number 
ilththld f 018hit ihihthOECD f 011 d EU (28 b) f 009In this context, first National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (2017-2023) was prepared as a result of the meticulous work with 
our Ministry and its partners, accepted by the High Planning Council and issued in the Official Gazette. The Action Plan includes 
actions to be taken to reach the national goals as well as impacts of these actions.
The Action Plan was prepared in conformity with principles in our target policy documents, such as our 2023 goals, Energy 
Efficiency Strategy Paper issued in 2012, 2015-2019 Strategic Plan of our Ministry, 10th Development Plan and Medium-Term 
Plan, by reflecting best practices in the world.
On the other hand, the EU’s Energy Efficiency Directive of 2012/27/EU requires member states to prepare national energy efficiency 
action plan and renew by reviewing once every three years periodically. The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan was prepared 
in compliance with the template set in EU directive which allows for comparing and monitoring studies with the EU countries.
The Action Plan contains 55 actions defined under 6 categories namely buildings and services, energy, transport, industry and 
technology, agriculture and cross-cutting (horizontal) areas. The Action Plan encompassing technological, economic, social and 
environmental aspects, took into consideration innovative and best practices, prioritizes participation, joint management and was 
prepared pursuant to principles of efficiency and effectiveness as well as resource efficiency. The Action Plan has been developed 
in a structure that can be updated according to flexible, measurable and changing conditions being open to process and method 
innovation.
Expected energy savings is 23.9 MTEP cumulatively by investing 10.9 billion USD by 2023. This saving is equal to decreasing 
primary energy consumption of Turkey by 14 % in 2023 compared to the base usual scenario. Expected savings by 2033 is 30.2 
billion USD.
The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan must be fulfilled with rigorous follow-up along with focused and high-quality implementation so that it could contribute to economic, social and technological development of our country. I strongly believe that the 
implementation of the Action Plan in line with the principles of transparency and accountability under our coordination will deliver 
beneficial outputs for our country extending to the upcoming decades.1INTRODUCTION Energy efficiency is an area that complements and cross-cuts such national strategic goals as easing the burden of energy 
costs on the economy, ensuring energy supply security, alleviating risks arising from external dependency, transition to lowcarbon economy and protection of environment. The increased importance of sustainable development increases also the 
value of efforts in energy efficiency. This moves all countries towards improving energy efficiency and accelerates resolute 
action to that end.
The energy consumption in our country increases faster than in developed countries on account of such reasons as population 
growth, rising prosperity, strengthening service sector and industrialisation. The primary energy consumption reached 129.7 
mtoe in 2015, representing an increase of 46% compared to 2005. With the import rate of 75.9% in 2015 in energy resources 
for primary energy supply, our country is in the category of high external-dependency countries. 
Premised on the mission to utilise energy and natural resources efficiently and environment-friendly to make the highest 
contribution to the national prosperity, and the vision to build a secure future in energy and natural resources, our country aims 
to increase efficiency in all processes from energy generation to end-use consumption.
In this context, the Energy Efficiency Law adopted in 2007 started a new transformation process. The Energy Efficiency Strategy 
issued in 2012 set energy efficiency goals for 2023, and the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan was formulated for effective 
implementation and monitoring.
Formulated in consideration of our country’s current needs and good practices in the world, the National Energy Efficiency Action 
Plan lays down the implementation steps, key performance indicators, how to implement, outputs and potential impact. Since 
energy efficiency is a multi-disciplinary area cross-cutting many sectors and relevant to many stakeholders, it is necessary to 
build close cooperation among institutions and organisations in charge of implementing the actions defined in this Plan and 
evaluating the outcomes. The General Directorate of Renewable Energy of the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources will 
conduct the process of ensuring the said coordination and cooperation, monitoring, reporting and validating the Action Plan.Under the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan that will be implemented in the period of 2017-2023, it is aimed to reduce 
the primary energy consumption of Turkey by 14% by 2023 through 55 actions defined in 6 categories namely buildings 
and services, energy, transport, industry and technology, agriculture and cross-cutting (horizontal) areas. It is also projected 
to achieve savings 23.9 mtoe cumulatively by 2023, for which 10.9 billion USD of investment will be made (Table 1). The 
cumulative savings by 2033 will be 30.2 billion USD at 2017 prices, where the effect of certain savings will continue through 
2040. The average payback period for actions is 7 years.

69281.1 Bases of the Action Plan
The Energy Efficiency Law No. 5627 enforced in 2007 defines its fundamental purpose as to use energy effectively, avoid 
waste, ease the burden of energy costs on the economy, and improve efficiency in using energy resources and energy to 
protect the environment.
The National Climate Change Strategy of 2010-2023 aims to increase energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
in buildings, industry, transport and energy sectors.
The Energy Efficiency Strategy of 2012-2023 defines a set of policies supported by result-oriented goals and devises actions 
that must be taken to achieve the goals.
Further, the Tenth Development Plan of 2014-2018 defines energy efficiency measures that will be taken in the period in line 
with “1.14 Energy Efficiency Improvement Programme.”
In addition, the 2015-2019 Strategic Plan of the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources defines energy efficiency goals 
under “Goal 4: A Turkey that Uses Energy Efficiently” and “Goal 5: Developed Capacity for Energy Efficiency and Saving” under 
“Theme: 2 Energy Efficiency and Energy Savings”. 
The Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and Council of 25 October 2012 on Energy Efficiency requires the 
Member States to draft national energy efficiency action plans that proposes a structural framework and implementation 
methodology on energy efficiency. The introduction of the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan in our country is an important 
step in harmonising with the said Directive.
On the other hand, the goals of the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan interlinked with the legislative texts listed above are 
also included in the National Energy and Mining Policy issued by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources.1.2 Scope of the Action Plan
The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan includes 55 actions in buildings and services, energy, transport, industry and 
technology, agriculture and cross-cutting (horizontal) areas. Covering the technological, economic, social and environmental 
dimensions; considering innovative and best practices; prioritising stakeholder management; and having been prepared 
in line with the principle of effectiveness and efficiency, the Action Plan also includes resource efficiency to promote 
competitiveness. The Plan is developed as flexible, measurable and revisable to adapt changing conditions and open to 
innovations in process and methods. 
The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan aims to boost and accelerate efforts to improve energy efficiency in all sectors 
to make energy efficiency support models more effective; develop sustainable finance mechanisms; advance sustainable 
procurement; develop culture, awareness and consciousness of energy efficiency in public and private sectors; promote onsite generation and consumption; position smart cities and smart networks in respect of energy efficiency; improve energy 
efficiency in industry, transport and agriculture; scale up district heating systems; increase the use of alternative fuels and 
resources in the context of energy efficiency; promote environment-friendly structures, and make existing structures more 
efficient.
1.3 Process of Drafting the Action Plan
The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan was prepared with active participation and contribution from the public institutions 
and organisations involved in energy efficiency policies and implementations, non-governmental organisations and sectoral 
stakeholders. General and sectoral workshops were in Ankara, Bursa, Gaziantep, Izmir and Istanbul to solicit the opinions of 
relevant institutions and organisations.
By the decision of the Energy Efficiency Coordination Board, the agenda of the 2016 meeting of the Advisory Board was set 
as the “National Energy Efficiency Action Plan.” Accordingly, the Advisory Board convened on 28-29 November 2016 with 268 
participants from 160 institutions for analysing the actions in the draft plan, prioritising the actions and setting the framework. 
The actions were finalised with inputs from the responsible institutions and organisations.BASELINE 2 REVIEW

Turkey’s gross domestic product (GDP) steadily increased in the period of 2005-2015 except for 2009 and 2010. The cumulative 
growth in the period is by 65%, corresponding to an annual GDP growth 5.2%. The primary energy consumption in the same 
period grew by 46%, i.e. lower than GDP growth. This means that less energy is consumed to produce a unit of added value (see 
Figure 1).

Source: GDRE, 2017.The energy intensity index is an important indicator of the contribution to the national economy through the energy savings 
and energy efficiency improvement in primary and end-use energy consumption in manufacturing, housing and transport 
sectors. The breakdown of the indicator shows that, for the period of 2000-2015, the manufacturing sector achieved an annual 
improvement rate of 1.8%, housing sector 1.9% and transport sector 2.7% for an overall annual improvement of 2.1% in energy 
efficiency (see Figure 4).

Source: GDRE, 2017.The fact that our energy intensity is high while our energy consumption per capita is lower than developed countries shows 
that Turkey has a significant potential for energy savings (see Figure 6). In the period of 2005-2014, when Turkey’s GDP 
increased by 1 unit, the energy consumption increased only by 0.7 unit. In the same period, against the 1 unit of increase in 
GDP, France reduced its energy consumption by 1.1 unit, Germany 0.7 unit, Japan 3.3 units and the United Kingdom 2.0 units.
The primary energy intensity in 2015 in Turkey is 0.12 toe per 1,000 USD at 2010 prices, estimated on the basis of 2009-based 
new GDP series published by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TURKSTAT) on 12 December 2016. While this figure is lower than 
the world average of 0.18 toe, it is higher than the OECD average of 0.11 toe. The figure is 0.08 in Germany, 0.07 in Italy and 
EU-28 average is 0.09 toe.

The buildings sector in Turkey has grown strongly in recent years, with 19.5 mtoe of end-use energy 
consumption in 2000 going up to 32.4 mtoe in 2015 by an increase of 66%. The average annual 
increase in demand for energy has been 4.4% in the buildings sector, and its share in end-use energy 
consumption reached 32.8%, exceeding that of the industry (see Figure 7).

The TURKSTAT data indicate that as of 2017, there are 9.1 million buildings in Turkey, approximately 87% of which 
are residential. The number of housing units is above 22 million1. According to the occupancy permit statistics, 
more than 100,000 new buildings are added every year to the building stock. Those statistics suggest that Turkey 
has a rapidly growing and transforming building stock. In this context, it is possible to save energy significantly 
through making the new buildings more energy-efficient as well as improving the existing buildings. In addition, 
the buildings and services sector has significant potential for using renewable energy resources and on-site 
generation. 
buildings
fficientGoals were set for increasing energy efficiency and reducing building-based energy consumption in Turkey, and 
actions are underway to achieve the goals. Under the Climate Change Action Plan 2011-2023, various objectives 
were defined to increase energy efficiency and the share of renewable energy in electricity consumption.
The Energy Efficiency Strategy defines actions to “introduce maximum energy requirements for buildings and 
limits for maximum emissions” and “impose administrative sanctions on those which emit carbon dioxide at 
quantities above the legally defined limits” under the strategic goal “reduce building energy demand and carbon 
emissions; scale up sustainable, environment-friendly buildings that use renewable energy resources.” The 
paper also defines actions to “require sustainability in building licensing” and “scale up on-site generation for 
mass housing” under the strategic goal “transform at least one fourth of the building stock in 2010 to sustainable 
buildings by 2023.”
The Tenth Development Plan defines a component “Improving Energy Efficiency in Buildings” under the Energy 
Efficiency Improvement Programme Action Plan; which component requires actions to develop financing 
mechanisms and improve the legislative framework in order to improve energy efficiency in buildings.
To achieve the defined goals, both the public and private sectors undertake efforts to improve energy efficiency 
in buildings. The Regulation on Energy Performance for Buildings requires that new buildings have at least C 
class Energy Performance Certificates. While the existing buildings must have energy performance certificates, 
the requirement for energy performance certificates in transactions of sales and lease of buildings was deferred 
to 2020. Work is underway to commission energy efficiency audits and realise the identified potential in the 
framework of the Regulation on Improving Efficiency in Energy Resources and Energy Use.
Under this Action Plan, 12 actions are defined to improve energy efficiency in the buildings and services sector in 
line with the strategic goals described above. The said actions involve such activities as improving the efficiency 
classes of new and existing buildings, realising the savings potential in the public sector, scaling up on-site 
generation and use of renewable energy in buildings, drawing up a comprehensive inventory of buildings, and 
engaging in awareness efforts directed to all stakeholding segments. The actions under the Plan are in line with 
all strategy papers adopted earlier, and include the details of implementation to achieve the goals defined in the 
said papers.

fficient2.2.2 Industry and Technology
The industry with a share of 26% in GDP 2015 has continued in recent years to grow and drive the economic 
growth in our country as in many other countries. With the industry accounting for 32.4% of the end-use energy 
consumption and 47.6% of the net electricity in 2015, the Turkish economy is more “energy-intensive” compared 
to developed countries. Energy efficiency has become a priority area due to the fact that energy costs constitute 
one of the heaviest burdens on enterprises. Improvement in energy efficiency in industry offers significant 
opportunities to reduce energy consumption as well as improve process efficiency, upgrade technological 
development levels, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The Energy Efficiency Law introduced requirements for industrial enterprises of a certain size to commission 
energy efficiency audits and establish energy management structures. In addition, various support mechanisms 
were introduced such as Efficiency Improvement Projects (EIPs) and Voluntary Agreements. Investments for 
energy efficiency projects designed to save energy by at least 20% on the baseline, with a simple payback period 
of 5 years or shorter in manufacturing industry plants with minimum 500 toe of annual energy consumption are 
allowed to benefit incentives accorded to investments made in the fifth region. 
The Energy Efficiency Strategy aims to reduce energy densities at rates not to be less than 10% to be set by 
sectoral cooperation in each subsector of the industry. To achieve such objective, various actions are defined such 
as promoting investments to improve energy efficiency and identifying savings potentials and measures that can 
be taken for energy efficiency in industrial subsectors. 
The Tenth Development Plan defines actions to “replace low efficiency AC electrical motors with higher efficiency 
ones,” “improve mechanisms to support training, audit and consulting services in energy efficiency for SMEs” 
and “scale up technologies and good practices of energy efficiency in SMEs” under the “Energy Efficiency 
Improvement Programme.”
Under this Action Plan, 7 actions are defined to improve energy efficiency in the industry and technology sector 
in line with the strategic goals described above. The said actions involve such activities as engaging in support 
activities, mapping the energy saving potential in industry, increasing the diversity of projects, defining new 
support mechanisms, scaling up cogeneration systems in large heat-using facilities, implementing environmentfriendly design and labelling system for appliances.

fficient2.2.3 Energy
In parallel with the rising living standards and growing population, the electricity demand in Turkey has significantly 
increased in recent years. The gross electricity consumption which increased by 3.3% on the previous year in 2016 
to reach 278.8 billion kWh is expected to reach 367.9 billion kWh in 2023 in the low-demand scenario, or 407.9 billion 
kWh in the high-demand scenario.2
A review of per capita electricity consumption as a significant energy indicator reveals that the figure for Turkey is 
3,224 kWh (gross), USA 12,902 kWh, France 7,124 kWh, Germany 6,779 kWh, United Kingdom 5,217 kWh and OECD 
average 8,106 kWh.3 The data suggest that Turkey has lower per capita electricity consumption than developed 
economies; and with rising prosperity levels, the per capita electricity consumption will increase in our country.
Through the policies and strategy papers implemented to date, various goals have been identified to improve 
efficiency in the energy sector in Turkey, and various works undertaken to achieve the goals. In this context, the 
Climate Change Action Plan defines goals to reduce total loss in transmission and distribution grids to 8% in 
our country which is above the OECD average, improve energy efficiency in all sectors and increase the share of 
renewable energy in electricity generation. The Energy Efficiency Strategy sets the strategic goals for the sector 
under the title “improve efficiency in electricity generation, transmission and distribution; reduce energy losses and 
emissions harmful to environment.” The Tenth Development Plan defines actions to develop projects to use the 
waste heat from the existing coal-fired thermal power plants in district heating and agricultural activities in order 
to scale up on-site generation, cogeneration and micro cogeneration in electricity generation; scale up electricity 
generation from waste heat in industry; build a market for trade of waste heat energy; and take incentivising 
measures to promote cogeneration and micro cogeneration installations.
Under the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan, 10 actions are defined to improve the sustainability of the energy 
sector and accelerate the transformation into an energy-efficient sector in line with the strategic goals set in 
various policy papers. The said actions involve identifying cogeneration and district heating&cooling systems and 
preparing a roadmap for legislation, managing peak load arising from heating&cooling, implementing efficiency 
standards for natural gas infrastructure, scaling up smart meters, presenting the customers with comparable 
and detailed bills; creating an energy data platform for smart management of measurement data, implementing 
minimum performance standards for transformers, improving energy efficiency in public lighting, improving energy 
efficiency in electricity transmission and distribution, improving efficiency in existing power plants, building market 
infrastructure for demand-side response.

fficient2.2.4 Transport
A rapid integration process, novelties in technology, population getting denser in cities and economic development 
in the world lead to an increase in the demand for quality, safe and comfortable transport services which in turn 
makes the transport a rapidly growing, dynamic sector. The growth in the transport sector moves along the axis of 
road transport depending particularly on petroleum, entailing such issues as energy supply security; environmental, 
air and noise pollution in environment; degradation of natural areas and health problems. This necessitates that 
energy be used effectively and efficiently in the transport sector. 
The 2015 data suggest that the transport sector accounts for approximately 25% of the total end-use energy 
consumption in Turkey; where road transport accounts for 91.6% of the consumption in the transport sector. And 
the energy consumption in the road transport is almost totally based on petroleum products. In our country where 
a large part of the need for petroleum is met by imports, it is possible by certain measures to improve energy 
efficiency in the transport sector, and thereby reduce external dependency for petroleum.
In order to ensure a balanced distribution among modes in the transport sector, it is important to develop combined/
intermodal/multimodal applications in passenger and freight transport, increase the share of railroad and maritime 
transport, and adopt the corridor approach in transport planning. In this line, the Transport and Communications 
Strategy Goal 2023 defines objectives to increase the share of railroad transport in freight transport beyond 15%, 
and in passenger transport beyond 10%. It is planned thereby to reduce the road transport’s share in freight under 
60% and passenger under 72% by the end of 2023.
transportation
fficientAs of 2016, Turkey had approximately 21 million motor vehicles, with an average age of 12.9 years.4 The high average 
age is disadvantageous both in respect of fuel economy and environment. Therefore, our country occasionally 
introduces certain regulations and incentives to set aside old vehicles as scrap. The last of such regulations was 
issued by the General Communiqué No. 48 on Motor Vehicle Tax, introducing incentives to set aside as scrap the 
motor vehicles of make year 1997 or older as registered in the motor vehicle registries.
To build a sustainable transport system in our country, it is crucial to integratively plan and operate the transport 
infrastructure, integrate transport modes, reduce unit fuel consumption of vehicles, and develop policies 
and strategies that minimises damage to the environment. In this context, the Energy Efficiency Strategy, a 
major document which addresses energy efficiency in transport in our country, aims to reduce unit fossil fuel 
consumption of motor vehicles, increase the share of railroads in passenger and freight transport and of urban 
public transport, prevent unnecessary fuel consumption in urban transport, and reduce emissions harmful to the 
environment.
The Climate Change Action Plan 2011-2023 aims, among other things, to use transport modes in a balanced way 
for passenger and freight transport, restructure urban transport in line with sustainable transport principles, 
scale up the use of alternative fuels and clean car technologies, and improve energy efficiency in the sector. 
In addition, there are measures for the transport sector in the National Intelligent Transport Systems Strategy 
(2014-2023) of the Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications which aims to adapt information 
and communication technologies to the transport sector.
transportation
fficientIn addition to the said papers, transport master plans issued by municipalities lay down the goals and objectives 
at local scale and engage in activities to those ends. Further, the policy papers issued by various institutions and 
organisations address energy efficiency in transport.
Under this Action Plan, which holistically treats, analyses and proposes solutions on the issue of energy 
efficiency in the transport sector which obviously occupies a significant place in the policies and strategies 
of our country, 9 actions are defined for the transport sector to ensure sustainability and promote energy 
efficiency. Identified as the priority action areas are promoting energy-efficient vehicles, developing comparative 
studies on alternative fuels and new technologies, developing and improving bicycle and pedestrian transport, 
reducing the use of passenger cars to reduce traffic density in cities, developing and implementing institutional 
restructuring for urban transport, strengthening maritime transport, strengthening rail transport and collecting 
data on transport.

fficient2.2.5 Agriculture
To build a competitive agriculture sector in our country, it is necessary and in priority to effectively use the 
physical potential, energy and resources; regulate and aggregate lands; scale up energy efficiency activities to 
increase the mechanisation level in agriculture and use renewable energy resources in agriculture.
The Agriculture Law includes as the goals of agricultural policies to develop agricultural production in accordance 
with the domestic and foreign demand, protect and develop natural and biological resources, improve productivity, 
strengthen food security and safety, develop producers’ organisations, strengthen agricultural markets, increase 
the prosperity level in the agriculture sector through rural development.
The Tenth Development Plan addresses the effective use of food, water and natural resources and transformation 
in global energy system as priority matters under the title of global developments and trends. It is aimed to 
create an agriculture sector that is based on sufficient and balanced nutrition for the society, relies on advanced 
technologies, has solved infrastructure problems, is highly productive, has effective production structure based 
on demand, has increased international competitiveness, and uses natural resources sustainably. Additional 
objectives include supporting such environment-friendly practices as renewable energy, eco-efficiency and clean 
production technologies in agricultural production and services, promoting the development and branding of new 
environment-friendly products.
The Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock, Agriculture and Rural Development Support Institute, General 
Directorate of Agricultural Enterprises, General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works execute support policies 
focusing on good agricultural practices in terms of the current support systems in the agriculture sector. The 
said support programmes for agricultural production under various support mechanisms contribute indirectly to 
improving energy efficiency.
Under this Action Plan, 6 actions are defined to improve energy efficiency in the agriculture sector, involving 
promoting the replacement of tractors and harvesters with new, energy-efficient ones, switching to energyefficient irrigation methods, supporting energy efficiency projects in the agriculture sector, encouraging the use 
of renewable energy resources in agricultural production, identifying agricultural by-products and waste potential 
to produce biomass and promoting its use, supporting energy efficiency in the fisheries sector.

COORDINATION AND 4 MONITORING• Energy efficiency actions involve multiple disciplines; and institutions and organisations designated as responsible institutions 
are responsible for implementing and scaling up the actions. The designated responsible institutions under the Action Plan 
will pay special attention to the actions under the Action Plan when preparing their institutional budgets and annual work 
programmes. Those designated as relevant institutions will cooperate with the responsible institutions and support the 
actions. All public organisations and relevant stakeholders included in the Action Plan will be responsible for nationwide 
implementation of the Action Plan. The designated responsible institutions will coordinate the activities by the relevant 
institutions for actions.
• The General Directorate of Renewable Energy of the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources is the responsible institution 
for monitoring and coordinating the Action Plan.
• Outputs and performance indicators for actions have been identified, which will allow the further definition of detailed 
performance indicators. Activities for monitoring and evaluating the actions will proceed on semi-annual basis. For effective 
monitoring and evaluation, the progress will be reported, potential deviations be identified and measures be taken timely.
In order to improve energy efficiency across the country; the effective implementation of policies and measures, monitoring 
and evaluation of results are as important as the identification of correct and consistent policies and measures. The actions 
under the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan will be implemented, coordinated and monitored as follows:• The Energy Efficiency Coordination Board which is mandated, authorised and charged with preparing national energy efficiency 
strategies, plans and programmes, assessing the impact and revising as necessary thereof, and coordinating the introduction 
and implementation of new measures will also serve as the Monitoring, Evaluation and Steering Board for the National Energy 
Efficiency Action Plan. The board may also make general assessments of the actualisation levels of the actions under the 
Action Plan as well as the achievement levels of the targets defined in the Action plan. The Board is authorised to update the 
actions under the Action Plan, and re-designate responsible and relevant institutions and amend timelines.
• Six Monitoring and Evaluation Commissions will be established on the basis of categories under the Action plan, namely crosscutting (horizontal) areas, buildings and services, industry and technology, transport, energy and agriculture. Coordinated by 
the General Directorate of Renewable Energy, the Monitoring and Evaluation Commission will have at least one expert from 
institutions designated as responsible and relevant under the respective actions. Starting from May 2018, the Commissions 
will convene in May and November of every year, assess the actualisation levels of actions, and identify additional measures 
needed. The progress reports will be prepared and submitted to the Energy Efficiency Coordination Board. The Board may 
request detailed presentation, additional explanation on actions from the responsible institutions. 
• The General Directorate of Renewable Energy will undertake necessary activities and provide bases for the monitorability of 
actions, and for commissions to effectively function.
• Relevant institutions will be responsible, within their remits, for providing all possible support to the responsible institutions, 
participating in the meetings during the implementation and engaging in necessary correspondence.
• The information on the actualisation levels of the actions under the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan will be prepared in 
a common reporting format. The said information will also be entered and monitored in the ENVER Portal. 
• A summary progress report of the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan will be disclosed in April every year to the public 
following the approval by the Energy Efficiency Coordination Board.
