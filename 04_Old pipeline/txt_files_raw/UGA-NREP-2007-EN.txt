i) Introduction 
The Energy Policy for Uganda which was approved by Cabinet and published in 
September 2002 laid down Government’s commitment to the development and 
utilization of renewable energy resources and technologies. This Renewable Energy 
Policy document, which was approved by Cabinet on the 29th March 2007, therefore 
reinforces that commitment. 
 
The implementation of the policy objectives will positively respond to the various 
policy instruments and programmes, which address poverty, catalyze 
industrialization and protect the environment. These include; the Uganda 
Constitution 1995, the Poverty Eradication and Action Plan, the Millennium 
Development Goals, the Electricity Act 1999, the National Environment Act 1995, the 
Programme for the Modernization of Agriculture and the Kyoto Protocol. 
 
The following stakeholders should take particular interest in the provisions of this 
Policy: Project Sponsors; Consultants; Contractors; Manufacturers; Equipment 
Dealers; Training and Research Institutions; Media Houses; Central Government 
Ministries; Local Governments; Parastatals; Civil Society Organisations; Financial 
Institutions and Development Partners. 
The overall objective of the Renewable Energy Policy is to diversify the energy 
supply sources and technologies in the country. In particular, the policy goal is to 
increase the use of modern renewable energy from the current 4% to 61% of the 
total energy consumption by the year 2017. In this respect, the following key areas 
have therefore been addressed. 
 
ii) Small Renewable Energy Power Investment 
The current situation is that feed in tariffs and power purchase agreements are 
negotiated, on a case by case basis. This increases transaction time, costs and 
leads to low investor turn out. Furthermore, the current feed – in - tariffs are low, 
because project sponsors expected some subsidy. With the removal of subsidies, 
the tariffs will be higher. By publishing the feed in tariffs and having a standardized 
power purchase agreement, the business environment is made more predictable 
and thus transaction costs will be reduced and investments should increase. This 
measure will apply to hydro power schemes, cogeneration plants and is already 
being implemented. This will increase the accessibility of electrical power to middle 
income households and spur economic development. iii) Solar Energy Technologies 
Solar energy technologies have high upfront costs and there is no regulation that 
obligates urban developers to invest in solar energy technologies. By implementing 
this policy, both medium income households and owners of residential and 
commercial buildings in urban areas, will be encouraged to invest in solar 
technologies. This measure will require legislation for urban and local authorities to 
implement. 
iv) Biofuels 
This policy lays out specific modalities for the development and production of bio 
fuels. The industry has had no facility to test and monitor standards. Furthermore, 
petroleum companies were not obligated to blend bio fuels. By providing fiscal 
incentives to bio fuels producers and establishing a testing facility at the Uganda 
National Bureau of Standards (UNBS), bio fuels production is expected to increase 
significantly. This will be further accelerated by legislation, which will obligate 
petroleum companies to blend fossil fuels with at least up to 20% bio fuels. These 
bio fuels will be used mainly, in the transport sector and for power generation. 
v) Biomass Energy Development and Utilization 
 Previously, there were no specific incentives for the growing of energy crops. There 
is still limited use of efficient wood fuel, charcoal stoves and biogas in households, 
institutions and industries. Charcoal production and transportation is not properly 
regulated and the disposal of biomass waste by burning, without extracting the 
energy content, is a common practice countrywide. The provision of incentives for 
the growing of energy crops will contribute to reafforestation and sustainable use of 
biomass. 
 The reduced consumption of both wood and charcoal through the use of the energy 
efficient stoves and especially for the low income, households will greatly reduce on 
endemic health diseases caused by indoor pollution. More importantly, it will further 
reduce the rate of deforestation. 
 This Policy provides for the increased use of biogas, which will improve both energy 
supply and sanitation, in low and middle income rural households. In addition the 
Policy provides for the enactment of the legislation to control open burning or 
disposal of biomass wastes, without extracting the energy content of the biomass. 
This measure will increase the energy available for use and reduce further 
deforestation. 
 
 vi) Sustainability 
 In order to sustain the development of renewable energy and technologies in 
general, Government will:- • continue with the acquisition and dissemination of technical data and avail the 
data and general information to the public in order to create awareness on 
consumption options and investment opportunities; 
• create a Renewable Energy Department and an Energy Efficiency and 
Conservation Department in the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development; 
• establish a National Energy Committee at the National Level and District Energy 
Committees and District Energy Offices at the Local Governments; 
• promote research and development and strengthen local manufacturing capacity 
in renewable energy technologies; 
• strengthen the newly adopted financing mechanism like the Credit Support 
Facility and Smart Subsidies which are intended to scale up investments in 
renewable energy and rural electrification; and 
• in principle, put in place appropriate legislation to operationalise some of the new 
policy measures which interalia include (a) the feed in tariffs, (b) biofuels 
production and blending, (c) adoption of alternative technologies (e.g. solar water 
heating), (d) regulation of charcoal production and transportation, (e) fiscal and 
financial incentives for renewable energy investment, (f) the institutional 
framework and (g) environment protection.
vii) Consultations 
Various studies have been undertaken and consultations held with a wide range of 
stakeholders to develop the Renewable Energy Policy for Uganda. These included 
the private sector, consultants, project developers and Non Governmental 
Organizations both locally and internationally. A Technical Team, to move the policy 
formulation process was appointed and had the opportunity to review renewable 
energy policies of USA, European Union, Brazil, India, South Africa, Kenya, 
Tanzania, Nigeria, Swaziland among others. The knowledge gained has now been 
incorporated into this Policy Document. 
The following Ministries and Institutions were consulted and they actively 
participated in the policy formulation; the Ministry of Water and Environment, the 
Ministry of Local Government, the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs, the 
Ministry of Lands and Urban Development, the Ministry of Finance, Planning and 
Economic Development, the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries, 
thNtil Eit Mt AthitthNtil FtAthitand the Uganda National Bureau of Standards, the Electricity Regulatory Authority, 
the Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited, among others. 
viii) Conclusion 
In conclusion, I wish to pay special tribute for the guidance I received from His 
Excellency President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, President of the Republic of Uganda 
and Colleagues in Cabinet during the policy formulation process; and my Colleagues 
in the Ministry, Hon. Simon D’Ujanga, Minister of State for Energy and Hon. Dr. 
Kamanda Bataringaya, Minister of State for Mineral Development, for offering the 
necessary advice. I wish specifically to thank the Technical Team, which 
spearheaded the overall policy formulation and compilation process and was headed 
by the Permanent Secretary, Mr. F.A. Kabagambe–Kaliisa, with the following key 
officials: the Coordination Manager, Energy for Rural Transformation Programme, 
Eng. Dr. Albert Rugumayo; the Executive Director, Rural Electrification Agency, Mr. 
Godfrey Turyahikayo; the Commissioner of Energy Resources Department, Eng.

I am equally grateful to the World Bank who in partnership with the Government of 
Uganda facilitated the development of this Policy through the Energy for Rural 
Transformation Programme. 
 THE RENEWABLE ENERGY POLICY 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 Renewable Energy Policy Context 
1. The National Energy Policy, published in 2002, spelt out Government’s 
commitment to the development and use of renewable energy resources for both 
small and large scale applications. Therefore, this Renewable Energy Policy is a 
concretization of this commitment, setting out Government’s policy vision, goals, 
principles and objectives for promoting sustainable utilization of renewable 
energy in Uganda. 
2. While Uganda has an endowment of a variety of renewable energy resources, 
only large hydro resources along the Nile have been developed to some extent to 
provide electricity through a national grid. The other resources that have 
remained largely untapped include small hydro, biomass, solar, wind and 
geothermal sources. 
3. Biomass, which supplies over 90% of the country’s energy requirements, has 
continued to be used in its traditional form, largely as firewood and crop residues. 
Petroleum products, wholly imported, and the limited hydropower plants, provide 
the balance of modern energy requirements. 
The Need for the Renewable Energy Policy 
4. Although the need to develop an elaborate Renewable Energy Policy is rooted in 
the recognition that a number of renewable energy technologies have become 
commercially viable and therefore, need to be brought into the national energy supply mix, it has also been reinforced by four major challenges the Government 
has faced in meeting the energy needs of its people. 
5. The first challenge is the unprecedented electricity supply deficit on the national 
grid due to the fall in Lake Victoria water levels as a result of a prolonged 
drought. This has necessitated the installation of 100 MW of emergency thermal 
diesel generation, to be followed by another 100 MW, to bridge the gap which is 
very expensive. 
6. The second challenge is the escalating oil prices on the international market, 
which impose a heavy burden on the economy and constrains the individual 
consumers’ budgets. 
7. The third challenge is to make electricity accessible to the rural population, 
through grid extension and mini-grids, considering that the level of electrification 
is very low.1
 This calls for alternative approaches to support rural transformation 
and meet the Millennium Development Goals. Small scale renewable energy 
generation using mini / micro / pico hydros, PV systems, wind power and 
biomass can provide the necessary supply. 
8. The fourth challenge is the fulfilment of Government’s commitment on 
greenhouse gas emissions reductions, under the Kyoto Protocol and contribute 
to the global fight against climate change. In particular, Government would want 
to provide the necessary framework for private sector investors in renewable 
energy projects to benefit from the available facilities in emissions trading. 9. The above challenges have prompted Government to consider a faster and more 
comprehensive way of introducing renewable energy sources, as alternatives or 
supplements to the conventional sources. 
The Effect of this Policy 
10. The overall effect of this Renewable Energy Policy will be to diversify the energy 
supply sources and mechanisms. This is of strategic importance because it 
promotes energy security and independence. The other effects are explained 
below. 
 
11. In the first instance, the presence of distributed generation, whether grid 
connected or for independent grids (stand alone) from renewable energy 
sources, other than large hydros, minimizes the risk of overdependence on one 
source, which may suffer natural or other catastrophes as has been seen with 
the effect of drought, on the levels of Lake Victoria. 
12. Secondly, the continually rising cost of oil on the international market has 
contributed greatly to the commercial viability of bio-fuels, like ethanol, methanol, 
biogas and bio-diesel. Whole or partial substitution of petroleum products with 
locally produced bio-fuels, reduces the burden on the economy caused by 
imported fuels and therefore, moves the country towards energy security and 
independence. 
13. Thirdly, the Policy enables renewable energy technologies to be incorporated 
into the national energy conservation programme. For instance, widespread 
installation of compact fluorescent lighting and solar water heating in residential, 
industrial and commercial buildings can create significant energy savings, and 
therefore encouraging optimal utilization of our energy resources.  Renewable Energy Resources 
14. Renewable sources of energy are those sources that are replenished 
continuously by natural processes. This includes solar energy, hydropower, 
biomass, wind and geothermal among others. In this Policy, as done in many 
other national energy policies, peat and wastes are also considered as 
renewable sources of energy. 
15. Modern Renewable Energy means renewable energy resources that are 
transformed into modern energy services like electricity, which can be generated 
from water power, wind power, solar energy, geothermal energy and biomass 
cogeneration. It also refers to clean fuels derived from renewable energy 
resources like biogas, ethanol, methanol, hydrogen or solar water heating as well 
as biomass utilized in efficient biomass technologies, like improved charcoal 
stoves and improved firewood stoves. 
 
16. Uganda is richly endowed with renewable energy resources for energy 
production and the provision of energy services. The total estimated electrical 
power potential is about 5300 MW. These resources however, remain largely 
unexploited, mainly due to the perceived technical and financial risks. 
 Why Renewable Energy? 
17. The ever increasing cost of fossil fuels makes them too expensive for developing 
countries. 
18. Fossil fuels have an uncertain future. Experts show that if the world continues to 
consume energy at the current rate, the non renewable sources will be 
exhausted in the near future. 
– Oil is expected to last for only 40 more years. – Coal may be available for the next 280 years. 
19. Emissions from coal and fossil fuels are responsible for global warming and 
climate change. 
Barriers to Renewable Energy Development 
20. In order for Government to meet its commitment to promote the development and 
utilization of renewable energy, a number of barriers will have to be addressed. 
The key areas to consider are: 
a) Renewable Energy Specific Issues: 
1. Most renewable energy technologies have much higher upfront 
investment costs, compared to other conventional energy options. 
2. Legal and institutional frameworks to support new renewable energy 
investments are still inadequate. 
3. There is limited technical and institutional capacity in the public and 
private sectors, to implement and manage renewable energy investments. 
4. Financing mechanisms to support investments in renewable energy 
projects and to address the affordability of consumers are either 
inappropriate or inadequate. 
5. There is limited awareness of the availability, benefits and opportunities of 
renewable energy within the public domain. 
6. Biomass energy resources are utilized inefficiently and therefore, 
unsustainably. 
7. There are inadequate standards and quality assurance for most RETs. 
8. There is insufficient information and data on renewable energy resources 
availability and technologies. b) Cross-Cutting Issues 
1. Inadequate integrated resource planning. This type of planning integrates 
supply planning considerations with demand side constraints and 
environmental planning considerations. 
2. Inadequate attention to training, research and development, and 
technological transfer in the energy sector. 
3. Inadequate integration of energy issues in the policies and regulatory 
instruments of non-energy sectors. 
4. Many energy activities, which include production, transportation and 
utilization, are carried out without paying sufficient attention to their 
implications on environmental sustainability. 
5. Inadequate utilization of the instruments of regional and international 
cooperation, to support investments in renewable energy. 
6. Insufficient stakeholder participation in the planning and implementation of 
energy projects. 
Policy Vision, Goal, Principles and Objectives 
21. Government’s Policy Vision for Renewable Energy is: 
To make modern renewable energy a substantial part of the national energy 
consumption.
22. The Overall Policy Goal is: 
To increase the use of modern renewable energy, from the current 4% to 61% of

i. Energy is essential for poverty eradication, regional equity and socioeconomic development. 
ii. Reliability, efficiency and sustainability are essential in the successful 
deployment of renewable energy technologies. iv. Public-private partnerships will form the basic mechanism for renewable 
energy investments. 
v. Energy pricing will be based on full economic, social and environmental 
costs, taking into account the affordability and social good. 
vi. The avoided cost principle will be used for determining feed in tariffs. 
vii. The gender dimension will be integrated in renewable energy planning and 
management. 
viii. It is necessary to enhance stakeholder participation, including Government, 
the private sector and communities. 
ix. It is necessary to enhance market competitiveness of renewable energy 
technologies.

Policy Actions 
26. The strategies to achieve the policy objectives have been translated into policy 
actions in the form of specific programmes as indicated below:-
(i) Power Generation Programme 
This programme will support public and private sector investments in 
renewable energy generation and consists of two approaches; one for large 
hydropower schemes and one for small power schemes. 
a) Large Hydropower Schemes 
Sites will be tendered out according to the provisions of the Electricity Act, 
1999 Sections 29 and 32. The developer will also arrange an appropriate 
financing package. Tariffs will be determined through negotiations, on a 
case by case basis. 
b) Small Power Schemes
Basic studies of the various resources and sites will be carried out 
followed by promotion and tendering to the private sector, followed by their 
development. This will cover mini hydropower schemes, biomass 
cogeneration, wind power, peat, geothermal and solar thermal electric and 
limited to 20 MW installed capacity per plant. The feed-in- tariffs, for 
renewable electricity are presented in Annex 2. These will be reviewed 
periodically. 
(ii) Rural and Urban-poor Electricity Access Programme Electricity access to rural populations and the urban poor require special 
packages to make connections and services affordable. The programme will 
enhance the on-going procedures for community schemes, where the cost of 
connection to the community is subsidized. It will also support the 
development of independent grids supplied by micro and pico hydros and 
biomass gasifiers to be managed by communities and solar PV systems in 
dispersed remote settlements. The programme will prioritize supporting 
electrification for productive uses and key social services. 
(iii) Modern Energy Services Programme 
This programme will support renewable energy technologies such as 
improved wood fuel and charcoal, stoves, solar PV and solar water heaters. 
It will also incorporate the dissemination of biogas, liquefied petroleum gas 
(LPG) and kerosene for cooking as substitutes for wood energy. 
(iv) Biofuels Programme 
This programme will support investments in the production and use of 
ethanol, biodiesel, methanol and biogas. Specifically, all dealers in petroleum 
products will be obligated to blend fossil fuels with biofuels up to 20%, as 
appropriate. 
(v) Energy Efficiency Programme
 The programme seeks to implement the Energy Efficiency Strategy. The 
Government will promote efficient utilization of renewable energy resources, 
through the activities described in the Energy Efficiency Strategy for Uganda.

1.1 The Need for a Renewable Energy Policy 
This Policy on Renewable Energy reinforces the Government’s overall policy on energy 
set out in the Energy Policy for Uganda 2002, whereby Government has spelt out a 
commitment to the development and use of renewable energy resources for both small 
and large scale applications. 
This Policy is based on the need to address the challenges observed, while 
implementing the Energy Policy in general and the Power Sector Reform in particular; 
as well as those threats posed by the increasing energy prices, environmental 
degradation, climate change, as well as Government’s commitment to poverty and 
gender responsive energy actions. Furthermore, implementation of the Renewable 
Energy Policy will result in the disposition of Uganda’s commitments at the Bonn 
Conference on Renewable Energy in 2004. 
This Policy sets out Government’s vision, strategic goals, principles, objectives and 
targets for promoting and implementing renewable energy investments in Uganda. The 
Policy Framework provides a basis for the formulation of planning, implementation and 
monitoring of renewable energy programmes, as well as projects that respond to the 
needs and priorities of the population at various levels of the economy. 
1.2 The Overall Context 
The Government of Uganda has taken a conscious effort to develop renewable energy 
resources as an integral part of the country’s energy future. The promotion of renewable 
energy is specifically included in the Government’s Rural Electrification Strategy and 
Plan (RESP) (2001 – 2010) as one of the most important objectives of the strategy. The 
most vivid step forward has been the inclusion of the development of renewable energy 
(excluding large hydropower) to increase power generation as a key indicator of 
achieving rural transformation in the 10-year Energy for Rural Transformation (ERT) 
Programme. Considering that electrification access in Uganda is still very low, standing at 
approximately 9% nationally and 3% in rural areas, electrification of most parts of the 
country through grid extension in the near future is still a far cry. It is, therefore, within 
this context that Government is promoting the decentralized (distributed), off-grid 
electricity supply model for remote areas. In most of these cases the required electricity 
needs will be met by the deployment of locally available renewable energy sources of 
small hydro, solar energy, wind and biomass resources. The focus on decentralized 
supply systems is also more likely to achieve the objective of equitable regional 
distribution access to electricity, than if only the grid solution was pursued. 
Currently, Uganda is experiencing an unprecedented electricity deficit of about 165 MW, 
resulting into massive load shedding every night, due to the prolonged drought, 
inadequate investment in least cost generation capacity and a relatively high load 
growth. This has forced the country to resort to the installation of very expensive 
thermal generation, while awaiting the construction and commissioning of the 250 MW 
Bujagali and 150 -200 MW Karuma projects. As one of the strategies to bridge the 
deficit and also for long term diversification of generation sources, Government has 
decided to accelerate the development of grid connected small renewable energy 
generation projects to reinforce the grid. This effort is being supported by the 
establishment of a Standardized Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) and a Feed-in 
Tariff, which are part of this Renewable Energy Policy framework, to help expedite 
transactions. 
Apart from promoting accelerated power generation from renewable energy, the Energy 
Policy for Uganda (2002) has, among its objectives, emphasized the development, 
adoption and utilization of other modern fuels and technologies, including those based 
on renewable energy sources, in order to achieve the objectives of emission reduction, 
protection of the environment and energy conservation. Furthermore, the escalating 
prices of fossil fuels on the world market make it imperative for Government to promote 
the development and utilization of renewable energy resources and the associated 
technologies. These include biomass fuels like ethanol, biodiesel, biogas and 
methanol; modern biomass technologies like efficient stoves and kilns and solar water 
heating. The Renewable Energy Policy, is therefore, an elaboration of how Government will develop the necessary initiatives to create a demand for a wide range of renewable 
energy services. 
The commitment of Government to develop the use of renewable energy sources is 
clearly aimed at creating the means of socio-economic development, especially by 
transforming the rural areas. The implementation of the policy’s objectives will, therefore 
positively respond to the various legal and policy instruments and programmes, which 
Government has put in place to address poverty issues, catalyze industrialization and 
protect the environment. Apart from the Energy Policy for Uganda, these instruments 
and programmes include the following: 
• The Uganda Constitution 1995. The provisions on equitable development 
(Article IX), the stimulation of agricultural and industrial growth (Article XI) and 
promotion of energy policies for meeting people’s energy needs in an 
environmentally friendly manner (Article XI) provides the necessary mandate. 
• Meeting the objectives of the Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP) and, on 
a larger scale, achieving the Millennium Development Goals. 
• The Electricity Act 1999, which set the legal framework for reforms in the Power 
Sub-sector and the Rural Electrification Strategy and Plan, the regulatory 
framework for power generation from small renewable energy sources and the 
establishment of the Rural Electrification Fund. 
• The National Environment Statute (1995), which obligates all energy projects 
to undergo an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) as a condition for 
licensing or implementation. 
• The Plan for Modernization of Agriculture (PMA), which has one of its main 
outcomes as “increased access to and use of electricity” to support on-and offfarm economic activities. 
• The Prosperity for All (Bonna Baggaggawale) Government Policy (2006), 
which addresses elevating standards of living through developing the economy in 
areas of micro-finance, marketing, production and processing. In order to 
achieve this, there is need to also address the energy issue, which is one of the • Uganda’s ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, which provides incentives for 
investors in renewable energy technologies for the abatement of carbon 
missions. 
1.3 Electrical Energy Demand
In Uganda, like in any other country, the Energy Sector plays a central role in the 
economy. Energy is the engine for economic growth and development, and a vital input 
into all the productive and social sectors of the economy. Recent forecasts as contained 
in the East African Power Master Plan, have been updated by UETCL to reflect the 
actual MW and GWh in generation and have estimated the yearly growth in demand for 
electricity to be at 7-9 percent as shown in Table 1.1, which confirms that increased 
investments in renewable energy projects are required to respond to the growth in 
demand.

 1.4 The Consultative Process 
The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development has been engaged for a number of 
years in the process of developing the Renewable Energy Policy. Various studies have 
been undertaken and discussions, meetings and workshops have been held with a wide 
range of stakeholders. The stakeholders included: the Private Sector, NGOs, CBOs, 
Service Providers, Consultants, Contractors, Developers, and Investors in cogeneration, 
small scale power producers and promoters of biofuels and our Development Partners. 
The key Government Institutions involved were the Ministry of Finance, Planning and 
Economic Development, the Ministry of Water, Lands and Environment, the Ministry of 
Lands, Housing and Urban Development, the Ministry of Trade, Tourism and Industry, 
the Electricity Regulatory Authority, the Uganda Investment Authority, the Meteorology 
Department, the National Forestry Authority, the National Environment Management 
Authority, the Uganda Electricity Transmission Company, the Rural Electrification 
Agency who constituted the Task Force to finalize this Policy Document. 2. RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES AND 
APPLICATIONS 
2.1 What is Renewable Energy? 
Renewable sources of energy are those sources that are replenished continuously by 
natural processes. This includes solar energy, hydropower, biomass, wind and 
geothermal as well as organic wastes. 
Non-renewable energy are energy sources that are not renewable and hence get 
depleted with time. These include the conventional fossil fuels such as coal, oil and 
natural gas. 
Modern Renewable Energy means renewable energy resources that are transformed 
into modern energy services like electricity, which can be generated from water power, 
wind power, solar energy, geothermal energy and biomass cogeneration. It also refers 
to clean fuels derived from renewable energy resources like biogas, ethanol, methanol, 
hydrogen, biodiesel or solar water heating. In the context of this Policy, modern biomass 
technology and includes energy efficient technologies, like improved charcoal and 
firewood stoves for both domestic and institutional applications. 
Renewable electricity can be generated from wind power, wave, tidal, solar photo 
voltaic (PV), concentrated solar, hydropower, geothermal and biomass (firewood or 
agricultural residues). Renewable energy sources produce no carbon dioxide at all or, 
in the case of biomass, produce only the carbon dioxide they have already absorbed 
from the atmosphere when growing, and hence renewable. Solar energy can be used 
directly to heat water, hence, reducing the demand by electrical water heaters. 2.1.1 Why Renewable Energy? 
Throughout the world, concerted efforts are being made to make renewable energy 
replace non-renewable energy sources in the future. The driving forces for investments 
in renewable energy are: 
1. The ever increasing cost of fossil fuels makes them too expensive for developing 
countries 
2. Fossil fuels have an uncertain future. Experts show that if the world continues to 
consume energy at the current rate, the non renewable sources will be 
exhausted in the near future. 
• The oil fields already discovered hold over 1 billion barrels of oil. If no more oil 
were to be found and we carried on using oil at existing rates, then the 
reserves would last for less than 40 years. Although more oil fields are being 
discovered, the future of oil is bleak. 
• The global proven gas reserve was estimated to be 176 trillion cubic meters 
by the end of 2003. The Russian Federation had the largest share of the 
reserve with almost 27%. Global natural gas consumption in 2004 was 2311.3 
Mtoe. At this consumption rate, it is estimated that the reserve will be 
exhausted in less than 70 years. 
• The proven global coal reserve was estimated to be 984,453 million tonnes 
by the end of 2003. The USA had the largest share of the global reserves 
(25.4%) followed by Russia (15.9%), China (11.6%) and India with 8.6%. In 
the year 2004, the World’s coal consumption was 2775.8 Mtoe representing 
0.28% of the estimated reserves. At this rate of consumption, it is estimated 
that the global reserve can last for only the next 250 years. • Emissions from coal and fossil fuels are responsible for global warming and 
climate change. 
2.2 The Renewable Energy Resource Base 
Uganda has considerable renewable energy resources for energy production and the 
provision of energy services, yet they remain unexploited, largely due to the perceived 
technical and financial risks. These resources include: biomass, geothermal, large scale 
hydro, mini/micro/pico hydro, wind and solar energy. However, with the exception of 
biomass, whose contribution is very significant, the remaining renewable sources 
(including large hydros), contribute about 5% of the country’s total energy consumption. 
This limits the scope and productivity of economic activities, that can be undertaken in 
any part of the country. Thus it is imperative that the use of these abundant resources 
should be enhanced. 
Recently completed studies gave the potential as indicated in Table 2.1. However, more 
site specific data is available for the actual development of the resources.

Biomass is any organic matter that is available on a renewable basis mainly through 
photosynthesis. In the energy context, biomass means products consisting of any whole 
or part of a vegetable matter from agriculture or forestry, which can be used as a fuel for 
the purpose of recovering its energy content. Biomass includes firewood, shrubs, 
grasses, forest wastes and agro-industrial residues. Examples are bagasse, husks, 
trash from sugar, oil milling, grain milling, etc. 
In the context of this Policy, biomass will also include organic municipal and industrial 
wastes like paper wastes, old clothes, polythene, spent grains in breweries, animal 
wastes, abattoir wastes and sewage sludge, which can be used as sources of energy. 
Sometimes these are used as energy sources, but often inefficiently. There is a large 
potential for improving usage efficiencies in the agro-industry. Applications could be for 
electricity generation, fuel for vehicles and for furnace oil substitution. Table 2.2 shows 
the estimated power generation potentials from agro-residues and illustrates their 
residues. Crop residues and agro-industrial residues including husks, bagasse and oil 
residues, play a very significant role in Uganda’s energy supply. 
Biomass contributes over 90% of the total energy consumed in the country and provides 
almost all the energy used to meet basic energy needs for cooking and water heating in 
rural areas, most urban households, institutions, and commercial buildings. Biomass is 
the main source of energy for rural industries. Limited availability of electricity and high 
prices of petroleum products, constitute barriers to a reduction in the demand for 
biomass. Trading in biomass especially charcoal contributes to the rural economy, in 
terms of rural incomes, tax revenue and employment. 
Fuel wood requirements have contributed to the degradation of forests as wood 
reserves are depleted at a rapid rate in many regions. Charcoal consumption increases 
at a rate close to the urban growth rate of 6% per annum. 
Most of the traditional biomass energy technologies; which include wood and charcoal 
stoves, ovens and kilns used in Uganda are inefficient. Several initiatives to conserve 
biomass resources undertaken by Government and the private sector, including NGOs, 
have started to have a significant impact and should be further supported. Some pilot electricity from gasification also offer good opportunities. Biomass distribution 
countrywide is as shown in Fig 2.1

Although biomass is traditionally used in its traditional solid mass (charcoal, wood, 
agricultural residues), its energy resource can also be exploited in non traditional firms 
mentioned below using various technologies. 
2.2.1.1 Biogas 
Biogas is 55-70% methane (CH4) with varying amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) as the 
chief constituents. It also has traces of hydrogen sulphide (H2S), ammonia (NH3), oxygen, 
hydrogen (H2) and water vapour (H2O), depending upon feed materials and other 
conditions. The feed materials are usually animal and human waste. 
Biogas is a zero-waste technology. The products of biogas plants, like biogas and 
digested slurry, can be utilized economically for cooking and as manure for agriculture 
and horticulture. Biogas is a non-poisonous and non-toxic gas, which when mixed with 
air, burns with a blue flame and has no soot or any offensive smell. The slurry is rich in 
nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium and humus material. It has good applications in 
agriculture and horticulture. Methane burns very well, therefore biogas can be used as a 
substitute of kerosene, charcoal and firewood. It is one of the renewable sources of 
energy, which are popular in rural areas and can successfully meet the cooking and trees. 
Since 1980 when biogas technology was first introduced, there have been several 
initiatives, which have involved private individuals, NGOs, Government and Development 
Partners. These have included pilot demonstrations and capacity building. It is estimated 
there are about 500 functioning biogas plants in the country at present and over 250,000 
zero grazing farming households. These define the extent of the potential for small 
household biogas digesters in the country. In addition, commercial dairy farmers and 
piggeries could support several thousand larger biogas plants to cater for their own 
thermal and electricity needs. There is need to develop this resource further and explore 
many opportunities, which exist. 
2.2.1.2 Biofuels for Transport 
Biofuels such as Ethanol and biodiesel are derived from agricultural crops, while 
Methanol is derived from condensing smoke during wood distillation process. Ethanol and 
biodiesel can be blended with or directly substitute for gasoline and diesel, respectively. 
The use of biofuels would reduce toxic air emissions, greenhouse gas buildup and 
dependence on imported oil, while supporting agriculture and rural economies. 
In Uganda, ethanol is being produced on a small scale by sugar manufacturers as a by 
product from the molasses and several small cottage industries from cereals and fruits. 
Biodiesels are a product of fatty acids (like vegetable oils or animal fat) and alcohols like 
ethanol. Vegetable oils can be produced locally, from jatropha, hemp, sunflower, soya 
bean, groundnuts, castor plant and palm oil. 
It is estimated that in the year 2010 Uganda will import and consume 360 million litres of 
diesel and 385 million litres of gasoline. If this fuel could be blended with environmentally 
friendly locally produced biofuel, Methyl Alcohol (25% for gasoline and 60% diesel), it 
would require a total of 312 million litres of Methyl Alcohol, a product from timber locally 
grown by the rural population. In terms of impact on environment, if a total of 312 million 
litres of petroleum products are replaced by Methyl Alcohol, this will replace nearly one 
million tons of CO2 emission in the country. 
2.2.1.3 Biomass Cogeneration 
Combined heat and power (CHP) systems also known as cogeneration, generate 
electricity, mechanical energy and thermal energy in a single or integrated system. This used for heating in industry or buildings. Because cogeneration captures the heat that 
would otherwise be rejected in traditional separate generation of electric or mechanical 
energy, the total efficiency of these integrated systems is much greater than for separate 
systems. 
Currently three factories in Uganda, namely; Kakira Sugar Works Ltd, Kinyara Sugar 
Works Ltd and Sugar Corporation of Uganda Ltd, are doing cogeneration with a total 
electricity generation of over 10 MW. Furthermore, all systems requiring both electrical 
and thermal energy like cement and iron production, tea processing among others, have 
the potential of employing modern cogeneration technologies. 
2.2.1.4 Pyrolysis Oil 
This is relatively new technology and can be used by agro-industries to turn their residues 
into valuable liquid fuel. Applications are in boiler and furnace fuel, replacing HFO, but 
also as fuel for thermal power plants. 
This technology enables owners of residues to turn their bulky wastes into a tradable 
energy commodity. It also enables end-users to employ relatively inexpensive combustion 
systems instead of solid fuel boilers or burners. Municipal waste in Uganda is generally composed of wet carbon and nitrogen rich 
materials that include: organic waste from households, agro industrial waste (slaughter 
houses, food industry) and agro waste: manure and straw. There is a vast amount of 
municipal waste (both solid and sewage effluents) that is currently not being utilized for 
energy production. The capital city, Kampala, alone produces an estimated 430,000 tones 
of solid wastes annually. Other municipalities and towns also generate considerable 
amounts of waste, but do not have in place proper waste management plans. Over 70% 
of the municipal solid waste is vegetable matter (mainly food residues). The current 
practice is either to burn these wastes in the open air or dump them in landfills with no 
extraction of their energy contents. This does not only result in a waste of energy, but also 
causes environmental risks, as the burning is not controlled and the landfills are poorly 
managed. 
This combustible waste matter can be used for electricity generation. The noncombustible organic matter can be digested to produce biogas. The large quantity of 
sewage, can also be effectively used to generate biogas. Biogas can be used as 
domestic fuel, fuel for vehicles, and power generation. 
These materials can be converted into biogas for cooking and lighting at the domestic 
level, whereas commercial dairies and piggeries at the industrial level, can generate 
biogas, to be used by gas turbine to generate electricity and heat in cogeneration 
technology. 
The slurry that comes out of the digester is rich in nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium and 
humus and can be used to replace imported fertilizers and increase agricultural 
productivity on farms. 
In addition to municipal wastes, there are vast quantities of industrial wastes like spent 
grains in the breweries and used boxes, which can all be used for power generation 
2.2.2 Peat 
Though not really a renewable energy resource, in this Policy it is considered under 
renewable energy resources, as is done in some countries. It is estimated that the total 
area of peatlands in Uganda is about 4,000 km2
, while the average thickness of peat 
deposits is about 1.5 metres. The total peat volume is estimated to be 6,000 million cubic The estimated theoretical peat volume represents about 250 Mtoe (million tonnes of oil 
equivalent). Taking into consideration, the varying quality of peat and the Wetland Policy 
of Uganda, as well as the possibility of using conventional peat production methods, 
about 10% could probably be used for power production. The available stock of peat 
resources, would therefore, be adequate for the generation capacity of about 800 MW for 
the next 50 years. However, because of the dispersed nature of the available fuel peat 
resources, peat generation units, could be small (typically less than 20 MW) and 
dispersed mainly to Western and South-Western Uganda, where the desired resource 
characteristics are better than in other regions. 
2.2.3 Hydropower 
The large-scale hydropower potential along the River Nile has been estimated at about 
2,000 MW including six potential major hydropower sites: Bujagali 250 MW, Kalagala 450 
MW, Karuma (Kamdini) 150 MW, Ayago North 300 MW, Ayago South 250 MW and 
Murchison Falls 600 MW. Bujagali and Karuma sites have been significantly studied and 
are being developed on a Public Private Partnership (PPP) basis to generate electricity in 
the medium term. 
2.2.3.1 Bujagali 
Following the withdrawal of AES, Industrial Promotion Services (IPS) of Kenya and Sithe 
Global were selected to develop the Bujagali Project. Project agreements were signed in 
December 2005. Due diligence and environmental updates were carried out and the 
construction commenced in June 2007. Completion is expected in early 2010 bringing on 
board an extra 250 MW.

Uganda, which will supplement other sources of energy. Its major advantages are that it 
is environmentally friendly and multidisciplinary in uses, since it can support various 
development activities ranging from production to processing of raw materials, like 
minerals and agricultural produce. 
Geothermal investigations in Uganda have so far identified three potential areas for 
detailed exploration. They are all situated in western Uganda, in the western branch of 
the East African Rift Valley. The three potential areas are Katwe-Kikorongo, Buranga and 
Kibiro. Based on recent assessments, they have all been ranked as potential targets for 
geothermal development. The total geothermal energy potential is estimated at 450 MW. 
Current efforts by Government are focused on developing the above three areas to a prefeasibility stage, which would pave way for availing required data for feasibility study. The 
pre-feasibility study will involve drilling of deep exploration wells, which will provide 
information on reservoir temperature, fluid chemistry and other petrophysical parameters. 
The current study results indicate that the temperature level varies between 150 C° and 
200 C°. 
Further studies are being carried out countrywide to generate further potential geothermal 
sites. These geothermal areas will then be ranked. Fig 2.4 shows the geothermal sites of 
Uganda. Awa

throughout the year. The mean solar radiation is 5.1 kWh/m2
 per day, on a horizontal 
surface. This level of insolation is quite favorable, for the application of a number of solar 
technologies. These include: 
i) solar water heating; and 
ii) solar photovoltaic systems for supply of basic electricity in rural institutions and 
households as well as areas not connected to the grid. 
The total new installed photovoltaic capacity annually is estimated at 200 kWp for 
households, institutions and commercial use. 
Solar thermal has a great potential in the form of solar water heaters in electrified areas. 
Today electricity is most often used for water heating, in spite of the fact that it will in 
many cases be cheaper for the consumer to use solar energy. Furthermore, small solar 
water heaters are relevant for remote areas, where hot water is needed like in rural clinics 
and tourism areas, to provide a cheap, reliable and environmentally friendly, source of 
energy. 
Solar technology can also be used for power generation, however, the prohibitive costs 
make it less favorable than other sources of power generation. Fig 2.5 shows the 
availability of solar energy countrywide. 26°0'0"E 27°0'0"E 28°0'0"E 29°0'0"E 30°0'0"E 31°0'0"E

heights (less than 10 m) generally range from 2 m/s to about 4 m/s. In some areas with 
complex terrain, the wind may speed up due to slopes of hills and escapements and 
tunneling effects. Based on wind data collected by the Meteorology Department, it was 
concluded that the wind energy resource in Uganda, is sufficient for small scale electricity 
generation and for special applications, such as water pumping mainly in the Karamoja 
region. More recently, low speed turbines have been developed and they have proved 
effective for power generation. 
Recent studies also confirm that electricity generation through wind is feasible, especially 
for small industries or in rural areas where targets for a mill range from 2.5 kV to 10 kV.

to be explored for use in Uganda.
Fuel cell technology is a modern renewable technology that is an alternative source of 
generating energy for rural areas. A fuel cell combines hydrogen and oxygen to produce 
electricity, heat and water. As a result, there is almost no pollution from fuel cells. The 
performance is based on a reaction between hydrogen and oxygen through a Proton 
Exchange Membrane (PEM). The reaction produces both electric and thermal energy that 
can be used to power a house or an entire town/village. 
Fuel cells are promising technologies for use as a source of heat and electricity for rural 
communities, buildings and as an electrical power source for electric motors propelling 
vehicles. The biggest disadvantage of fuel cells is their high relative costs and the high 
energy input required for production. However, it is predicted that fuel cells will offer 
significant cost advantages over traditional energy solutions in the not-too-distant future. 
2.3 Barriers to Renewable Energy Development 
The various barriers preventing steady growth for renewable energy resources 
development and utilization in Uganda are as follows: 
i. High Upfront Costs: High upfront costs of investment in Renewable Energy 
Technologies (RETs) result in many of them not being cost-competitive. For 
example, unit costs for investing in the various renewable energy technologies is: 
solar PV US$12,000-15,000 per KW; solar water heating US$810-1,500 per KW; 
small hydros US$2,500-5,000 per KW. 
ii. Inadequate Legal and Institutional Framework: There has for a long time been 
a lack of a standard procedure and legal instruments for new renewable energy 
investments. There are several institutions involved in RET development and the 
procedure is not well defined. 
iii. Limited Technical and Institutional Capacity: There is limited technical and 
institutional capacity in both the public and private sector to implement and 
manage renewable energy investments. For instance, in the rural areas, there are 
few public and private sector personnel involved in the energy business. Lack of 
skills by public and private actors to address the roles, needs and decision making 
differences for women and men, hinders increased participation and benefits, 
which would have resulted from appropriate renewable energy interventions. Banks currently are not providing long term lending required for RETs. Because 
renewable energy technologies still have high upfront costs, consumers find them 
unaffordable. Mechanisms for consumer financing to address this problem are still 
inadequate. 
v. Underdeveloped Market: The market for RETs and after sale delivery services is 
underdeveloped especially in solar technologies. 
vi. Lack of Awareness: There is limited awareness of the importance of renewable 
energy among the stakeholders, and lack of recognition of women as key 
participants in technology use and innovations. 
vii. Unsustainable use of Biomass: Currently there is inefficient use of biomass and 
lack of replenishment. There is indiscriminate cutting of trees and little use of more 
efficient technologies, such as improved cook stoves and gasification. 
viii. Lack of Standards and Quality Assurance: There are lack of adequate 
standards and mechanisms to monitor and ensure quality of RETs. For instance, 
there are different solar technologies on the market and the general public is not 
aware of their effectiveness. 
ix. Lack of Sufficient Data on Resource Base: Although several studies have been 
conducted on the resource base, this information has not been appropriately 
stored for retrieval or processed, especially for wind, solar and geothermal energy. 
x. Lack of Integrated Resource Planning: Integrated resource planning takes into 
account supply and demand side constraints and environmental planning 
considerations. While Uganda’s energy planning system has concentrated mainly 
on the supply side, it has not integrated renewable energy sources such as the biofuels (ethanol, bio-diesel, methane and methanol) as substitutes for fossil fuels and 
small hydropower development as an integral component of hydro power planning. 
xi. Inadequate Attention to Research and Development (R&D): There is lack of 
focus on R&D in the Energy Sector and no apparent budget is provided to 
institutions of higher learning to specifically conduct R&D. No systems have been 
put in place either for international cooperation in R&D to easily accelerate 
technology transfer. 
xii. Limited Stakeholder Involvement: There has been limited stakeholder involving the various bodies in the Power Sector, is even more desirable. STRATEGIES AND TARGETS 
3.1 The Policy Vision 
The Overall Government Policy Vision for the role of Renewable Energy in the national 
energy economy is: To make modern renewable energy a substantial part of the 
national energy consumption. 
3.2 The Policy Goal 
The Overall Renewable Energy Policy Goal is: To increase the use of modern 
renewable energy, from the current 4% to 61% of the total energy consumption by 
the year 2017. 
3.3 The Key Policy Principles 
The Policy principles are the fundamental premises that Government will use to 
apply, develop and test policy and subsequent actions, including decision making, 
legislation and enforcement. The key principles for renewable energy development 
are: 
1. Energy and Development 
 Energy services such as lighting, heating, cooking, motive power, mechanical 
transport and telecommunication are essential for socio-economic development, 
since they yield social benefits, create employment and generate income. These 
issues are at the core of poverty eradication and national development. For 
renewable energy to remain relevant, the policies adopted must propel it to a level, 
where it provides services that will facilitate the achievement of national 
development goals. 
2. Reliability, Efficiency and Sustainability 
The deployment of renewable energy technologies should be done in such a way 
that they provide reliable and efficient services to consumers. This will bring 
confidence within consumers regarding RETs, thus enhancing the sustainability of 
their market. gy y, y p
The support for renewable energy development and use should be seen as a 
deliberate effort to achieve energy supply diversity, which will enhance energy 
security. This will also increase Uganda’s energy independence through reduced 
foreign oil imports. 
4. Public-Private Partnerships 
Government is expected to provide a conducive policy legal and regulatory 
environment for the private sector to be attracted to invest in renewable energy 
development. The framework for this environment should contain, among other 
things, such incentives as guarantees or risk hedging mechanisms, tax rebates, 
subsidies, favorable power purchase/pricing terms, forex exhange conversion 
terms among others. However, the policy framework should also allow for 
Government’s pro-active implementation of desirable projects, which may not have 
attracted the private sector upfront. The private sector can then be brought on 
board for management and operations of the project. Depending on the 
circumstances of the project, the private sector could be a profit oriented company, 
a cooperative, a community, or an NGO. 
5. Full Cost Accounting 
Pricing policies will be based on full economic, social and environmental costs and 
benefits of policies, plans, programs, projects and activities of energy production 
and utilization. 
6. Avoided Cost Energy Pricing 
With regard to electricity generated from renewable energy sources, the use of the 
avoided cost principle for the feed-in-tariffs will be critical to make renewable 
energy generation competitive, with generation from conventional energy sources. 
7. The Gender Dimension 
Women will need to play a special role in the provision and management of energy 
sources, since they are the most affected by inadequate energy supplies. The 
difference in interests, needs and priorities that women have compared to those of 
men will be recognized in planning, implementation and monitoring of renewable 
energy projects. Energy technologies and services will be designed and 
disseminated in ways that take into consideration the difference in tasks and roles Appropriate policy mechanisms will be provided as part of the enabling 
environment. 
8. Stakeholder Participation and the Poor 
Government and project developers should foster community participation in 
renewable energy projects and strive to promote knowledge of and greater 
acceptance by the public of prospective renewable energy projects that are 
appropriate for their location. This involvement should start at an early stage in the 
planning process. These developments should take into account the socioeconomic set up of the concerned community, including the needs of the poor. The 
development of the renewable energy resources should lead to employment 
creation and poverty alleviation. 
9. Market Competitiveness 
The high upfront costs of investment in RETs make them uncompetitive in the 
market. The Policy will enhance the penetration of renewable energy in the market. 
10. Environmental Sustainability 
The environmental sustainability of energy supply and consumption, including from 
renewable sources, should be enhanced to reduce environmental impacts in terms 
of land use, greenhouse gases and health hazards. While it is generally accepted 
that renewable energy is environmentally friendly, its production must conform to 
acceptable environmental standards.
3.4 The Policy Objectives 
In order to achieve the Policy Vision and Goal, Government will endeavour to implement 
the following objectives:
i) Develop, implement, maintain and continuously improve the legal and 
institutional framework that responds to the prevailing conditions, in order to 
maintain interest in renewable energy investments. 
ii) Establish an appropriate financing and fiscal policy framework that will 
attract more investments in Renewable Energy Technologies. 
iii) Mainstream gender and poverty issues in renewable energy development 
strategies to improve the socio-economic well being of women and the poor appropriate institutions. 
v) Promote Research and Development, technology transfer, international cooperation and adoption of standards in RETs. 
vi) Manage the biomass resource base in a sustainable manner.
vii) Promote the use of biofuels.
viii) Promote the conversion of municipal and industrial wastes to energy.

The targets for the first four strategies are by the end of 2007. The target for the fifth and 
sixth is by end of 2008. The target for the seventh strategy is by end of 2007. The target 
for the last strategy is by end of 2008. 
3.5.8 Wastes to Energy 
To promote the conversion of municipal and industrial waste to energy, Government will: 
1. Provide incentives for the conversion of wastes to energy. 
2. Put in place fiscal measures that will discourage open burning or disposal of wastes 
without extracting their energy content. 
Targets 
The targets for both strategies is by the end of 2007

5. main programmes will be implemented. 
4.1 Power Generation Programme 
Under this programme, there will be two approaches of project realization. The first will 
deal with large hydropower schemes and the second will deal with small power schemes. 
i) Large-scale Power Projects
These sites will be tendered out to prospective developers. After the selection, the 
prospective developer will acquire a license from the Electricity Regulatory Authority to 
carry out feasibility studies and designs. Once these are approved, the developer will 
arrange an appropriate financing package that will facilitate the implementation of the 
scheme. Public Private Partnerships will be encouraged and the tariffs will be negotiated 
on a case by case basis. 
ii) Small-scale Power Projects 
This will cover small hydropower plants (less than 20MW), biomass, co-generation, 
geothermal energy, wind power, solar thermal electric power and other sources. Projects 
in a number of these renewable energy areas are already underway. The programme will 
include basic studies on identified resources, promotion or tendering of sites to the private 
sector and development of projects by the private sector. Public private partnerships will 
be encouraged. According to the Electricity Act 1999, UETCL will determine and publish 
the feed in tariffs after approval by ERA.
a) Biomass-fired Cogeneration: 
Biomass-fired cogeneration will be supported in isolated communities with good 
biomass reserves, industries with large amounts of combustible wastes as well 
as industries that require both heat and electricity. These include the sugar, 
wood, tea, food and beverages, vegetable oil, rice and fish smoking industries. 
b) Wind Power: 
Wind power technology shall be promoted for power generation, water pumping 
and other applications. 
c) Peat: 
This will include licensing of companies to extract peat. Distributed peat-fired 
tiill btd iidtid iltd tg g, ppg y , 
e) Solar: 
This covers solar PV systems as well as solar thermal electric power schemes 
that are grid connected or connected to mini-grids. 
 iii) Legal and Institutional Framework 
For this programme to work, Government will take the following actions: 
a) Provide to the private sector project developers who want to feed power into the 
grid a Standardized Power Purchase Agreement. The significance of this type of 
PPA is that it makes the business predictable by removing market uncertainty, 
facilitates negotiations between the developer and dramatically cuts down the 
transaction costs. This will also help to attract a larger number of investors in 
renewable energy generation. Experiences in other countries where this instrument 
has been used bear these facts out. The Standard Power Purchase Agreement 
(PPA) is shown in Annex 1. 
b) Establish a Feed-in-Tariff, based on the principle of avoided cost pricing, in 
accordance with the provisions of the Electricity Act 1999. The tariff should be able 
to translate into a csh revenue that will not require the investor to resort to a capital 
subsidy. The Feed-in-Tariff will be part of the Standardized PPA. The feed-in tariff 
will be structured to differentiate between peak, shoulder and off-peak prices to 
reflect the higher value of power in the peak period and between short- to mediumterm prices and long-term prices, to reflect the higher risk of load shedding in the 
short to medium-term. The structure for 2007 is shown in Annex 2. In terms of 
price levels, the following principles shall apply: 
i. Prices should provide a weighted average price equivalent to the cost 
of new base load hydropower capacity in Uganda, adjusted for 
transmission losses. 
ii. In the short to medium term, prices should be based on the estimated 
marginal costs of production. 
c) Wheeling of power over third party networks, will be charged in accordance with 
rates set and published by ERA. i. In the case where a grid-embedded project also sells power to 
consumers in the local area, a subsidy per connection will be given. 
ii. Mini-grids, i.e. where generation and distribution are combined in 
remote areas from the main grid. In both this and the case above, the 
subsidy payment will be in line with the subsidy criteria established 
by REA. 
e) Ensure that all Government authorities, who are supposed to provide the various 
consents (including permits, licenses, approvals, etc) give them in a well 
coordinated and expeditious manner. 
f) Provide comfort to the private sector investors by using either of the two existing 
financial instruments to hedge their long term borrowing from local financial 
institutions. These instruments are the Refinance Facility at the Bank of Uganda 
and the Credit Support Facility (CSF) (a Public Trust entity). The detailed 
operational modalities of these instruments can be accessed from the various legal 
documents that established them. 
g) Harmonize the institutional roles in the development of renewable energy projects. 
The details are contained in Annex 1.
4.2 Rural and Urban-Poor Electrification Access Programme 
The rural electrification programme has hitherto focused on unserved rural consumers 
both within and outside the UMEME footprint. However, future projects should be 
extended to the urban poor, especially in peri-urban areas, since their conditions are not 
any different from those living in rural areas. The essence of this action is that all poor 
people, regardless of where they live, should be facilitated to engage in productive 
activities and also receive decent social services such as health, education and water 
supply as a deliberate effort in support of the attainment of the MDGs. 
Government actions on this programme will include the following: 
a) Match the development of small renewable energy generation capacity to the 
corresponding extension of electricity to rural and urban-poor connections. This 
linkage is justified specifically in the context of the design of the ERT Programme, (PREPS), the Locally/Community Initiated Rural Electrification Projects 
(LIREPS/CIREPS) and the extension of grid electricity to agricultural enterprises. 
b) Using the Indicative Rural Electrification Master Plan (IREMP), identify and carry 
out feasibility studies on micro/mini hydro sites and other sources to provide power 
to mini-grids in remote areas, either managed by communities/cooperatives or 
local entrepreneurs. In particular, this grid-independent approach has the potential 
to provide electricity to more rural consumers than relying on grid extensions, 
during periods of capacity constraint on the grid 
c) Through the National Energy Committee (NEC), MEMD will coordinate and monitor 
cross-sectoral energy activities, especially those initiated under the ERT, to ensure 
that the plans for energy services implemented by the sectoral ministries become 
sustainable. The main sectors include health, education, water supply and 
agriculture. 
d) Detail the light regulatory framework provided for under the Electricity Act and the 
necessary institutional framework for the promotion of decentralized schemes, the 
majority of, which are likely to be based on renewable energy generation. The 
framework will include the procedure for licensing/registration, tariff structure 
(specifics depending on case by case) and management and operation. The 
management of these schemes is likely to be done by local rural communities or 
local entrepreneurs. 
4.3 Modern Energy Services Programme 
This programme will involve the promotion of renewable energy based energy technology 
for households, institutions, commercial buildings and small scale industries. In particular, 
these services will be for cooking, lighting, motive power and ICT. While LPG is not a 
renewable energy source, it will also be promoted as an integrated part of the 
programme, since it is a modern and relatively clean fuel, similar to modern renewable 
energy. Specifically, technologies under this programme will cover solar PV systems, 
biomass gasifiers, solar water heaters, efficient woodfuel stoves, LPG appliances and 
energy saving bulbs. Efforts to promote solar PV technology are already under 
implementation within the ERT Programme, while the wood fuel stoves project has been 
Gfactions: 
a) An energy needs assessment, of selected districts in each of the four regions of the 
country. Initial data will be acquired from the District Population Offices, UNBS, NFA, 
MAAIF, MEMD and NGOs and CBOs operating in the different districts. This data 
will be augmented by additional surveys. For the more urbanized districts, data will 
be obtained from the town or municipal offices. The data obtained will be analyzed to 
specify the current energy demand in relation to the supply by the various 
technologies and the affordability of upgrading their supply. 
b) The Directorate of Energy Development will designate specific officers to manage a 
cluster of districts before District Energy Offices are instituted under the District 
Local Governments. They will work with the LCs, NGOs, CBOs, the Private Sector, 
MFIs to develop an implementation plan. 
c) The promotion of the programme will be at the District Level with participation of the 
District Community Development Officer, District Water Officer, District Environment 
Officer, District Education Officer and District Director, Medical Services. These 
officers will work with the District Leaders and sensitize households through the LC 
system. Schools, training institutions, health centers will be also sensitized. 
d) At the District Level a District Energy Committee (DEC) will be established with the 
District Energy Officer as chairperson. It will include representatives of key social 
sectors that require energy. These are the District Water Officer, the District 
Education Officer, the District Director of Medical Services and the District 
Agricultural Officer. At the Sub county Level (LC3), a Local Energy Committee (LEC) 
will also be established. The LEC will manage the planning, implementation, 
operation and maintenance of energy projects. This will include the selection of the 
most appropriate energy supply technology, taking into account affordability, 
willingness to pay, efficiency and sustainability. At the Village Level, a Village Energy 
Committee (VEC) will be established. The representation on both the LEC and VEC 
will be gender sensitive. 
e) There will be grants and revolving funds provided to the beneficiaries. The 
microfinance institutions will provide loans both to households and to institutions who 
would like to purchase solar PV systems and biogas digesters. They will also 
provide loans to potential dealers in solar equipment and liquid petroleum gas charcoal business. 
f) The PSFU, UREA and USSIA will spearhead capacity building for local artisans to 
acquire technological and entrepreneurial skills to manage businesses in or wood 
stoves, charcoal stoves and charcoal production. These will be identified through the 
LC system. 
 The training of technicians in solar pv technology will continue with support from 
MEMD and the Private Sector Foundation Uganda. le 4.1 Modern Energy Services Programme: Main Components

Co-ordination Monitoring and Evaluation 4.4 Biofuels Programme 
This will cover production of ethanol, biodiesels, methanol (gasification) and 
biogas. Initiatives have been undertaken in the past in all these biofuels, but 
without the necessary thrust to make them an integral part of the country’s energy 
supply mix. Uganda has the potential to produce substantial amounts of biodiesel 
from a variety of oil seed crops, which are either already grown for oil extraction or 
growing wildly. The Ministry envisages that Uganda will be able to cut its diesel and 
gasoline imports by 10,000 tons a year from 2007 as a result of supporting 
biodiesel and ethanol production, through a package of policy and regulatory 
measures. Considering the current trend in the price of oil on the world market, 
MEMD will have to move fast to put this programme in place. Under this 
programme, Government will take the following actions: 
a) Appropriate legislation for the use of biofuels will be put in place. This will 
specify, who is eligible for a licence to blend and sell biofuels, the licensing 
authority, the minimum standards of the biofuels. The licencing authority will 
be the Commissioner Petroleum Supplies. Standards will be developed 
together with the Uganda National Bureau of Standards. The UNBS will 
have a biofuels testing facility set up. Together with the Ministry, they will be 
responsible for monitoring the standards of biofuels. 
b) MEMD with stakeholders will promote the use of biofuels through 
sensitization of the stakeholders. The key stakeholders involved will include 
the Private Sector Foundation Uganda, the Uganda Manufacturers 
Association, NGOs CBOs and the oil companies. The promotion will include, 
radio, TV and the print media. 
c) MEMD with Ministry of Agriculture Animal Industry and Fisheries, the 
Ministry of Water and Environment and stakeholders, will develop a 
comprehensive strategy for the increased production of vegetable oil and 
ethanol. This strategy will be implemented with the support of the Private 
Sector Foundation, Uganda Manufacturers Association, Uganda Seed 
Company, NGOs and CBOs. This will include subsidies to the farmers of all 
forms of vegetable oil. With recommendations from MEMD, the Ministry of 
Finance, Planning and Economic Development, will remove taxes from the biofuels and give a tax holiday for the importation of machinery and 
equipment from licensed manufacturers. 
4.5 Wastes to Energy Programme 
This will cover the conversion of waste to energy through direct combustion, 
gasification or biological conversion to biogas and therefore wastes will become 
part of the energy resource base. To foster this development, MEMD will work with 
municipal authorities and industries that generate lots of waste in developing this 
potential. 
a) A survey of the amount and type of waste will be carried out in the various 
municipalities to determine the type of technology and the associated costs 
that are required, with the help of consultants. 
b) The promoters will access financial support from Development Banks, 
Commercial Banks and MFIs and the Credit Support Facility. 
c) Appropriate incentives shall be put in place to promote the conversion of 
waste to energy. This could be through the Credit Support Facility (CSF), 
tax waivers, etc. On the other hand, regulations that will discourage open 
burning or disposal of wastes without extracting their energy content will 
also be put in place. 
4.6 Energy Efficiency Programme 
The Energy Efficiency Programme will implement the overall Energy Efficiency 
Strategy for Uganda, which has the following objectives: 
i. Highlighting the energy efficiency baselines for Uganda. 
ii. Defining energy efficiency targets for Uganda. 
iii. Recommending energy efficiency strategy activities. 
iv. Setting up an energy efficiency implementation plan. 
v. Setting up a framework for energy efficiency improvement and for 
continuous promotion of energy efficiency in Uganda. 
With the objective of improving the energy efficiency in all sectors of the Ugandan economy in a sustainable manner, the Energy Efficiency Strategy for Uganda is
based on three pillars or areas of intervention, namely 
• Education and Training, 
• Information, and 
• Financial Support and Motivation Programmes.
The Government of Uganda will engage in individual activities and programmes for 
each of these areas, targeting the different sectors of the Ugandan economy. 
Where applicable and required, legislative provisions will be undertaken for the 
implementation of the activities and programmes. 
 In order to achieve the goals, objectives and targets of the Energy Efficiency 
Strategy, specific programmes will be implemented for the relevant sectors of the 
Ugandan economy. These are:
• Households and Institutions – households in the rural and urban 
areas, governmental institutions including schools, hospitals, 
universities, ministries and all kinds of administration buildings 
• Industry and Commerce – large industry as well as small and 
medium enterprises, hotels, banks, private offices and small 
commerce 
• Transport – private motorized transport, public transport, freight 
transport as well as transport infrastructure 
• Power Generation, Transmission and Distribution –this will be done 
through the public utilities of UEGCL, UETCL and UEDCL together 
with their concessionaires.
The responsibilities for the implementation of this Strategy rest mainly with 
Government organizations, but will also be shared in some cases with private 
organizations. 
The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development will have lead responsibility 
within the National Government through the new Energy Efficiency and 
Conservation Department, for developing and implementing the Energy Efficiency 
Strategy. 
Other Government bodies that will assist in implementing the various elements of The Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, will be responsible 
for making any changes in rates of company or individual tax and in VAT and 
import duties; 
The Ministry of Works and Transport, will be responsible for taking direct action 
with respect to energy efficiency in the Transport Sector assisted on technical 
matters, by the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Department. 
The Ministry of Education and Sports, will be directly responsible for introducing 
curricula changes to emphasize energy efficiency at all levels of education and 
assisted by the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Department. 
The Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development, will be directly involved 
with the introduction and monitoring for compliance with new energy efficient 
building codes; 
The Ministry of Tourism, Trade and Industry, will participate in aspects of the 
strategy relevant to industrial plants. 
The Ministry of Local Government will facilitate the participation of municipalities 
and other appropriate local jurisdictions. 
The Ministry of Water and Environment and NEMA will facilitate the development 
of appropriate legislation to support the strategy. 
Other main stakeholders will include UMA, PSFU, USSIA, industrial enterprises, 
industry associations, transport companies, owners of school buildings, hospitals 
and commercial centers, financial organizations, equipment manufacturers and 
similar organizations. 
4.7 Impact of Proposed Actions 
The impact of implementing the proposed actions has been evaluated. 
The impact of introducing Improved Biomass Energy Technologies (BETs) is 
shown in Table 4.2. The progressive savings in terms of biomass by 2017 is nearly 
equivalent to the current biomass demand for the entire country, which is at 
approximately, 27,784,000 tons per annum. (c. f Table 2.3) Table: 4.3 Impacts of Proposed Actions

5.1 Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development 
The overall responsibility for this policy lies with the Ministry of Energy and Mineral 
Development (MEMD). The Ministry will oversee and coordinate the 
implementation of this policy by various stakeholders and will ensure the 
effectiveness of these activities. 
Within the ministry, a Renewable Energy Department is being created to 
specifically focus on the promotion of RE and RETs. MEMD shall also work with 
municipal authorities and industries that generate lots of waste in developing the 
potential. 
The functions of the Department are: 
i) To identify new sources of energy to be developed in Uganda 
ii) To collect and process the information concerning renewable energy 
resources. 
iii) To carry out pre-feasibility and pre-investment studies of the various 
sources and sites. 
iv) To mobilize technical assistance and funding for the development of the 
sources. 
v) To develop and review renewable energy policies. 
vi) To promote and develop appropriate renewable energy technologies. 
vii) To provide technical support to local governments and other 
stakeholders. 
viii) To supervise projects in renewable energy. 
ix) To adopt standards and codes of practice for renewable energy 
technologies. 
x) To facilitate the transfer of renewable energy technology. 
Since renewable energy and energy efficiency are being implemented in a holistic 
and integrated manner, it is necessary to strengthen the energy efficiency and conservation functions of the Ministry, by the creation of an Energy Efficiency and 
Conservation Department. 
The main functions of the new Department will be: 
i) To regularly collect, analyze and interpret data on the status of energy 
efficiency and conservation throughout the country. 
ii) To develop strategies and programmes to improve energy efficiency and 
conservation. 
iii) To implement and monitor programmes that intend to improve energy 
efficiency and conservation. 
iv) To recommend and develop standards that can be used to improve energy 
efficiency and conservation. 
v) To coordinate and conduct research on the measures to improve energy 
efficiency and conservation. 
vi) To provide advice and technical guidance to energy users on the best 
practices of energy efficiency and conservation. 
vii) To provide technical advice to other Government Departments, Local 
Governments, the Private Sector and other stakeholders on energy 
efficiency and conservation. 
viii) To disseminate information on energy efficiency and conservation to the 
public and translate this into local languages. 
Furthermore, a National Energy Committee will be established to provide strategic 
policy guidance to the Sector. 
5.2 Other Stakeholders 
The other main stakeholders include the Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA), 
which sets the tariffs and issues licenses for studies, generation and distribution, 
according to the Electricity Act 1999. The Rural Electrification Agency (REA) is the 
secretariat of the Rural Electrification Board (REB), which manages the Rural 
Electrification Fund (REF). The REF provides subsidies to support rural 
electrification projects. The Uganda Electricity Transmission Company (UETCL) is 
the System Operator and owns the transmission mains of above 33KV on behalf of of the electricity distribution network, which is being managed by UMEME, the 
concessionaire. Investments by Government will belong to UEDCL. The Uganda 
Electricity Generation Company (UEGCL) is the owner the Kiira and Nalubaale 
Power stations at Owen Falls, which have now been concessioned to Eskom 
Globeq to manage them. 
The Uganda National Bureau of Standards (UNBS) is responsible for developing 
and monitoring standards for renewable energy technologies in addition to biofuels 
technology. The National Environment Management Agency (NEMA) is 
responsible for regulating the impact of renewable investments on the 
environment, through instruments like environment impact assessment (EIA). The 
Directorate of Water Development (DWD) is responsible for issuing permits for 
water extraction for hydropower schemes. 
The Private Sector Foundation (PSFU) is a body that brings together private 
companies will assist in project development. The Uganda Investment Authority 
(UIA) provides both foreign and local investors with licenses for investment. Other 
bodies, which will participate in implementing this Policy are the Uganda 
Manufacturers Association (UMA), which is a body that brings together key users 
of renewable energy and potential manufacturers of the equipment; the Uganda 
Renewable Energy Association (UREA), which brings together companies, NGOS 
and CBOs that are implementing renewable energy projects. The Uganda Small 
Scale Industries Association (USSIA) will also participate through its members. The 
Media Houses, which include the radio, print and TV will also participate in the 
sensitization campaigns. 
Other Government ministries involved in the provision of renewable energy 
technologies for social services are the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Finance, 
Planning and Economic Development, Ministry of Education and Sports, Ministry of 
Water and Environment, National Forestry Authority, Ministry of Agriculture, Animal 
Industries and Fisheries, Ministry of Local Government, the District Local 
Governments and the Municipalities. 
Special financial mechanisms have been instituted to facilitate rural electrification 
and renewable energy investments. This includes the Credit Support Facility 
(CSF) known as the Uganda Energy Capitalization Trust that has been instituted to 
provide partial guarantees for private sector borrowing from the local financial markets to develop projects. Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) will include 
Commercial Banks, Development Banks and Microfinance Institutions (MFIs). 6 FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS 
6.1 Short- and Medium-Term Policy Priority Actions 
Several RE Policy actions will be implemented in order to achieve the broad and 
specific objectives of this RE Policy. The details are indicated in Table 6.1. 
Strategic interventions required to move forward the RE policy priority actions are 
indicated along the proposed actions. 
The total financial resources required to implement the strategic interventions are 
of the order of UShs 6,500 billion or US$ 3.5 billion over the next ten years. It is 
estimated that 86% of these resources will come from direct private investment, 
while 14% have to be obtained from the public sector either through Government 
resources or from development partners (e.g. Multilateral and Bilateral cooperation, 
Global Environment Facility, Clean Development Mechanism). In particular, 
Government will strive to take advantage of these environmental agencies by 
emphasizing the development of renewable energy resources. Table 6.2 gives a 
summary of this. Table 6.1 Short and Medium (0 – 10 Years) Term RE Policy Priorities (2007 - 2017)

GENCO more than three (3) times in any period of nine (9) consecutive Months, and 
to the extent that the disputes are found to be valid by GENCO or by an Arbitrator, 
then the Parties shall meet at the request of either Party to discuss and resolve the 
causes of the persistent billing errors. 
If UETCL disputes any amount specified in any Billing Period Invoice presented by the 
GENCO more than three (3) times in any period of nine (9) months and such disputes 
are found to be invalid by GENCO or by an Arbitrator, then UETCL shall be liable to 
pay all the direct costs incurred by GENCO which may accrue as a result of such 
disputed Billing Period Invoice. 
No Set-off 
All payment by UETCL to GENCO under this Agreement shall be made without 
deduction or withholding (except to the extent required by law) on account of any 
other amount, whether by way of set-off or otherwise, unless deductible under the 
express provisions of this Agreement or pursuant to a valid Court Order, provided that 
nothing in Sub-clause 0 shall prevent GENCO from bringing an action in respect of 
any contractual dispute. 
Liquidated Damages 
If GENCO is prevented from delivering Energy to UETCL as a result of a failure of the 
UETCL System, UETCL shall pay GENCO Liquidated Damages; Provided that 
Liquidated Damages shall not be payable where the failure of the UETCL is due to 
scheduled maintenance. 
For the purpose of this Agreement, failure of the UETCL System due to scheduled 
maintenance shall be limited to [872] hours per Contract Year. 
Liquidated Damages for a Month payable by UETCL shall be determined as the 
average Energy Charge of the preceding three Billing Period Invoices, divided by 
seven hundred and thirty (730), multiplied by the number of Hours in the Month that 
the GENCO was unable to delivery Energy to UETCL as a result of a failure of the 
UETCL System. 
The Target Availability for GENCO is [ninety five percent (95%)]. 
Availability of the GENCO generator in any year shall be determined as the ratio of the 
hours during the year when the generator was available to generate to the potential 
number of operating hours. The potential number of operating hours shall be the 
number of hours in the year less the number of hours during which the generator was 
not available due to hydrological constraints. 
If the availability of the GENCO generator is below the Target Availability in any 
calendar year; GENCO shall pay UETCL Liquidated Damages. 
Liquidated Damages payable by GENCO shall be calculated as the product of the lost 
output due to availability below the Target Availability and the average Energy Charge 
of the preceding twelve Billing Period Invoices divided by seven hundred and thirty 
(730). Undertakings and Warranties of the Parties

limited to, a Party’s inability to make a profit or achieve a satisfactory rate of return 
due to the provisions of this Agreement or changes in market conditions (although the 
inability to use available funds, due to any reason set out in Sub-clause 0 above, shall 
be regarded as Force Majeure); 
late delivery of machinery or other materials or a delay in the performance by any 
contractor or supplier (except where such late delivery or delay is itself attributable to 
a Force Majeure Event); 
normal wear and tear or random flaws in materials and equipment or breakdown in 
equipment; 
hazards, including but not limited to lightning or the growth of trees, which can be 
reasonably anticipated in normal utility operations and planned for as part of Prudent 
Operating Practice. 
In case of an event of Force Majeure 
If a Party ("the affected Party") is prevented from or delayed in performing an 
obligation hereunder by reason of Force Majeure the affected Party shall: 
be relieved from the requirement to perform that obligation; 
promptly notify the other Party of the occurrences of the event within ninety six (96) 
hours giving full particulars and satisfactory evidence in support of its claim; and in the 
event of a break down of communication rendering it not reasonably practicable to 
give notice of Force Majeure within the period specified above, the Party claiming 
Force Majeure may give such notice as soon as possible, but not later than twenty 
four (24) hours of reinstatement of communication; and 
use all reasonable endeavours to overcome the consequences of the event and 
where the Force Majeure Event has been eliminated or no longer affects a Party, the obligations in this Agreement shall recommence forthwith, and the applicable period 
for the performance of the obligation shall be extended by a period equal to the 
duration of the Force Majeure Event. 
The declaration of Force Majeure shall not relieve any Party from the requirement to 
make any payment when due. 
If either Party is prevented, hindered or delayed in the performance of material 
obligations under this Agreement by reason of Force Majeure occurring after the 
Commercial Operation Date, then provided the affected Party has complied with its 
obligations under this Clause 0, the Term shall be extended by a period in time equal 
to the period during which the affected Party was so prevented, hindered or delayed, 
in accordance with Clause 0. 
Termination 
Event of Default 
Each of the following events shall be a GENCO Event of Default which, if not cured 
within the time permitted in this Clause shall give rise to the right on the part of UETCL 
to terminate this agreement:

hundred and eighty (180) days following notice by GENCO stating that a material 
breach of this Agreement has occurred and identifying the breach in question; 
The filing of a petition of bankruptcy of UETCL. 
The provisions of this Clause 0 shall be the sole and exclusive grounds on which the 
Parties may terminate this Agreement save for a circumstance of Force Majeure that 
has occurred and shall continue for a period of one hundred and eighty two (182) days 
from the issue of the notice of occurrence of Force Majeure Event by the Party, then, 
any Party shall be entitled to serve upon the other twenty-eight (28) days’ notice to 
terminate this Agreement. If at expiry of such period of twenty-eight (28) days Force 
Majeure shall still continue this Agreement shall terminate. 
Termination Notices 
Upon occurrence of a UETCL Event of Default or a GENCO Event of Default, as the 
case may be, that is not cured within the applicable period (if any) for cure, the non-defaulting party may, at its option, initiate termination of this Agreement by delivering a 
written notice (“Notice of Intent to Terminate”) of its intent to terminate this Agreement 
to the defaulting party. The Notice of Intent to Terminate shall specify in reasonable 
detail the UETCL Event of Default or the GENCO Event of Default, as the case may 
be, giving rise to the Notice of Intent to Terminate. 
Following the giving of a Notice of Intent to Terminate, the Parties shall consult for a 
period of forty five (45) days in case of a failure by either party to make payments or 
provide security when due, and ninety (90) days with respect to any other Event of 
Default (or such longer period as the Parties mutually may agree), as to what steps 
shall be taken with a view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event taking 
into account all prevailing circumstances. During the period following delivery of the 
Notice of Intent to Terminate, the party in default may continue to undertake efforts to 
cure the default, and if the default is cured at anytime prior to the delivery of a 
Termination Notice in accordance with Sub-clause 0, then the non-defaulting Party 
shall have no right terminate this Agreement in respect of such cured default. 
Upon expiration of the consultation period described in Sub-clause 0, if any, and 
unless the Parties shall have otherwise agreed or unless the UETCL Event of Default 
or GENCO Event of Default giving rise to the Notice of Intent to Terminate shall have 
been remedied the Party having given the Notice of Intent to Terminate may terminate 
this Agreement by delivering a Termination Notice to the other Party, whereupon this 
Agreement shall immediately terminate. 
Payments in the Event of Termination 
Any Party shall be liable to and shall indemnify the other Parties for the loss or 
damage directly and foreseeable suffered by the other Parties as a result of 
termination of this Agreement due to that Party’s Event of Default. Provided that the 
loss or damage suffered by either Party, if disputed by the other Party, shall have 
been determined by an Arbitrator in accordance with the dispute resolution procedure 
under Clause 0. Provided further that the loss determined by the Arbitrator does not 
exceed [US$ 500,000] in any given year.

Check Meter and showing the location of the Metering Point in each case. SCHEDULE 2: DETERMINATION OF METERED QUANTITIES 
Reading of Meters 
The Main Meter and the Check Meters at the Interconnection Point, shall be read at 
12:00 on the first Day of each successive Month (or such other Day as may be 
mutually agreed upon by the Parties). GENCO shall read the Main and Check Meters 
during normal business hours and shall notify UETCL at least forty-eight (48) hours in 
advance of the time of reading in order to afford UETCL the opportunity to be present 
during the reading. GENCO shall provide a copy of the readings to UETCL either by 
fax, courier or other appropriate means, and shall keep a log of the readings at the 
Interconnection Point and in the GENCO offices. 
The readings of the Main Meter shall be used in the preparation of all invoices unless 
the Main Meter was not in service for a portion of the Month in question as a result of 
maintenance, repairs or testing, or is otherwise known to be inaccurate or functioning 
improperly. In such event, the following procedures will be followed in the stated 
order: 
The readings of the Check meter shall be utilised to calculate the correct Metered 
Energy quantities, unless a test of such Check Meter as required by either Party, 
reveals that the Check Meter is inaccurate by more than two-tenths of a percent 
(±0.2%), or is otherwise functioning improperly. 
If the Check Meter is found to be inaccurate by more than two-tenths of a percent 
(±0.2%) or is otherwise functioning improperly, then GENCO and UETCL shall jointly 
prepare an estimate of the correct reading on the basis of all available information and 
such guidelines as may have been agreed to for the handling of such matters; 
In the event that the readings of either the Main or Check meter have been relied 
upon for the preparation of invoices and such meter is subsequently found to have 
been inaccurate or otherwise functioning improperly, the invoices which relied upon 
the erroneous meter shall be corrected for the inaccurate readings by reference to a 
meter whose readings were known to be accurate within plus or minus two-tenths of 
one percent (±0.2%) for the period during which the meter was inaccurate, if such 
period can be determined. In the event no there is no alternative meter whose reading 
can be relied upon, the erroneous readings shall be corrected by the error in excess of 
two-tenths of one percent (±0.2%) determined by testing of the erroneous meter. If the 
period of inaccuracy cannot be accurately determined, it shall be deemed to be half 
the period between the date the meter was found to be inaccurate and the date of the 
last meter reading accepted by the Parties as accurate, or three months, whichever is 
the shorter period. In no event, however, shall any such adjustment be made for any 
period prior to the date on which the subject meter was last tested and found to be 
accurate within plus or minus two-tenths of one percent (±0.2%) and not otherwise 
functioning improperly. 
Determination of Energy Quantities 
The meter readings shall be used to determine the following monthly energy 
quantities: 
The Peak Metered Energy for the month will be the increase in meter reading for the 
Peak Block since the meter reading of the previous month; 
The Shoulder Metered Energy for the month will be the increase in meter reading for 
the Shoulder Block since the meter reading of the previous month; 
The Off-Peak Metered Energy for the month will be the increase in meter reading for 
the Off-Peak Block since the meter reading of the previous month. 
Definition of TOU Blocks The Peak Block shall be between 18:00 and 23:00 every day of the week. 
The Shoulder Block shall be between 05:00 and 18:00 every day of the week. 
The Off-Peak Block shall be between 23:00 and 05:00 every day of the week. SCHEDULE 3: DETERMINATION OF PAYMENTS 
Energy Prices 
Energy prices are expressed in US Dollar per MWh and are specified for three timeof-use blocks as defined in Schedule 2, and for two periods, each period being a set 
of Years. The set of power prices are shown below. 
 Period 1: XXX to XXX Period 2: XXX to XXX 
Peak Price 
Shoulder 
Price 
 
Off-peak 
Price 
 
Exchange rate 
The exchange rate to be used for determination of the monthly Energy Charge (the 
“Monthly Exchange rate”) shall be the average of the official buying and selling 
exchange rate of the US Dollar to the UG Shilling posted by the Bank of Uganda on 
the last working day of the month. 
Energy Charge 
The Peak energy charge shall be calculated as the product of the prevailing Peak 
Price in US Dollars per MWh and the Peak Metered Energy for the month in MWh. 
The Shoulder energy charge shall be calculated as the product of the prevailing 
Shoulder Price in US Dollars per MWh and the Shoulder Metered Energy for the 
month in MWh. 
The Off-peak Energy Charge shall be calculated as the product of the prevailing Offpeak Price in US Dollars per MWh and the Off-peak Metered Energy for the month in 
MWh. 
The Energy Charge for a specific Month shall be calculated as the equivalent in UG 
Shillings of the sum of the Peak Energy Charge, the Shoulder Energy Charge and the 
Off-Peak Energy Charge for that Month; multiplied by the Monthly Exchange rate for 
that Month. SCHEDULE 4: METER SPECIFICATIONS 
Metering System Requirements 
The Main/Check meter system to be installed, owned and maintained by GENCO at 
the Interconnection Point shall each consist of a single set of three current 
transformers and potential transformers feeding both a primary and a backup three 
phase four wire metering instrument. The system shall be designed such that the 
overall error of the installation, (including instrument transformers, wiring, and 
metering instruments) shall be no greater than 0.5% for power flows through the 
metering installation between 600kW and 20000kW. Both the Main and Check Meters 
shall be selected to have rated error no greater than 0.2% over the equivalent load 
range. Both Main and Check Meters shall be electronic time of use (TOU) meters

Table A4.1 Process and Coordination Mechanisms for PREPS and LIREPS/ 
CIREPS 
PHASE PREPS LIREPS/CIREPS 
Initiation REA leads 
identification of 
PREPS with a 
minimum 
involvement of 
ERA. 
Local, foreign Developer 
or communities identifies 
the project and analyses 
the commercial feasibility 
of the project 
Project 
development 
process 
The project is 
tendered to 
potential bidders, 
and the 
successful 
bidder is 
awarded a 
permit by ERA to 
finalise the 
project 
preparation. 
REA consults 
ERA, UETCL, 
MEMD, NEMA 
and other 
authorities in 
preparing the 
project 
documentation 
and doing early 
feasibility 
studies. 
Interaction with 
UETCL should 
confirm interconnection 
options, impact 
on load flow, and 
whether any 
amendments to 
the pro-forma 
PPA are 
required. 
The developer contacts 
ERA and signs a 
Memorandum of 
Understanding (MoU) with 
MEMD. 
The developer consults 
REA, UETCL, NEMA and 
other authorities in 
preparing their project 
documentation. 
Interaction with UETCL 
should confirm interconnection options, 
impact on load flow, and 
whether any amendments 
to the pro-forma PPA are 
required.

submits a project 
brief to NEMA 
for an initial 
reaction. 
REA prepares 
the scoping 
study and 
submits it to 
NEMA, including 
TOR for the EIA 
that will be 
undertaken. 
REA initiates 
negotiations with 
local government 
regarding 
royalties, as 
required in the 
Act. 
Tender 
documents: REA 
prepares the 
documentation 
needed for the 
tender and 
consults with 
ERA as 
appropriate. 
Tender: REA
and ERA jointly 
issue an 
invitation to 
submit 
proposals. 
Due diligence 
and submission: 
Bidders 
complete their 
due diligence 
and prepare their 
submissions 
based on the 
terms of the 
tender. 
ERA and REA 
take a joint 
application to ERA for a 
permit to undertake the 
necessary project 
development. ERA copies 
the permit application to 
REA for information 
purposes. 
The developer prepares 
the scoping study and 
submits it to NEMA, 
including TOR for the EIA 
that will be undertaken. 
NEMA screens projects 
with no significant impact, 
which do not require an 
EIA, and projects for 
which mitigation 
measures can be easily 
identified either directly or 
through an Environmental 
Impact Review (EIR). 
The developer initiates 
negotiations with local 
government regarding 
royalties, as provided in 
the Act. 
NEMA must approve an 
Environmental Impact 
Assessment (EIA) and a 
Resettlement Action Plan 
(RAP) before ERA can 
issue a licence for the 
project. NEMA reviews 
the studies and, if 
approved, issues a 
certificate of approval for 
the project. RAP valuation 
and registration of 
properties is submitted to 
NEMA who in turn 
forwards it to the Chief 
Government Valuer at the 
Land Office. The Land 
Office must approve the 
valuation and registration 
of properties before 
NEMA can approve the 
RAP. appraisal of the 
bids and the 
preferred bidder 
is awarded a 
permit by ERA. 
WRM processes 
applications for a 
Construction Permit and a 
Surface Water 
Abstraction Permit while 
Uganda Investment 
Authority processes the 
application for an 
Investment Licence. 
Once a permit is 
awarded, developers may 
apply to ERT-BUDS for 
support in performing 
feasibility and 
environmental impact 
studies. The ERT-BUDS 
arm of the Private Sector 
Foundation will process 
the application, and if 
successful, arrange for 
payment of a grant. 
License and 
subsidy 
application 
(under 0.5 
MW, no 
licence is 
required; 
between 0.5 
and 2 MW, 
the 
developer 
may apply to 
ERA for 
exemption)
The selected 
bidder completes 
the necessary 
application forms 
for the licence 
and subsidy, and 
submits these to 
ERA and REA 
respectively. 
The developer negotiates 
amendments to the proforma PPA with UETCL, 
and a draft of the final 
PPA is prepared and 
initiated. 
For projects larger than 2 
MW, the developer 
submits a licence and 
subsidy application, 
containing the same 
information in the same 
format. 
The ERA and REA 
undertake jointly a duediligence study of the 
application. 
The REB considers the 
subsidy award by 
evaluating the application 
against its own subsidy 
criteria. 
The decisions (rejection; 
acceptance with or without conditions; 
request to resubmit) are 
communicated to the 
applicant by ERA for 
licence and REA for 
subsidy. 
UETCL Board confirms 
the PPA and it is signed; 
REA and developer 
finalise the subsidy 
contract; and ERA issues 
the licence. The process of implementing the PREPS is summarized in Fig A4.1. 
Selection, Permit award & Final Studies
Selection & permit award: Joint ERA & REA selection of preferred bidder, based on 
competence & financial offer. ERA awards permit.
Project Brief: NEMA categorises project and advises REA. 
Initial project development phase
Project identification. REA leads identification of PREPS based on renewable energy and 
electrification strategy.
Pre-feasibility: REA consults ERA, UETCL, MEMD and NEMA to define project and checks 
feasibility. Where necessary, confirms PPA with UETCL.
Local government royalties: REA negotiates royalties with local government.
Tender documents: REA prepares project tender documents. Consults with ERA.
Tender: ERA & REA to jointly advertise applications for the project. REA provides dataroom 
and responds to queries. 
Licence & Subsidy Award
Enviro scoping & TOR approval: Developer interacts with NEMA during scoping & NEMA 
approves TOR for EIA.
EIA/RAP Approval: NEMA analyses and possibly conditionally approves the EIA and RAP. 
Land Office approves RAP.
Other permits: Developer applies to WRM for Construction Permit and Surface Water 
Permit, and to UIA for Investment Licence.
Studies: Developer undertakes EIA, RAP and any further feasibility/design studies.
Licence/subsidy application: Developer applies for licence and subsidy based on initial 
tender requirements and information from any subsequent project development activities. Any 
changes from initial project design and cost should be highlighted and justified.
Analysis and award: The remaining process is similar to that for LIREPs, with the exception 
that the analysis should be simpler given the earlier tender and evaluation that was 
undertaken previously.
Due diligence & submission: Developers undertake due diligence, prepare submissions 
and submit bids. Figure A4.1 Implementation of the PREPS 
Figures A4.2 and A4.3 show a timeline for the overall development of 
LIREPS and PREPS respectively. ERA must make a decision on the 
permit within 30 days from when they received comments. After the 
license application has been made, ERA is again obliged by the 
Electricity Act to make a public notice and to receive comments from the 
public. The final licence decision must have been made within 180 days 
from receiving the application. Table A4.2 summarizes the different 
documents required for project processing and approval Permit
