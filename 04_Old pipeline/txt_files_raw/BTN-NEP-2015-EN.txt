Under the Ninth Five-year Plan (2002–08), 
the Department of Energy (DoE), Ministry of 
Economic Affairs (formerly Ministry of Trade 
and Industry), undertook a study to prepare an 
Integrated Energy Management Master Plan 
(IEMMP) for Bhutan. This was a Government 
of India assisted study for which The Energy 
and Resources Institute (TERI), New Delhi, was 
appointed as a consultant. 
 In the fi rst phase of the study, Bhutan Energy 
Data Directory 2005 was published, which covered, 
for the fi rst time, the energy demand and supply 
balance for 2005 and potential of energy resources. 
It also reviewed the status of the energy sector, 
including the institutional arrangements. The Data 
Directory included the survey of the residential 
sector and energy audits of major industries. 
 This report, second in the series, analyses a 
wide range of issues, which mainly relate to the 
energy sector of Bhutan. This report presents the 
objectives of the study, approach and methodology, 
future outlook of the energy sector till 2020, 
demand and supply analyses, impacts of energy 
on economy, and interdependence of development 
and energy. Various laws/regulations have also been 
analysed, along with assessment of social impacts 
of supplying energy to rural areas. 
PROJECT OBJECTIVE AND METHODOLOGY
The objective of the IEMMP is to develop an 
all-encompassing framework, which would give 
a holistic overview of the demand and supply 
scenarios, along with recommending strategies (up 
to 2020) for the sustainable supply of energy for 
the socio-economic development of the kingdom,

#BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON BHUTAN
Bhutan is a landlocked country situated between 
India and China in the fragile eastern Himalayas. 
Its population as per Census 2005 is 634 982. 
 Bhutan covers an area of 38 394 km2
, roughly 
spread 140 km north to south and 275 km east 
to west. The altitude varies from 100 m above 
the mean sea level (msl) in the southern tropical 
region to 7550 above the msl in the northern 
alpine region. The country is blessed with natural 
forests and is one of the 10 biodiversity hotspots 
notifi ed by the United Nations (UN). The country 
receives fair amount of rainfall, varying from 
500 mm in the north to 5000 mm in the south. 
Situated in high altitude Himalayas, Bhutan has 
667 glaciers and 2674 glacier lakes,1
 which feed 
four major rivers and their tributaries, making 
the country rich in hydropower resources. These 
geographical features, landlocked condition, and 
unique environment pose unique challenges 
and opportunities for Bhutan as it pursues the 
development of its economy sector. 
 After centuries of isolation, Bhutan 
opened its economy in 1950s and 
started following a path of sustainable 
and cautious development, popularly 
known as the ‘middle path’ of 
development. So far, it has followed 
the path of development sustainably, 
causing minimum damage to the 
environment and ecology. 
 Planned development started in 
1961 when the fi rst Five-year Plan 
was implemented with the help of 
the Government of India. Right from 
Energy sector  an overview
the fi rst Five-year Plan (1961–66) till the Ninth 
Five-year Plan (2002–08),2
 the country has seen 
planned and steady economic development and 
has gone through substantial transformation.
 Indo-Bhutan bilateral relationship plays an 
important role in the development of Bhutanese 
economy. India and Bhutan have had trade relations 
for centuries, and the ties grew stronger after 
the Independence of India in 1947. The historic 
India–Bhutan Treaty of 1949 laid the foundation 
for Indo-Bhutan relations. The power sector, along 
with the health and education sectors, is among the 
major sectors in which India has made signifi cant 
contributions in terms of investment, capacity 
building, and technology transfer. 
BHUTAN’S GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT
The growth rate of the gross domestic product 
(GDP, % per year) of the country, from 2003 to 
2008, is presented in Table 1.

 The Ninth Plan period was extended to 2008 by the Royal Government of Bhutan. Power sector development
Electricity was introduced for the fi rst time in 
Bhutan in 1964 when the fi rst diesel generator sets 
were installed at Pheuntsholing and Samtse. This 
was followed by the development of hydropower, 
and the fi rst hydropower plant with a capacity 
of 360 kW was commissioned in 1967 to supply 
electricity to the capital town of Thimphu. The 
power sector got a boost in 1988 when Chukha 
Hydropower Plant with a capacity of 336 MW was 
commissioned. With the commissioning of Chukha 
Hydropower Plant, Bhutan started exporting 
electricity to India, earnings of which started 
funding its socio-economic development. Today, 
about 45% of its export earnings are through the 
export of electricity, and this earning has also been 
instrumental in the development of infrastructure 
like roads, hospitals, and school, besides providing 
impetus to industrial development. 
 Another major milestone in hydropower 
development was achieved in 2007 when Tala 
Hydropower Plant with a capacity of 1020 MW 
was fully commissioned. 
 Bhutan’s economic growth is closely related to 
the development of its power sector. The phased 
commissioning of the Tala Power Project in 2006 
boosted the GDP growth sharply in 2007. The 
growth was slightly less in 2008, which was due 
to high base effect.
Electricity supply and consumption trends
Some salient features of Bhutan’s electricity sector 
are summarized below.
Power generation in the country in 2005 was 
2521.25 MU, while 18.39 MU of electricity 
was imported. Of the total electricity generated, 
1793.76 MU of electricity was exported and 
745.88 MU was consumed in the country.
Of the total electricity consumed in the country, 
619 MU of power was sold and 112.43 MU of 
the electricity was lost within the system. The 
balance met the auxiliary power requirement in 
the power plants.
Peak demand in 2005 was 120 MW.

electricity. 
Institutional and commercial sectors consumed 
118.88 MU (18.76 % of the total consumption) 
of electricity.
The residential sector consumed 89 MU 
of electricity in 2005 (14.5% of total 
consumption).
The agriculture and transport sectors consume 
negligible amount of electricity.
Electricity constituted 15.7% of the total energy 
supply in the country during 2005.
 Figure 1 shows the electricity consumption in 
different Dzongkhags in 2005.
Fuelwood
The main source of primary energy in Bhutan 
is fuelwood obtained from forests. The country 
consumed 724 597 tonnes of fuelwood during 
2005, which accounted for 56.8% of the total 
primary energy supply. In addition to fuelwood, 
other biomass fuels, which are being used in small 
quantities, include briquettes made from saw dust 
and agriculture residue.
Petroleum fuels
About 19% of the total energy is met from 
imported petroleum fuels like diesel, petrol, 
kerosene, liquefi ed petroleum gas (LPG), furnace 
oil, aviation turbine fuel, light diesel oil (LDO), 
and so on. Diesel and petrol feature amongst the 
top imports in the country on import value basis. 
In 2005, 51 460 kilolitres of diesel was imported 
against the import of 13 879 kilolitres of petrol. In 
addition, during the same year, 12 545 kilolitres of 
kerosene and 4472 million tonnes (MT) of LPG 
were imported. Figures 2 and 3 show trends in the 
import of petroleum fuels.
Coal
Coal meets 8% of the energy demand in the 
country. It is mostly used in the industrial sector. 
The total coal consumption in the country during 
2005 was 97 509 tonnes. The total coal mined 
#
#
#FIGURE 1 ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION IN 2005, BY DZONGKHAG
from local coal mines was 85 279 tonnes, while 
60 607 tonnes of coal was imported in the same 
year. Bhutan also exported 48 377 tonnes of coal 
in 2005.

SECTORAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION
The sectoral energy consumption for 2005 is 
shown in Figure 4.Residential sector
Population distribution
Bhutan’s population of 634 982 (Census 2005) is 
distributed in 20 Dzongkhags. About 69% of this 
population lives in rural areas and 31% lives in 
urban areas. Seventy-fi ve per cent of this population 
is concentrated in nine Dzongkhags, of which six 
are in the western region, two in the central region, 
and only one in the eastern region. Figure 5 shows 
the distribution of population, by Dzongkhag.
 The residential sector accounts for 48.7% of 
the total energy consumption, making it a highest 
energy consumer. The sector’s 91% demand is met 
by biomass, and the remaining 9% is accounted for 
by fuels like LPG, electricity, and kerosene. In the 
residential sector, energy is mainly used for cooking 
(66% of the total residential energy share),4
 which 
is followed by fodder cooking (26%). There is a 
signifi cant difference in the energy consumption 
patterns between the rural and urban areas. 
While rural households primarily depend on 
fi rewood, the urban households rely more on 
electricity and petroleum fuels. 
 Figure 6 shows energy consumption in the 
residential sector, by Dzongkhag. 
Electrification status
As per the 2005 statistics, the country has 126 115 
households, of which 38 311 households are urban 
households and the remaining 87 804 households 
are rural households. Of these, 36 923 urban 
households (96.4%) and 35 140 rural households 
(40%) were electrifi ed, as of 2005. 
 The Royal Government of Bhutan (RGoB) 
is pursuing rural electrifi cation, with one of the 
objectives being reducing fuelwood consumption. 
These rural households consumed 89 MU of 
electricity in 2005, which was 14.6% of the total 
electricity consumption during the same period.

 It should be noted here that in a large number of households, same device is used for both cooking and space heating, making it diffi cult 
to apportion fuel use between the two end uses; in such a case, fuel use is apportioned to cooking. In the Ninth Five-year Plan, as of June 2007, 
15 148 households have been electrifi ed. In the 
Tenth Five-year Plan (2008–13), a total of 43 951 
rural unelectrifi ed households will be electrifi ed, 
thereby resulting in 100% rural electrifi cation.
Fuels and energy resources used in the 
residential sector
The residential sector uses fuelwood, LPG, 
electricity, and kerosene as major fuels. The energy 
consumption in the residential sector in Bhutan 
is dominated by high consumption of fuelwood 
and relatively low use of modern fuels like LPG. 
Additionally, briquettes for space heating are being 
increasingly used in urban areas. On the other 
hand, solar photovoltaic (PV) systems have been 
set up in remote areas for lighting purpose. 
 Major fuel-consuming activities in the residential 
sector are as follows.
Cooking 
Lighting 
Space heating (many times this is done with the 
device that is used for cooking)
Fodder cooking in rural areas
#

Fodder cooking is treated separately at the end of 
this section. 
 Energy consumption for 2005, by fuel and end 
use, as estimated by the survey of 5450 households, 
carried out in Bhutan under the IEMMP project, 
is discussed subsequently.
Consumption analysis, by fuel
Fuelwood 
While the choice of the fuel depends on the 
availability of fuels and their costs, fuelwood is 
the most commonly used fuel in Bhutan and 
constitutes about 90% of the energy used in the 
residential sector. 
 Rural areas have higher percentage of population 
(69%), which is allowed to collect fuelwood free of 
royalty, as per the policy of the RGoB. Rural areas 
are also the largest consumers of fuelwood. A total 
of 69 013 households use fuelwood as the main 
source of cooking fuel (Census 2005).
 Fuelwood is collected mostly by women, and 
survey indicates that on an average, one person 
month per year is spent in collecting fuelwood. A 
survey of household energy consumption carried 
FIGURE 5 DISTRIBUTION OF POPULATION IN BHUTAN (2005)out by TERI under the IEMMP project has 
found that the per capita fuelwood consumption 
in the residential sector is about 0.78 tonne per 
annum, accounting for 68% of the total fuelwood 
consumption in the country. 
 Cooking and space heating are many times 
carried out by using same device, which is 
commonly called bukhari. It uses fuelwood as fuel. 
In urban areas, special types of bukharis are used 
for space heating and water heating.
 Fuelwood consumption, by Dzongkhag, is 
presented in Table 2.
 The table shows that Dzongkhags like 
Trashigang, Mongar, S’Jongkhar, Wangdue and 
Dagana, Samtse, and Chukha together account 
for about 50% of the fuelwood consumed in the 
residential sector. These areas can be targeted 
for implementing special programmes meant to 
reduce fuelwood consumption.
Electricity 
In electrifi ed areas, electricity is the preferred 
fuel for cooking, lighting, and space heating 
applications. 
 It is interesting to note that of the 72 063 
electrifi ed households in Bhutan, 31 510 urban 
households and 25 105 rural households (78.6%) 
use electricity as the main fuel for lighting and 
cooking (Census 2005). This shows that one of 
the objectives of rural electrifi cation – to reduce 
fuelwood consumption – has been achieved 
successfully. Studies have also shown that there 
is about 25% reduction in fuelwood consumption 
in electrifi ed households in rural areas. 
 Cookers and water boilers (or electric kettles) 
are the major cooking equipment used for cooking 
in these households. Besides, these electrifi ed 
households use electric heaters, refrigerators, 
washing machines, and infotainment gadgets like 
TV, music players, and computers. The IEMMP 
survey has come up with the fact that electricity 
is mainly consumed for cooking, space heating, 
and water heating applications in the colder areas. 
Electric heaters used for space heating vary in type 
and quality.
Kerosene 
Kerosene is the third most preferred fuel in 
the residential sector in Bhutan, after fuelwood 
and electricity. In 2005, the residential sector 
consumed 12 545 kilolitres of kerosene (50% 
of the total kerosene used in the country).

use kerosene as the main fuel for lighting. The total 
number of households that use kerosene as the 
main fuel for cooking is 11 342. Use of kerosene 
for space heating is not very common, although 
in urban areas of Thimphu, space heaters based 
on kerosene are available. Because of the adverse 
health impacts of using kerosene for lighting, 
low-cost wick lamps that are commonly used 
for lighting need to be discouraged. Accordingly, 
measures are proposed to reduce the use of 
kerosene for lighting.
Liquefi ed petroleum gas
LPG is mostly used for cooking in the urban areas 
of the country. In 2005, total LPG consumption 
in the residential sector was 3522 tonnes, of which 
2613 tonnes (74%) was consumed in the urban 
sector. 
 LPG is supplied to Bhutan at concessional 
rates. However, the selling price is dependent 
on transport costs, and hence, landed costs are 
substantially higher in rural areas. Moreover, 
often users have to carry LPG cylinders manually 
due to the non-connectivity by road/lack of road 
infrastructure, and this is one of the reasons for the 
less penetration of LPG in rural areas. It was found 
that LPG is the least preferred fuel in rural houses 
that are not accessible by motorable roads. 
 Use of LPG for applications other than cooking 
was not noticed during the survey. LPG cook 
stoves used in the country vary widely in make 
and quality.
End-use devices efficiencies
Effi ciencies of the end-use devices used as cooking 
appliances vary signifi cantly, as shown in Table 3. 
These impact the amount of fuel used for getting 
similar amount of useful energy.
 As shown in Table 4, useful energy delivered 
using different fuels, after considering the end-use 
device effi ciency, also varies considerably.
 It can be seen that to get the same amount of 
useful energy, 1 kWh of electricity replaces 1.74 kg 
of fuelwood, whereas 1 kg of LPG replaces 14.7 kg 
of fuelwood.
Industrial sector
The development path followed by Bhutan has led 
to a spurt in industrial activities in the past few 
decades. Though the industrial sector in Bhutan has 
many small- and medium-scale industries, energy 
consumption in the industrial sector is dominated 
by few large energy-intensive industries. The 
industrial sector is driven by the fact that Bhutan 
has lowest electricity tariffs in the region, thus, 
making electricity-intensive industries profi table. 
Most industries are located in the southern 
Dzongkhag of Chukha, Samtse, Sarpang, and 
Thimphu, which are closer to the Indian border 
and also to Chukha Hydropower Plant. 
 Three large industries, namely, Bhutan Calcium 
and Carbide Ltd, Penden Cement Authority 
Ltd, and Bhutan Ferro Alloys Ltd, are the major 
consumers of energy in Bhutan. These industries

 The industrial sector consumes 25.5% of 
the total energy and is the largest consumer of 
electricity in the country. In 2005, the sector 
consumed 410 MU of electricity (about 64.7% 
of the total electricity consumed in the country). 
Other fuels that are used in the sector include coal, 
furnace oil, kerosene, LDO, and fuelwood.
 Growth rate of value added in the industry (% 
per year) from 1994 to 2004 is given in Table 5.
 Sectoral share of GDP (% per year) in various 
sectors is given in Table 6.
Transport sector
The transport sector in Bhutan is characterized 
by the dominance of road and air transport. 
Being a hilly country, rivers generally do not run 
very deep, and hence, the use of waterways for 
transport is negligible. In some places, ropeways 
are being used for the transportation of logs and 
other materials. 
Motorization trends in Bhutan
Bhutan has experienced high levels of motorization 
in the recent years. The motor vehicle fl eet has 
more than doubled in the last decade (1997–2007), 
with the number of registered motor vehicles rising 
from 13 584 at the end of 1997 to 30 733 vehicles 
by the end of March 2006. Thus, the number of 
registered motor vehicles has exhibited an average 
annual growth rate of 10.4% during this period.
 Energy consumption in the transport sector 
accounts for 13.7% of the total energy consumption. 
The energy is used in the transport sector for 
mainly road transport, which uses diesel and petrol. 
In 2005, the sector used about 48 703 kilolitres 
of diesel and 13 879 kilolitres of petrol. About 
1145 kilolitres of the aviation turbine fuel was 
consumed during the same period. The country 
is fully dependent on transport fuel imports, and 
the imports are showing a rapid upward trend. The 
import of petrol has gone up more than three times 
over the period 1995–2005, while that of diesel has 
risen 2.5 times during the same period. 
 Besides the rising cost of petrol and diesel, 
complete dependence of the transport sector on 
these imported fuels is an area of concern for 
future, from the energy security perspective.
Commercial and institutional sector
Energy consumption by the commercial and 
institutional sector, consisting of commercial 
establishments, such as shops and hotels, and 
institutional establishments, such as monasteries, 
government offi ces, schools, hospitals, and so 
on, accounts for 10.2% of the total energy 
consumption. The sector is also an important 
electricity consuming sector, consuming 119 
MU in 2005, which is about 18.75% of the total 
electricity consumption in the country. Besides 
electricity, fuelwood, along with LPG and kerosene, 
is also widely used.

Energy use in the agriculture sector
The agriculture sector is mainly dependent on 
human and animal power. However, with recent 
developments, the sector is increasingly using 
state-of-the-art energy resources. 
 Electricity in the agriculture sector is mainly 
used for pumping. The sector consumed about 0.8 
MU of electricity in 2005, which is about 0.13% of 
the total electricity consumption of the country in 
2005. Other fuels used in the sector include diesel 
(about 544 kilolitres) for power tillers, which are 
multipurpose devices for farmers. Subsidized power 
tillers are supplied by the Ministry of Agriculture. 
However, power tillers are predominantly used in 
few Dzongkhags only (Table 7). 
 Cardamom drying, oil extraction, and rice milling 
are some of the other activities that use energy 
resources for post-harvest processing. Overall, 
commercial and modern energy resources do not 
fi nd much use in the agriculture sector compared 
to other sectors. Their use is likely to remain low in 
future too, as agriculture is constrained by natural 
factors such as mountainous terrain. With only 7% 
of the land under cultivation and rising demand 
for land for other uses such as industries and urban 
settlements, agriculture is likely to continue to be 
at the same level as today.
Energy situation in Bhutan in the regional 
context
The per capita energy and electricity supply 
are still way below the world average (Table 8). 
However, in a regional context, Bhutan emerges as 
the leading country in South Asia, both in terms 
of total primary energy supply as well as electricity 
supply per capita per year.
SUMMARY OF MA JOR ISSUES FOR INTEGRATED 
ENERGY PLANNING
Heavy dependence of the residential sector on 
fuelwood would be a cause of concern in the 
years to come. Experience shows that because of 
electrifi cation, fuelwood consumption reduces 
by about 30%–35%.

Agriculture sector
Traditionally, Bhutanese agriculture comprised 
subsistence farming, and rural households were 
self-suffi cient in food production. Bhutan’s 
agricultural sector, which employs about 79% 
of the population but has only about 7% of the 
land under cultivation, is driven substantially by 
the non-commercial energy in the form of human 
labour and animal power. 
 Agriculture activities are constrained in the 
region, which is mostly mountainous. Because 
of the mountainous terrain, it is diffi cult to 
have large farmlands and mechanized farming. 
Besides, large tracts of land are under forests and 
reserved parks. Lack of access to market, absence 
of approach roads from farms to marketplace, 
and lack of storage and post-harvest processing 
facilities are also some of the constraints faced 
by the agriculture sector. Recent years have seen 
improvement in these facilities, and agriculture is 
slowly shifting towards growing horticulture crops 
and cultivating cash crops like potato, rice, and 
so on. Cold storage facilities have been created 
at Paro (close to airport) and Phuentsholing 
for storing apples and oranges before exporting Dzongkhag Tractor Power

The commercial sector is showing substantial 
growth potential and is the third largest 
consumer of energy.
The agriculture sector consumes relatively less

Energy is one of the major drivers of economic 
growth. Bhutan, one of the smallest economies 
based on agriculture and forestry, is expected to 
experience rapid economic growth and development 
in future, and the country’s requirements for energy 
and supporting infrastructure would increase as 
well. In view of this, an integrated assessment 
of energy demand was carried out, along with 
determining the possible energy pathways and 
their impacts on infrastructure requirements.
DEMAND ANALYSIS USING LEAP
The energy demand projections have been carried 
out for a period up to 2020 for the residential, 
industrial, commercial and institutional, and 
transport sectors. The Long-range Energy 
Alternatives Planning model, or LEAP, is a 
scenario-based energy–environment modelling 
tool. Its scenarios are based on comprehensive 
accounting of how energy is consumed, converted, 
and produced in a given region or economy under 
a range of alternative assumptions on population, 
economic development, technology, and price, 
among other factors. LEAP is useful in projecting 
energy supply and demand situations in order to 
provide a glimpse of future patterns, identifying 
potential problems, and assessing the likely impacts 
of energy policies. LEAP can assist in examining a 
wide variety of projects, programmes, technologies, 
and other energy initiatives, and arriving at 
strategies that best address environmental and 
energy problems. The main advantages of LEAP 
are its fl exibility and ease-of-use, which allow 
decision-makers to move rapidly from policy ideas 
Energy scenarios for Bhutan 2020
to policy analysis, without having to resort to more 
complex models. 
 LEAP model projections have been made under 
four different scenarios for electricity, biomass, 
coal, liquefi ed petroleum gas (LPG), petrol, diesel, 
kerosene, and aviation turbine fuel (ATF).
DEFINING SCENARIOS
Energy scenarios are frameworks for analysing 
future energy perspectives, including various 
combinations of technology options and 
interventions. Scenarios help to visualize how 
the future is going to unfold under different 
assumptions. They are particularly helpful in 
investigating alternative future developments and 
their implications. Scenarios can be based on 
assumptions that are compatible with sustainable 
development goals like improved effi ciencies, 
adoption of advanced energy supply technologies 
with low environmental impacts, and effi cient use 
of natural resources. To have a look at the relative 
position of an economy, scenarios can also be 
based on different economic growth trajectories. 
 In the context of building scenarios for projecting 
energy demand for Bhutan, the following four 
scenarios have been considered.
Business-as-usual scenario, or BAU
Energy-effi cient scenario, or EE
High growth scenario, or HIG
High growth coupled with energy effi ciency, or 
HIGEE
The subsequent sections briefl y defi ne the broad 
characteristics of the four scenarios. Detailed 
explanation of the assumptions for different sectors 
is outlined in the later part of the analysis.
#
#
#
#intervention, this scenario is termed as the 
most likely path of development. This scenario 
incorporates existing government plans and policies. 
In the BAU scenario, an average real gross domestic 
product (GDP) growth rate of 7.7% (uniform over 
the entire modelling frame, that is, between 2005 
and 2020) has been considered. Sectoral variables 
grow with historical trends, and the specifi c energy 
consumption of different sectoral activities remains 
at its current levels (2005).
Energy-efficient scenario
This scenario takes into account the specifi c 
energy effi ciency measures spanning across 
all sectors. These measures are expected to be 
adopted uniformly across all sectors from 2008/09. 
Effi ciency improvements in existing devices and 
shifts to modern effi cient technologies are the basic 
characteristics of this scenario. The sectoral variables 
are assumed to grow as per the BAU rates.
High growth scenario
This scenario assumes a high GDP growth 
rate of 10% (uniform over the modelling time 
frame, 2005–20) compared to the GDP growth 
rate of 7.7% assumed in the BAU scenario. The 
HIG scenario is characterized by a shift of the 
economy towards the growth led by the industrial 
and service sector, with the latter dominating in 
terms of its contribution to GDP. Specifi c energy 
consumption fi gures for different sectors remain 
at the BAU levels, wherein the total energy 
consumption for different fuels under different 
sectors is much higher due to higher growth of 
the sectoral variables. 
High growth coupled with energy efficiency 
scenario
Finally, the HIGEE scenario combines a high 
GDP growth rate of 10% with high energy 
effi ciency measures. This scenario is representative 
of the most optimistic scenario in terms of both 
economic growth and technological interventions, 
steering the economy towards the most energyeffi cient path.
The energy demand projections for the residential 
sector under different scenarios have been made 
for urban and rural households that use four 
different categories of fuel: (1) electricity, (2) 
LPG, (3) fuelwood, and (4) kerosene. 
 While Bhutan is aiming at 100% rural 
electrifi cation by 2013, till electricity extends to 
all rural areas, lighting, cooking, and heating will 
continue to be primarily dependent on fuelwood. 
The distribution of households by fuel type is 
presented in Table 1.

The pattern of using fuels is not same in rural 
and urban areas. Urban households depend less 
on kerosene and fuelwood due to relatively high 
usage of electricity and LPG. In rural areas, a 
considerable proportion of the households still 
depends on traditional fuels due to non/less 
availability of modern cleaner fuels.
 The total consumption of these fuels, by and 
large, depends on the growth rate of the sectoral 
variables, the intensity of their use, the future 
penetration rate of devices/modern fuels, and 
their usage pattern among different categories of 
households. Table 2 gives the assumptions under sector is confi ned to regular households only, 
although the census divides the households 
into regular, institutional, and transient. This is 
due to the fact that the household break-up by 
activities and fuel type is available only for regular 
households. According to Population and Housing 
Census of Bhutan 2005, a total of 126 115 regular 
households have been recorded in Bhutan. They 
account for 91% of the total resident population 
(634 982) and 86.3% of the total population 
(resident plus fl oating) of Bhutan. The average 
weighted household size is estimated to be 4.6. 
One year before the census, the natural growth 
rate of population was found to be 1.3%. This 
data is assumed to remain constant over the 
modelling time frame under all scenarios. The 
is assumed to take place uniformly across all the 
scenarios, according to the plans laid down in the 
Rural Electrifi cation Master Plan (REMP); urban 
and rural electrifi cation is expected to reach the 
100% level by the end of the Tenth Five-year Plan 
(the current target is also to achieve 100% rural 
electrifi cation by the end of the Tenth Five-year 
Plan). As far as the distribution of households in 
rural and urban areas is concerned, Census 2005 
reports that 30.4% of the total population lives in 
urban areas and the rest 69.6% lives in rural areas. 
Given the historical trend of urban migration 
(prior to 2000), Vision 2020 predicts that urban 
population will equal rural population by the end 
of 2020, which also holds true for the BAU and 
EE scenarios. However, in the other two scenarios

 The pattern and type of fuel usage are not 
uniform across different categories of households 
and are found to vary signifi cantly. The usage is 
largely governed by the availability and paying 
capacities of the households. With economic growth 
and access to cleaner fuels, the usage pattern 
is assumed to change signifi cantly, especially in 
the HIG scenario. Table 3 shows how the usage 
pattern is expected to change across households 
and scenarios.
 With complete electrifi cation envisaged for rural 
and urban areas by 2013, almost all the households 
will be using electricity. According to TERI survey, 
electricity in urban areas is used for lighting, 
cooking, space heating, washing, refrigeration, 
and for other infotainment devices like TV and 
radio. On the other hand, in rural households, 
the usage is confi ned to lighting, cooking, and for 
running television and radios. The usages of these 
devices across economies by the rural and urban 
households have been obtained from the Bhutan 
Census Report. 
 Improvement in road conditions, increased per 
capita income, and the need to switch to cleaner 
assumed that by 2020, penetration would reach a 
maximum of 88.5%, based on a simple average of 
the existing and the HIG percentages. Kerosene 
consumption in the HIG and HIGEE scenarios is 
assumed to come down to 0% because of faster 
switching to cleaner fuels, with 4.65% being the 
‘end-of-model’ period value under the BAU and 
EE scenarios (simple average). As evident from 
Table 3, fuelwood is being used by 10% of the 
urban households. With access to modern fuels, 
this dependence is assumed to come down to 5% 
by 2020 under the BAU and EE scenarios and to 
1% in the extreme scenarios.
 Fuelwood and kerosene, which at present 
are consumed by more than 50% of the regular 
households, are later to be replaced by electricity 
and LPG. Kerosene usage will experience a steep 
fall in the HIG scenario, where the percentage 
usage will come down to 10% by 2020 as against 
51% in 2005. Fuelwood usage will drop to 30% in 
the HIG scenario as against 40% in the BAU and 
EE scenarios. The use of LPG, which is at present 
used by only 20.3% of the households, is assumed 
to reach 35% in the BAU and EE scenarios and 
50% in the HIG and HIGEE scenarios. The energy

largest amongst all sectoral shares. The relatively 
high energy consumption is on account of the while that for LPG and kerosene, it was close to 
2.5% and 1.5%, respectively. The demand for 
different types of fuels under four scenarios is 
given in Figures 1–4. The focus of the proposed 
sustainable development strategy would be on 
reducing fuelwood share in the residential sector. 
This can be achieved by the (1) introduction of 
high effi ciency cook stoves and (2) switching to 
modern fuels like LPG, electricity, and renewable 
energy like solar cooking, biogas-based cooking, 
and home heating systems.

sector was 80.2 million kWh and is expected to 
reach 175 million kWh by 2020, under the BAU 
scenario, whereas in the HIG scenario, the demand 
can be as high as 253 million kWh. Energy-saving 
measures can help reduce electricity consumption 
by 27%.
Fuelwood 
The present demand for fuelwood is 490 000 
tonnes, which is highly skewed towards rural 
households that account for 95% of the total 
residential usage. Fuel switching is expected, and 
as a result, fuelwood usage will come down to 
294 000 tonnes in the BAU scenario.
FIGURE 1 ELECTRICITY DEMAND
FIGURE 3 LPG DEMAND
FIGURE 4 KEROSENE DEMAND
 In the HIG scenario, due to the faster switching 
to cleaner fuels like LPG and electricity, the 
consumption could come down to 150 000 
tonnes. Demand side management, particularly in 
household cooking, can help achieve an effi ciency 
level of 30%.

 In the HIG scenario, consumption could reach 
9000 tonnes. Achievable effi ciency improvement is 
5%, as the devices in use do not have a scope for 
improvement, which can lead to the reduction in 
the consumption, with the fi gures in the EE and 
HIGEE scenarios being 6200 and 8800 tonnes, 
respectively. 
Kerosene
Kerosene consumption is dominant in rural 
households vis-à-vis urban households, with the 
total kerosene consumption in 2005 being 6400 
kilolitres. 
 With rural electrifi cation, kerosene consumption 
is expected to come down to 3890 kiloliters in the 
BAU and EE scenarios and to 640 kilolitres in the 
HIG and HIGEE scenarios. 
Industrial sector
Till 1998, the industrial sector in Bhutan 
played a limited role in the country’s economic 
development. The sectoral (secondary sector) 
GDP to country’s total GDP was close to 30% 
(between 1990 and 1998). Thereafter, the sectoral 
contribution improved, and between 1999 and 
2002, the sectoral share increased from 36.5% 
to 38%. However, after 2002, it experienced a 
declining trend, reaching as low as 35% in 2004. 
 In Bhutan, industries are broadly classifi ed under 
three categories: (1) private, (2) joint ventures, and 
(3) public. The number of private sector units has 
grown considerably between 2000 and 2004. From 
5678 in 1999, the private sector units increased to 
15 489 by 2004. The joint and public sectors did 
not experience much of a change in the number 
of establishments during the said period. Joint 
sectors increased from 5 to 15 units, with closing 
down of some of the existing ones, while the public 
sector grew marginally at 17 units between 1999 
and 2004. Table 5 shows the trend in the number 
of industries under the three categories.
57% in two years. Notably, the large-scale industries 
grew from 47 in 2004 to 72 in 2006. Substantial 
growth can be noticed in small-scale industries, 
which ranged from 628 in 2004 to 1660 in 2006, 
logging more than 160% growth in two years.

Within the industrial sector, the manufacturing and 
mining industries play a crucial role in determining 
the present and future energy demand. According to 
the MoEA (Ministry of Economic Affairs) estimates 
for 2004, a total of 874 units existed under the 
mining and manufacturing industries, of which 858 
were completely under the private sector. The rest 
16 were under joint and public sector undertakings.

the energy projection for the sector is concerned, 
analysis has been done separately for both energyintensive and non-energy-intensive industries.
 Given the above complexities, the criterion 
used to identify energy-intensive industries is 
the share of fuel cost to total cost of production. 
Based on the fi gures published in the Census of 
Manufacturing Industries 2001, the average share 
of energy expenditure to total was estimated at 
the sectoral level. The relative position of the 
industries (whether energy intensive or not) is 
classifi ed based on the fact whether the share of 
the cost of fuel to total cost of production exceeds 
the economy’s average. Data related to fuel and 
total costs was not available for the iron and steel 
plant. As a result, the data for the same has been 
assumed to be similar to that of the Indian industry 
for 2000. The value obtained for the industry was 
found to be 0.17, which is above the average value 
calculated for Bhutan (0.055). Table 7 shows the 
list of industries, which can be categorized as 
energy intensive.

Categorization of industries for energy 
projections
In Bhutan, the Bhutan Power Corporation (BPC) 
categorizes electricity consumers under the three 
following heads.
1 Low voltage consumers (230 volts and 
415 volts)
2 Medium voltage consumers (6.6 kV, 11 kV, 
and 33 kV)
3 High voltage consumers (66 kV and above)
The low voltage consumers are mostly from the 
residential and commercial sectors and a number 
of small-scale industries. Medium-scale and some 
small-scale industries come under the medium 
voltage category. Finally, heavy, power-intensive 
industries come under the high voltage category. 
As per the records of the BPC (2005), altogether 
there are three high voltage industries, which 
consume 56% of the total electricity, followed 1 Bhutan Ferro Alloys Ltd, or BFAL
2 Bhutan Calcium Carbide Ltd, or BCCL
3 Penden Cement Authority Ltd, or PCAL
4 Druk Cement Company Ltd, or DCCL
5 Druk Iron and Steel Ltd, or DISL
6 Bhutan Steels Ltd, or BSL
The rest are classifi ed under the category of nonenergy-intensive industries. These industries are 
further classifi ed as: (1) existing and (2) upcoming 
units. In the following sections, the existing 
energy consumption patterns (energy intensities), 
technologies used in energy-intensive units, and 
Energy-intensive industries
Of the six industries listed above, the fi rst three are 
listed under the high voltage category consumers, 
while the rest are under the medium voltage 
category. In 2005, these six industries consumed 
electricity equivalent to 377 million kWh (close to 
90% of the total sectoral electricity consumption 
of 420 million kWh and 62% of the country’s 
electricity consumption of 615 million kWh). 
 The energy-intensive industries indicated above 
are export oriented, with India as their major 
international market. The geographical pattern 
of the sales of four energy-intensive industries is 
presented in Table 8.

likely to taper off in the coming years with the 
completion of the Tala Hydel Power Project. This 
can, to some extent, affect the business of the plant, 
and if no substantial demand is generated, the 
plant has to depend on the market of neighbouring 
countries, especially Nepal, Bangladesh, and India. 
Notwithstanding increasing liberalization of these 
economies, there is a possibility of having to cope 
with greater competition. For example, there were 
concerns that calcium carbide exports from China 
were driving down the price of calcium carbide in 
India, thereby posing a threat to Bhutan’s calcium 
carbide exports. This implies that the cement and 
other industries have to improve their production 
effi ciency to remain competitive internationally. 
 According to the list provided by the BPC, a total 
of 55 industries (Annexure 3.2) have been given 
license to operate in Bhutan and are expected to 
ingots, and one each is categorized under cement 
and magnesium metal. The production capacities 
of the existing energy-intensive industries and the 
upcoming ones are indicated in Table 9.
 These industries mostly consume electricity as 
fuel in production. Signifi cant coal usage is found 
in cement plants. As far as the consumption of 
petroleum products is concerned, industries are 
found to consume high speed diesel (HSD), 
furnace oil (FO), and light diesel oil (LDO). Of 
the total industrial consumption of HSD (10 120 
kilolitres) in 2004, energy-intensive industries 
consumed 1000 kilolitres, approximately 10% of 
the total industrial usage. A considerable amount 
of FO (93% of the total industrial use) is also 
used. However, the usage of LDO is low compared 
to total industrial usage, which is approximately 
3%. Compared to these fuels, electricity is 
used extensively in these very industries.

Bhutan’s coal import in 2005 was estimated 
at 124 000 tonnes. Cement industry was the 
largest consumer, with consumption close to 58 
000 tonnes. With the expansion in existing plant 
capacities and setting up of new industries, the 
demand is estimated to rise to 586 000 tonnes by 
the end of 2020 (Figure 7).
 Demand side management can help reduce 
total coal consumption by 21%, that is, to 450 000 
tonnes approximately (Figure 7). Coal consumption 
under the HIG and HIGEE scenarios is assumed to 
be same as that under the BAU and EE scenarios, 
since most of the additional proposed industries 
assumed to be established under the HIG scenario 
are not likely to use coal. 
industries existed in Bhutan. Because of the 
unavailability of data for 2005, the annual average 
growth rate (between 2000 and 2004) was used to 
arrive at the 2005 fi gure on the number of nonenergy-intensive industries, the number of which 
was pegged at 980. Under the baseline scenario, 
the total number of industries is expected to reach 
the 3500 mark, on the assumption that the average 
annual growth rate remains at 9%, the annual 
growth rate for these industries between 1990 and 
2004. In the HIG scenario, the number of operating 
industry is expected to reach 6300 by 2020, on the 
assumption that the average annual growth rate 
is 14%, which the industry experienced between 
2000 and 2004. Table 11 presents the assumptions 
for estimating the number of industries and the 
energy intensities (energy consumption per 
establishment) under four different scenarios.
 In addition to normal growth of the existing 
industries, 38 new licenses have also been awarded. 
Majority of these industries are into agro-based 
food products, silk fabric, and marble slabs. 
Approximately, 26 MW power has been allocated, 
and these units are expected to consume 65 million 
kWh per annum. Based on these fi gures, the average 
electricity consumption per unit is calculated to be 
1.7 million kWh. However, with proper effi ciency

Commercial and institutional sector
The commercial and institutional sector has 
been divided into four sub-sectors. These are as 
follows.
1 Tourism 
2 Commercial establishments (complexes, 
including shops and restaurants)
3 Institutions
4 Bulk energy consumers like defence 
In the subsequent sections, each sector, its growth, 
the present and future energy intensities, and the 
energy saving potential are discussed in detail. 
Finally, energy demand for the sector, by fuel, is 
presented.
Tourism
Tourism can have a substantial impact on 
Bhutan’s economic sector. Furthermore, tourism 
is the second largest foreign currency earner 
and the most important contributor in terms of 
free convertible currency (Strategy Document, 
Department of Tourism, 2005). There has been a 
considerable growth in the infl ow of international 
tourists in the recent past. The total international 
arrival at the end of 1996 was estimated to be 
5137, and by 2006, the total infl ow reached an all 
time high of 17 342. Figure 10 presents the tourist 
infl ow in Bhutan between 1996 and 2005.
 As per the latest records, Bhutan has more than 
175 hotels with more than 4000 beds. Average 
duration of stay per tourist in Bhutan has been 
estimated to be approximately 10 days. As far as 
the consumption of energy by these international 
tourists is concerned, the typical energy basket 
includes electricity, LPG, and petroleum products.

Electricity
The total electricity demand in 2005 was found to 
be 43 million kWh, which is slated to rise sharply 
to 132 million kWh by 2010 and 223 MU by 
2020 under the BAU scenario, while in the HIG 
scenario, the demand will be 346 MU by 2020.
 Energy saving potential for this sector is close to 
10%, which can help reduce consumption by 20 
MU and 34 MU for the EE and HIGEE scenarios, 
respectively.

YearWhile the consumption of electricity and LPG is 
discussed in this section, petroleum consumption 
is dealt with separately in the section on the 
transport sector. 
 Based on a rapid appraisal survey in three hotels 
in Thimphu, the electricity and LPG consumption 
per capita was estimated. Table 12 describes in 
detail the assumptions made in regard to the 
number of tourists expected to visit Bhutan, their 
energy consumption under different scenarios, 
and the saving potential.
 The estimation of the number of tourists 
between 2005 and 2020 under the BAU and EE 
scenarios is based on the annual average infl ux 
of foreign tourists in Bhutan between 1991 
and 2004. The average infl ux rate obtained was 
However, the infl ux rate has changed signifi cantly 
over the past fi ve years. In 2001, the number of 
foreign tourists visiting Bhutan was 6395, which 
increased to 13 626 by 2005, marking an annual 
average growth rate of 21%. Based on this growth 
rate, the fi nal fi gure for 2020 is 237 800. Each 
tourist is estimated to consume about 261 kWh 
of electricity and 6.21 kg of LPG. Use of energyeffi cient lighting and heating can reduce electricity 
consumption by 30%. As a result, the electricity 
intensity (electricity usage per tourist) can come 
down to 183 kWh. As far as LPG consumption 
is concerned, there may not be a far-reaching 
improvement, as even the existing LPG cook stoves 
are highly energy effi cient. However, some research 
studies suggest that effi ciency can be improved 
further by regular cleaning of stoves, using materials 
that have high heat conductivity for cooking, and so 
on. The effi ciency attainable is 5% of the existing 
stoves, thus resulting in the reduction of the per 
capita consumption to 5.8 kg of LPG.
Commercial complexes, including hotels and 
restaurants
With increasing per capita disposable income 
and the government’s policy to promote tourism 
in Bhutan, the commercial sector as a whole has 
experienced a healthy growth rate between 2000 
and 2005, which is pegged at 16%. The growth in 
retail and hotel/restaurant industry is presented in 
Table 13.

The commercial sector contributed about 4% 
to the total GDP in 2000. With sustained high 
growth, the sector’s total contribution has almost 
doubled in a span of fi ve years. The number of 
establishments, too, has grown during the same 
period. As per the records of the BPC, 5431 
establishments existed in 2003. Based on the 
available data, the average growth rate of 7% 
(growth between 2000 and 2005) has been used to 
arrive at the 2005 fi gure, which is pegged at 6090 
(Table 14). Based on this rate, the total number 
of such establishments can reach 16 460 by 2020. 
On the other hand, a high growth rate of 10% can 
raise the number to 24 900.
 The data on the total electricity supplied to the 
commercial sector has been obtained from the 
BPC. The average annual electricity consumption 
was estimated at 3645 kWh. Given the energy 
saving potential of 30% by switching to effi cient 
lighting and space heating, the specifi c electricity 
consumption can come down to 2551 kWh. The 
fi gures pertaining to the consumption of LPG 
kg. Energy intensities under the EE and HIGEE 
scenarios for these two fuels are 1107 kg and 1384 
kg, respectively.
Institutions
Institutions include government buildings, 
monasteries, educational buildings, and hospitals. 
Institutional constructions did not experience a 
major surge between 1999 and 2003. In 1998, 
the total number of institutions (based on BPC 
estimates) was 1578, which reached 2539 by 2003. 
Since fi gures for 2005 were not available, the base 
year number was estimated using the growth rate 
of 12%, which the sub-sector experienced between 
1999 and 2003. For this sub-sector, the growth 
in the number of institutions between 2005 and 
2020 has been kept at 12% for all the scenarios. 
Based on the BPC supply fi gures, the electricity 
consumption per institution was found to be 
8033 kWh per annum. Moreover, energy balance 
fi gures suggest that the wood consumption per 
institution was 20 282 kg per establishment. In 
the EE scenario, the consumption of electricity 
and fi rewood reduces to 5623 kWh and 16 266 
kg, respectively.
Bulk 
The growth in the bulk consumers has also been 
pretty moderate between 1998 and 2003, for which 
fi gures have been made available by the BPC.

 Energy effi ciency can lead to 30% savings, with 
the consumption coming down to 332 million kWh 
and 378 million kWh under the EE and HIGEE 
scenarios, respectively.
LPG
Estimate shows that LPG consumption was 926 
tonnes in 2005, and it is expected to reach 3010 
tonnes and 5000 tonnes under the BAU and HIG 
scenarios, respectively, by 2020.
Fuelwood
Fuelwood consumption is likely to increase from 
140 000 tonnes to 534 000 tonnes and 584 000 
tonnes by 2020, under the BAU and HIG scenarios, 
respectively. 
Transport sector
Bhutan’s transport sector comprises road and 
air transport. According to the Bhutan Statistical 
Yearbook, till June 2005, the total length of roads 
was 4392 km, which served a total land area of 
38 394 km2
 and catered to a total population 
of 672 425 (Bhutan Census 2005). This gives a 
road density of 0.114 km/km2
 and 6.53 km/1000 
inhabitants.

linking different cities/towns and the lack of 
alternative/competing transportation modes have 
made the road-based transportation modes the 
preferred modes for transportation. With the growth 
in the construction sector, transport, storage, and 
communication have contributed signifi cantly to 
the GDP. In 2000, the share of the sector to total 
GDP was 8.8%, which increased to 10.6% at the

Energy consumption in the transport sector
Diesel, gasoline, and ATF are the main fuels 
consumed in the transport sector. Alternative 
fuels like compressed natural gas (CNG) and LPG 
are not used for transportation in Bhutan. The 
economy meets its entire energy demand through 
imports from India. Figure 17 gives the trends in 
the quantity of imported fuels consumed in the

 Of the three major transportation fuels imported 
in Bhutan, diesel has the largest share—in 2005, it 
was close to 78% (51 440 kilolitres), followed by 
petrol at 20% (13 755 kilolitres) and ATF close to 
2% (1200 kilolitres). The average annual growth 
rate of the demand for petrol has been greater 
than that of diesel. Between 1996 and 2005, the 
annual growth rate of petrol was 15.3% and that of 
diesel, 12%. The sustained growth in demand for 
diesel has been because of the construction sector. 
Construction of three major hydel power projects, 
that is, Kurichu, Basochhu, and Tala, between 
1996 and 2005, has contributed to the increased 
diesel consumption (increased transportation of 
materials) in a major way. Again, the growing 
economy, with increased per capita income and 
stable infl ation, has led to the growth in private 
transport vehicles, thus leading to increased 
petrol consumption. As far as the ATF import is 
concerned, till 2004, the demand grew at a very 
low rate. Increase in international tourists, coupled 
with the opening of new routes, has led to a sudden 
spurt in the demand for ATF. The growth rate for 
2005 was 7.5% as against an average of 6.8%. Demand projections for different categories of 
transport fuels (diesel, petrol, and ATF) have been 
made based on the bivariate regression analysis of 
fuel imports and GDP. The regression forms used 
are as follows.
Diesel import (litres) = α1 + β1GDPconstant 
2000 (Ngultrum) + e1
Petrol import (litres) = α2 + β2GDPconstant 
2000 (Ngultrum) + e2
ATF import (litres) = α3 + β3GDPconstant 
2000 (Ngultrum) + e3
where e1, e2, and e3 are the random error 
components of the above regression equations. 
Based on the least square method, some parameters 
were estimated, which are presented in Table 16.
 It is observed from Table 16 that when the GDP 
increases by Nu 1 million, the consumption of diesel, 
petrol, and ATF increases by 2.49, 0.711, and 0.043 
kilolitres, respectively. Using this estimate, the future 
demand for these petroleum products is estimated 
based on the assumption that the average annual 
real GDP growth rate is 7.3%, the average growth 
rate obtained from 2000–05 estimate (National 
Statistics Bureau 2005). In the HIG scenario, the 
average growth rate considered is 10%, which the 
economy achieved in 2002 (9.99%). Based on recent 
research, there is a signifi cant scope for improving 
fuel effi ciencies, especially for the vehicles running 
on petrol and diesel. As far as the vehicle category

The role of energy is crucial for any country that 
is traversing the rapid development path. It is an 
established fact that with the provision of energy, 
the quality of life improves considerably—education 
standards improve, along with health and hygiene, 
particularly that of women and children who 
otherwise spend considerable time in collecting 
fuels. An Asian Development Bank (ADB) study 
(2003) revealed that increased access to electricity 
raised the incomes of the Bhutanese people, 
lessened the extent of health burden, and positively 
contributed to improved education levels.
 The Royal Government of Bhutan (RGoB) 
recognizes the importance of energy and has 
been taking several measures to accomplish its 
ambitious goal of ‘electricity for all by 2020’, now 
revised to 2013 with the Druk Phuensum Tshogpa 
(DPT) Government in power. Bhutan is endowed 
with rich water resources, along with abundant 
biomass reserves, both being key energy sources 
for fulfi lling the country’s energy needs. Both 
these resources are being exploited in a sustainable 
manner to fulfi l the energy needs of the people. The 
government has formulated Rural Electrifi cation 
Master Plan (REMP) 2005, which provides a road 
map to achieve 100% electrifi cation in the country 
within the stipulated time frame.
 As explained earlier, the energy needs of the 
Bhutanese economy can be categorized in the 
following manner. 
Resources for electricity generation
Fuels and resources for the transport sector, 
which is currently completely dependent on 
fossil fuels (petrol and diesel)

Energy supply options for Bhutan
Fuels to meet heat and mechanical energy 
demand of the industrial, commercial, and 
residential sectors (excluding electricity) 
This chapter covers the supply side options to meet 
the demand, including various renewable energy 
options for sustainable supply of energy.
THE POLIC Y AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR 
THE POWER SECTOR
The policy for the power sector is in the draft stage; 
however, the policy and planning of the power 
sector in Bhutan have two major objectives.
1 Emphasis on power exports to strengthen the 
 economy
2 Supply of reliable, environment-friendly, and 
 affordable power for all citizens
The overall policy and regulatory interventions 
are guided by these two broad objectives. The 
accelerated hydropower development has been 
identifi ed as an option for achieving these objectives. 
The Ninth and the Tenth Five-year Plans indicate 
the policy direction for this sector.
 To ensure reliable and affordable supply of 
electricity, the policy measures include allocating 
15% of annual energy generated from all large 
hydropower plants for domestic consumption at a 
nominal rate of 0.3 Nu/unit. This is applicable for 
the power plants owned by the government or its 
entities. 
 For the supply of safe and reliable power, the 
Bhutan Electricity Authority (BEA) has put in 
process a transparent methodology for determining 
tariffs for power generation and consumption for 
different user categories. The policy is working 
#sector, the power would be supplied at subsidized 
rates as a social obligation so as to ensure socioeconomic development.
 Given dispersed population and the complex 
terrain, the electricity supply to all would require 
major fi nancial resources for grid extension.
 Thus, the critical policy issues in the power 
sector are (1) accelerating development of the 
hydropower sector by attracting investments and 
assuring reliable supply, considering the seasonal 
variations in supply; and (2) extending the grid to 
supply affordable power to all, without affecting 
economic viability in the power sector.
 A range of options to address 
these issues is as follows.
Accelerated development of 
large hydropower plants
Development of medium 
hydropower plants in 
independent power producer 
(IPP) mode
Promotion of medium 
hydropower plants for captive 
use in industries
Enhancement of power capacity 
of a fi rm by diversifying the 
electricity supply options, mainly through 
renewable energy sources (other than 
hydropower).
These would be dealt with in detail subsequently.
POWER SECTOR DEVELOPMENT
The power sector in Bhutan is synonymous with 
the hydropower sector, with more than 99% of 
electricity being generated by the hydropower 
sector. The hydropower sector has been the main 
driver of the Bhutanese economy, and through

the commissioning of Tala Hydropower Plant in 
2007, but it is still about 40% because of the rapid 
growth in other sectors. 
 The hydropower potential of the technoeconomically feasible sites is estimated to be about 
23 760 MW, of which thus far only 1.6% has been 
developed (Table 1). With the commissioning of 
Tala Hydropower Project (1020 MW), the total 
installed capacity has risen to 1488 MW, and 
the mean annual generation is now about 7412

 While the hydropower sector is the propeller of 
the Bhutan’s economy, to ensure that hydropower 
development does not take place in a haphazard 
manner but proceeds on the basis of careful 
identifi cation of most promising sites, the RGoB 
updated the Power System Master Plan (PSMP) 
of 1993 for the period 1990–2010 to cover 
partially the period 2003–22 in its Water Resource 
Management Plan (WRMP) 2004. The WRMP 
2004 screened hydropower projects on the basis 
of technical and economic criteria to select most 
promising projects, which were then subjected to 
Multiple Criteria Analysis (MCA)1
 for the eventual 
adoption in the WRMP.

 MCA facilitates comparison of projects that may have different types of impacts of highly varying magnitude. The variables are
grouped under four key criteria, representing important objectives of the Government of Bhutan: technical, economic, social, and 
environmental.estimated that if 25 of the 78 sites were developed, 
the installed capacity would be around 16 435 
MW. Based on the screening of the projects, six 
potential projects were selected for implementation 
during the Power Master Plan period of 2003–22.

 While there exists considerable hydropower 
potential in Bhutan, there are several constraints 
in fully exploiting this potential, encompassing 
technical, fi nancial, environmental, and market 
limitations. One unique characteristic of the 
Bhutanese power sector is its complete dependence 
on hydropower and run-of-the-river type plants. 
Also, there is an issue of energy security due to 
overdependence on hydropower.
 The run-of-the-river-type plants are 
environmentally benign and have lower cost of 
power generation compared to the other renewable 
energy resources; however, this has rendered the 
development of power plants in any other sector 
– renewable or conventional – commercially 
unviable and unattractive. 
potential in a sustainable manner, with the 
existing plants being run-of-the-river schemes as 
opposed to storage-based plants. While the runof-the-river schemes ensure relatively benign use 
of environmental resources, the biggest challenge 
posed by them is their inability to operate at full 
capacity in the lean season when the river fl ow 
remains low. This is particularly true in winter 
months when the demand is at the peak without 
secure sources of energy supply. 
 With the commissioning of Tala Hydropower 
Plant, 288 MW of fi rm power (power available 
in the lean season) is available. Currently, the 
peak demand is about 211 MW, and as per the 
demand projections, it would rise to about 500 
MW in near future (2012), if all the sanctioned 
industries become operational. The Department 
of Energy (DoE) plans to tackle this shortage in 
the following ways. 
Licenses to new ferro alloy industries will be 
given only after taking a long-term and holistic 
view of (1) the peak power demand in the 
country and (2) fi rm power availability.
In case of shortage of power, priority will 
be given to the residential and institutional 
sectors. 
The Bhutan Power Corporation will regulate 
the allotment of power to industries.
Power plant output will be augmented using 
better water management techniques to boost 
production during peak hours. 
Effi cient management of hydropower plants will 
be undertaken.
Financing of hydropower projects
The issue of raising capital to invest in the 
additional power generation is a big challenge 
for Bhutan, which does not have an international 
credit rating. As seen in Table 2, for the six potential 
power plants, determined by the WRMP (2004), 
an investment of about $3660 million is required, 
which translates into capital expenditure of $183 
million per year. 
 Mobilization of the resources of this magnitude, 
however, remains a critical issue, given the limited

# Though the Government of India has been 
expressing interest in fi nancing the hydropower 
sector in Bhutan and has also committed to 
purchase extra power, the question is to what 
extent can Bhutan expect such fi nancing options 
from India (Table 3). According to the WRMP, 
a number of factors would eventually determine 
the availability of international fi nancing for 
hydropower development in Bhutan. The major 
challenge for hydropower funding is devising 
packages with debt servicing and maturities. Often, 
the potential imbalance between revenue and debt 
service, along with the level of risk involved in the 
project, prevents investors from fi nancing large 
hydropower projects.
 The most important factor with respect to the 
above is the size of the schemes—given the large 
size of hydropower schemes, fi nancing is diffi cult. 
It is suggested that to overcome this problem, a 
public–private model, together with the backing 
of an international lending agency, could be 
considered. Besides the size, securing fi nance 
rests on the prospects of achieving a return on 
the capital, which should be suffi cient to cover the 
level of risk involved. One such type of model that 
can be considered is the build, operate, own, and 
transfer (BOOT) model, which could be backed 
by the international lending agencies (Box 1).
that plants of small or medium capacities, typically 
about 100 MW capacity each, are planned and 
established. These plants should be promoted in 
eastern Dzongkhags, which are underdeveloped 
and where power outages are very common.
 To accelerate the development of the hydropower 
sector in Bhutan, Hydropower Policy, 2008, has 
been fi nalized, although it is yet to be notifi ed. 
Besides, a holding company called the Druk Green 
Power Corporation (DGPC) has been established 
to allow for optimal utilization of resources and 
enhance capacity building. It would also serve 
as an investment arm of the government, which 
would invest in future hydropower projects.
 For an accelerated development of the 
hydropower sector, case studies have been evaluated 
to assess various proposed/feasible power plants 
under different fi nancing options under IPP and 
captive power plant mode. These case studies are 
discussed in subsequent sections.
Development of large hydropower plants 
Till now, the development of large power plants in 
Bhutan was fi nanced through a mix of loans and 
grants. For accelerated development, other means 
of developing large hydropower plants would be 
required. Hydropower plants on IPP mode can 
also be developed with the help of public and

Indiaprivate partnerships or foreign direct investment 
(FDI). The private investment as well as FDI 
would depend on the viability of the projects as 
well as policies and regulations in the power sector. 
The viability of these plants will, in turn, depend 
on their cost of generation. A fi nancial analysis to 
estimate the generation cost for such power plant 
was carried out using lifecycle cost approach, as 
explained subsequently. Since the revenue of these 
IPP would be in Ngultrum or in Indian rupees, an 
arrangement could be worked out for the import 
of the required equipment from India.
 Large hydropower projects are developed 
primarily for exporting power to India, with 
certain percentage of power reserved for domestic 
consumption.
Case study I: Cost–benefit analysis for 
Chamkarchu Power Plant as independent 
power producer
An analysis was carried out for the Chamkarchu 
Hydropower Plant, one of the seven identifi ed 
hydropower plants in the master plan, to check the 
fi nancial viability of large power plants as IPP with 
the present policy. The analysis is summarized as 
follows. 
A build, own, operate, and transfer, or BOOT, model is a funding model that involves a single organization or 
period of time and then transferring this ownership across to an agreed party. The BOOT schemes are increasingly 
becoming a popular means of fi nancing large-scale infrastructure development such as roads, bridges, and 
hydro dams in Australia and developing countries. An example in this respect is the 210 MW Theun-Hinboun 
Hydropower Project in Lao PDR, which developed in joint venture between the Government of Laos (GoL) and 
the private sector. The Laos government’s state-owned electricity utility, Electricité du Laos (EdL), owns 60% 
of the project and the investment in the project is largely fi nanced by a loan of $60 million from the Asian 
Development Bank (ADB). The ownership of the remaining 40% share of the project is split equally between the 
Thai company MDX Lao and Nordic Hydropower, a partnership organization owned by the Swedish government 
public utility. The total cost of the project is $240 million. It is being fi nanced and developed as a BOOT venture 
that would see the project transferred back to the government in 30 years. The Theun-Hinboun Power Company, 
or THPC, is running this joint venture project.

15% generation for domestic consumption at Nu 
0.3/kWh and export of rest of power at Nu 2.0/kWh 
shows that the generation is fi nancially viable, with 
return on equity more than 15%. Thus, the present 
policy of promoting large hydropower plants that 
export power and also provide power for domestic 
consumption at subsidized rate can be continued. 
If there are major changes in the fi nancing terms, 
then the strategy may have to be reworked, that is, 
the rate at which power is sold for domestic use 
would have to be adjusted to make the projects 
viable. The analysis carried out was on completely 
commercial basis, that is, without any grant. With 
economic viability of the large hydropower plants, 
that is, they continue exporting power to India, these 
power plants can also be developed on IPP or FDI 
mode. Another option is developing these plants 
on BOOT mode. As explained earlier, equipment 
imports could be facilitated from India to take care 
of hard currency issue.
Development of medium-capacity hydropower 
plants
In addition to large-capacity plants, there exists 
large potential for medium-capacity (up to 100 
MW) hydropower plants. The Power Systems 
Master Plan has identifi ed about 36 plants of 
capacity up to 100 MW, as shown in Table 4.
 An analysis of the small- and medium-sized 
hydropower plants was carried out to examine the 
viability of promoting such plants in IPP mode 
with private sector investments and as captive 
hydropower plant for energy-intensive industries.
Case study II: Medium-sized hydropower plant 
development as independent power producer
This analysis is based on typical design parameters 
for the feasible sites and costs, which are estimated 
based on Indian experience for similar capacity 
plants in similar Himalayan region. 
 The detailed calculations are given in

The cost of generation, estimated as per the BEA 
methodology for tariff estimation, for mediumcapacity hydropower power projects works out to 
be about Nu 1.68/kWh, since the capital as well 
as operation and maintenance (O&M) costs per 
megawatt of installed capacity for these plants are 
higher than the large hydropower plants. With the 
present domestic tariff, it will not be viable for the 
IPP to sell 15% power for domestic use at Nu 0.3/
kWh. In that case, the sale price for the rest 85% 
becomes higher than the export price to get 14% 
return on equity. The IPPs can sell up to 10% of 
power at 0.3 Nu/kWh for domestic consumption 
and sell/export the rest of power at export rate to 
get 14% return on equity. 
 Thus, the IPPs would be viable with this model, 
that is, domestic sale of 10% generation at Nu 
0.3/kWh and rest exported/sold at export price. 
 This analysis assumes 9% interest rate. Any 
upward change in the interest rate would affect 
the viability of the medium-capacity power plants. 
For example, the analysis with 12% interest rate 
shows that the generation cost reaches about Nu 
1.86. With this generation cost, it would not be 
viable for the IPP to sell any power at subsidized 
rate of Nu 0.3 /kWh. 
with private investment (domestic or foreign), 
since the total investments (about Nu 60 million 
per MW) are not very large, and the private sector 
can look at the option of establishing such plant. 
Case study III: Development of mediumcapacity hydropower plants in captive mode
The medium-capacity hydropower plants could 
also be used for captive generation by industries. 
Private sector companies interested in setting up 
energy-intensive industry would look at these 
medium-sized plants as captive power generation 
units to ensure enough power supply round the 
year. This scenario was analysed for mediumcapacity hydropower plants. The assumptions are 
same as in the case of the analysis of mediumcapacity power plants. The analysis shows that the 
cost of generation is higher for medium-capacity 
hydropower plants in full commercial mode, that is, 
without any capital grants. The cost of generation 
is about Nu 1.88/kWh, which is higher than the 
present tariff paid by the industry. Thus, it would 
not be viable for industries to invest in mediumcapacity hydropower plants for captive generation. 
However, as the cost of generation is lower than 
the export price, the medium-capacity hydropower 
plants should be promoted as captive power plants 
by providing capital grant or subsidy. The capital 
subsidy would make the generation cost comparable 
to the present high voltage tariff. In such a scenario, 
if the industries invest in captive generation, then 
equivalent power would be available for exports. 
A sensitivity analysis shows that the capital grant 
of 40% of project cost brings the generation cost 
down to Nu 1.2/kWh, which is the present tariff for 
industry. Thus, with generation costs comparable 
with present high voltage tariff, the industries 
could become interested in setting up captive small 
hydropower units. Further, as the cost of generation 
includes 14% return on equity, making additional 
investment in captive generation by the industry 
is also a viable option. Table 5 shows the cost of 
generation at different levels of subsidy. Detailed 
calculations are given in Annexure 4.1.Capital grant (%) Cost of generation (with 15% 
return on equity) (Nu/kWh)
Rate of return

15 1.60 36
25 1.41 21
35 1.22 15
40 1.17 13
From the government’s perspective, by providing, 
say, 35% grant, the benefi t would be in terms of 
having surplus energy, which could be exported 
at a price of Nu 1.85–2/kWh. Thus, against the 
expenditure of 35% grant, there is additional 
income through higher exports. A conservative 
estimate shows about 40% rate of return through 
export of power against 35% expenditure as 
subsidy for captive plants. Here the assumption 
is that any amount of energy can be exported 
at any point of time at fi xed export rate. This is 
possible since the Government of India has agreed 
to buy power up to 10 000-MW capacity under 
the umbrella agreement. 
Seasonal variation, energy security, and power 
plant development
As all hydropower plants in Bhutan are ‘runof-the-river’ type, the power generation has a 
very high seasonal variation. In winter season, 
hydropower generation drops to almost 20% of 
its installed capacity. Thus, there is a critical issue 
of availability of fi rm power. After commissioning 
of Tala Hydropower Plant, the available fi rm 
power has reached about 253 MW. Based on the 
projected energy demand by the WRMP (2004), 
it must be noted that in case no new hydropower 
plants are developed soon after Tala, the peak 
supply capacity in winter months will fall short 
of projected peak power requirements. In such a 
situation, Bhutan would have to resort to power cuts 
or power imports from India, which would impact 
the country’s export earnings from electricity 
sale. Further, whether India has surplus power to 
the Department of Energy (DoE), is regulating 
the allotment of power to industries. The licensing 
to the industries has been done considering the 
availability of fi rm power. This policy deals with 
the demand side management. On the supply 
side, the options for augmenting power generation, 
more importantly, the fi rm power availability, are 
accelerated development of large as well as small 
hydropower plants. As large power plants have 
longer time of construction, development of smalland medium-capacity hydropower plants may be 
undertaken. The private/foreign participation may 
be encouraged, as discussed in the earlier section. 
Since the run-of-the-river hydropower plants will 
have seasonal variations, there would be limited 
improvement in the availability of fi rm power. The 
options for improving the fi rm power, therefore, 
could include the following.
Development of storage-based hydropower 
plants
Development of power generation from 
renewable energy sources
Case study IV: Development of reservoir 
hydropower plants
Given high hydropower potential, there is a 
possibility of developing 
reservoir-based hydropower 
plant in Bhutan. The DoE 
is considering developing 
the Sankosh Hydropower 
Project in reservoir mode. 
However, the capital 
investment required for 
reservoir hydropower 
plants is higher than the 
run-of-the-river plants, and 
thus, the cost of generation 
is also higher. An analysis 
was carried out to study the 
economic viability of the Sankosh Hydropower 
Plant under present policies and export price. The 
results of the analysis are as follows.

The cost of generation, estimated as per the BEA 
methodology for tariff estimation, for reservoir 
hydropower projects works out to be about 1.56 
Nu/kWh, since the capital and O&M costs are 
higher than those of large hydropower plants. As 
a result, the generation cost is higher. With the 
higher generation cost and the policy of reserving 
15% of generation for domestic consumption at 
0.30 Nu/unit, the storage hydropower plants may 
not be economically viable. To make them viable, 
the limit for the sale of power at Nu 0.3/units may 
have to be reduced. This is desirable, as such power 
plants would provide much needed fi rm power in 
winter months. The analysis is done without any 
grant component; if any grant is made available, 
the generation cost would reduce accordingly. 
 At this stage, it is appropriate to look at the other 
renewable energy options for power generation to 
reduce dependence on hydropower.
Development of pump storage schemes
Pumped storage hydroelectricity is a type of 
hydroelectric power generation used for load 
balancing. In a pumped storage plant, the energy 
is stored in the form of water, pumped from a lower 
elevation reservoir to higher elevation. This is an 
effective way of storing energy during the periods 
 Typically, in a pumped storage plant, 
approximately 75%–85% of the electrical energy 
used to pump water in the elevated reservoir is 
regained. This system can respond very fast to load 
fl uctuations.
 In the context of Bhutan, which generates almost 
all electricity as hydropower, pumped storage 
schemes or storage dam schemes would be ideal 
schemes for grid energy storage. Barring industrial 
loads, the demand for electricity fl uctuates a great 
deal during the 24-hour cycle, and effectively 
designed pumped storage system can help in 
conserving energy.
POWER GENERATION USING RENEWABLE ENERGY 
In Bhutan, renewable and non-conventional energy 
sources like solar, wind, biomass, and municipal 
solid waste can be harnessed for power generation. 
The power generation through these sources would 
provide diversity in the power portfolio, which 
presently consists mainly of the hydro resources. 
The power generation from biomass could be a 
viable option, given high forest cover in Bhutan. 
Sources like sun and wind could also supplement 
power generation. These technologies could also 
be used for decentralized power generation. Given 
the resource availability, the option for generating 
power from biomass in a centralized mode and 
using wind and solar photovoltaics in off-grid mode 
could be explored. Similarly, utilizing municipal 
solid waste for energy generation can also help 
in addressing issues related to viable disposal 
and management of ever-increasing solid waste 
in Bhutan’s urban centres. A detailed analysis of 
renewable energy options for power generation is 
provided in the subsequent sections.
Alternatives to hydropower
It is advisable to enhance the diversity of resources 
for electricity generation, and since the next major 
hydropower plant of the country, Punatsangchu I, 
would be operational only in 2015, it is essential to 
look at the options to augment the current power 
generation capacity by promoting and exploring energy resources for both electrical power and 
thermal energy generation, an analysis of other 
renewable, non-conventional, and fossil fuel 
resources has been carried out. This analysis aims 
at giving a holistic view of the energy resources 
and supply position. The overall objectives are as 
follows.
To reduce heavy dependence on hydropower 
(more than 99% of the electricity produced in 
the country is hydropower).
To augment electricity supply or reduce demand 
during winter season so as to meet the challenge 
of low hydroelectricity production due to lower 
water fl ows in rivers.
To reduce the use of fossil fuels in the transport 
sector. 
To introduce environment-friendly and locally 
available fuels/energy resources to meet demand 
for energy, especially in remote and dispersed 
locations.
BIOENERGY
Bioenergy (biomass energy) refers to the use of 
plant and other organic materials to provide desired 
forms of energy and energy services such as heat, 
light/electricity, and motive power. Bioenergy has 
been a primary source of energy since human 
civilizations discovered fi re. Even today, bioenergy 
accounts for about 11% of the world’s total 
primary energy supply of 420 exajoules (EJ) a year 
(ESMAP 2005). Forest-based biomass has been 
the main source of energy in Bhutan for many 
centuries. Abundantly and freely available biomass 
has become the natural choice for fuel for the rural 
population of Bhutan. 
 Bioenergy has been reviewed briefl y in the 
following sections so as to develop a deeper 
understanding of this form of energy. Some 
bioenergy-related issues are also highlighted 
(Box 2).
 Biomass largely consists of unrefi ned fuels that 
are used in a traditional way, such as solid biomass 
used in traditional cook stoves for cooking, water 
heating, and space heating.

as pellets, briquettes, bio-diesel, and biogas) and/
or are used in the effi cient equipment (such as 
improved cook stoves and gasifi ers). This usage is 
collectively termed as ‘modern’ bioenergy. 
 The modern bioenergy has been playing small 
but increasingly signifi cant role in recent times. It 
assumes greater signifi cance in several countries 
and economic sectors, especially in well-forested 
countries with large forestry-based industries and/
or the countries with cold winters and large space 
heating demands (ESMAP 2005). For example, in 
Finland and Sweden, modern bioenergy accounts 
for 33%–36% of total energy used by the industry 
sector, of which 11%–12% of energy is used for 
electricity generation, combined heat and power 
(CHP) generation, and district heating (IEA 2002, 
2003a). Interest in modern bioenergy has been 
increasing worldwide. It is increasingly occupying 
centrestage in renewable energy plans and policies, 
especially in the developing countries, because of 
myriad practical, social, and economic advantages 
that it offers. 
 Modern bioenergy offers fi ve major advantages 
over fossil and/or other renewable energy 
resources.
1 It is a widely available resource.
2 Bioenergy is essentially stored energy and is 
available all the times. 
3 Bioenergy can be converted to all major energy 
forms like electricity, liquid fuels or gaseous 
fuels for use in stationary as well as transport 
applications.
4 It does not contribute to greenhouse gas 
concentrations. Apart from being ‘carbon 
neutral’, it also contributes to habitat 
preservation, watershed protection, and soil 
conservation. 
5 Modern bioenergy is widely thought to play 
a key role in promoting rural development 
(UNDP 1995). In developing countries like 
Bhutan, bioenergy can form a basis for rural 
employment and income generation, thus 
helping curb migration from rural to urban 
areas. Use of liquid biofuels
Liquid biofuels such as straight vegetable oils 
(SVO) and bio-diesel are currently being explored 
as alternatives to petroleum fuels, especially for the 
transport sector. However, in case of Bhutan, these 
fuels will have limited role to play due to limited 
land available for cultivation. In Bhutan, only about 
7% of the land is under cultivation. The rest of the 
land has forest cover. Wasteland constitutes a very 
small area, and hence, bio-oil-bearing plantation 
for bio-diesel production will have direct confl ict 
with food security and agriculture production.
 Biomass fuels,2
 primarily sourced from forests, 
play a vital role in the economy of Bhutan, as they 
are the main energy source for a large number 
of rural enterprises, apart from majority of 
households in the rural and urban areas of the 
country. The country consumed about 724 000 
tonnes of fi rewood during 2005, which accounted 
for almost 57% of the total primary energy supply. 
With the sustainable yield for timber and fuelwood 
estimated at 1 565 540 tonnes/year, biomass would 
continue to remain an important source of energy 
for Bhutan. 
Biomass-based power generation
Biomass-based power generation – either through 
direct combustion or through gasifi cation route 
– is an established technology worldwide. Further, 
with the hydropower generation being seasonal 
in Bhutan, biomass-based power generation can 
provide an option to increase the power generation 
capacity for continuous power generation. Besides, 
biomass used for power generation can contribute 
Bioenergy has its own limitations. Bioenegry activities are labour-, land-, and resource-intensive. Bioenergy 
activities directly aff ect communities. Most importantly, supply side activities set bioenergy apart from other 
renewable energy resources that are freely available. In contrast, bioenergy resources must be grown, harvested, 
gathered, and transported to the energy conversion plant, sometimes from large number of dispersed suppliers. 
These must be stored, dried, and/or processed – chopped or pelletized – for using them as biofuel (Energy Sector 
Management Assistance Program [ESMAP] 2005). While supply chain activities can bring substantial benefi ts 
in the form of local employment and income, they may also raise serous problems like competitive land use 
and labour system, which form the backbone of rural economies. This necessitates the need for evaluating the 
impacts of bioenergy project on rural employment and the environment. The risk to existing biomass-dependent 
social groups or activities should also be taken into account. 
 The ESMAP study has identifi ed seven main areas of particular importance to bioenergy project development, 
as listed below.
1 Resource competition Most biofuels have other uses as well. So, biofuels may face price competition. 
Competition with nonmonetized traditional biomass supplies that provide essential ‘survival’ energy is 
common and must be dealt with at early stages of project planning.
2 Land competition Energy plantation may compete for land with other plantations or other uses. 
3 Land intensity Bioenergy plants are highly land intensive. For example, they typically require roughly 100 
times more land than solar photovoltaics to produce same amount of electricity. This physically limits the 
feasibility of bioenergy systems. 
4 Labour intensity 
5 Handling requirements Bioenergy fuels are relatively bulky and need infrastructure to handle. 
6 Environmental concerns Biomass systems, if not well designed, can have adverse impacts on soil quality, water 
resources, biodiversity, and landscape.
7 Supply uncertainty and risks
2
 The term biomass generally refers to the renewable organic matter that originates from living organisms, for example, wood, agricultural 
residues, animal manure, so on.this demonstration plant, the DoE can further plan 
for additional biomass-based power generation. 
The proposed 5-MW biomass-based power 
plant can be supported by energy plantation to 
ensure sustainable fuel supply. A detailed technoeconomic analysis of such a plant is presented in 
Annexure 4.2. Salient features of 5-MW biomassbased power plant are as follows.
Capital cost Nu 225 million
Fuel consumption 2 kg/kWh
Biomass required 15 000 tonnes/year
Electricity production 30.66 MU/year
Off-grid power generation using biomass
The small-scale biomass gasifi er is an established 
technology, wherein the producer gas produced in 
the gasifi er can be used for various applications, 
including power generation. The locally available 
biomass can be used for decentralized power 
generation using biomass gasifi ers. These biomassgasifi er-based power plants can be deployed in 
remote off-grid locations. It is suggested that 
fi ve biomass-gasifi er-based decentralized power 
plants for rural electrifi cation be established as 
demonstration projects on priority. Typically, these 
plants have capacities ranging from 5 kW to 100 
kW and can be established for supplying gridquality power for a village or groups of villages. 
Gasifi er-based grid power generation 
(5–100 kW)
Capital cost Nu 0.1 million/kW
Fuel consumption 1.6 kg/kWh
Thermal applications of biomass
Biomass is currently used for heating and cooking 
purposes in the residential and institutional 
sectors. The present biomass appliance/technology 
can be changed to modern effi cient biomass 
technologies like gasifi er and briquetting for 
thermal applications. Biomass gasifi ers can be used 
description of the biomass densifi cation technology 
is given in Annexure 4.3, and biomass gasifi cation 
technologies and their thermal applications are 
briefl y discussed in Annexure 4.4.
 The success of the sawdust briquetting plant 
operated by the Forest Development Corporation 
Ltd (FDCL) indicates the potential for the use 
of biomass/saw dust briquettes for thermal 
applications. In this regard, the DoE can develop a 
programme for sawdust and biomass briquetting in 
the Tenth Plan. The small-sized sawdust briquetting 
in combination with individual sawmills could 
immediately go onstream. This programme can 
include the promotion of effi cient cooking/heating 
appliances. 
Pelletization
Pelletization is now a well-established technology 
in Europe. Pellets are produced from various 
raw materials like agro-waste, sawdust, and pine 
needles. Pellets are easy to handle and transport, 
and advanced automatic pellet stoves and space 
heaters have made pellets simple and effi cient to 
use. The Renewable Energy Division of the DoE 
can take up a feasibility study on adopting pellet 
technology in Bhutan. With vast areas under pine 
and other forests, pellet manufacturing from 
forest waste can substantially reduce the demand 
for fuelwood for space heating in both urban and 
rural areas. 
 Similarly, demonstration of biomass gasifi er 
for thermal application like institutional cooking, 
cardamom drying, and lemon grass oil extraction 
can be taken up in the Tenth Plan.
Wind energy
Wind-based electricity generation is now a welldeveloped commercialized technology. Worldwide, 
wind energy is increasingly being utilized. Bhutan 
does have good wind potential; however, the 
development of wind farms is still constrained by 
various issues, as discussed subsequently. capacities are installed on 50–80-m-high tower, and 
wind generator blades are typically 20–30 m long. 
Current road infrastructure may not be adequate 
to transport these blades and heavy machinery.
Public opinion about wind machines
During the discussions with offi cials and policymakers, it was found that there were certain 
reservations on the installation of large wind 
machines due to the concerns about natural beauty 
for which Bhutan is famous. 
Small wind machines and water pumping 
wind mills
Bhutan, thus, can explore small wind machines of 
capacity less than 100 kW and mechanical wind 
pumps to generate electricity in isolated locations 
for scattered households and can use water 
pumping mills for providing water for irrigation and 
drinking. A detailed technology write-up on small 
wind machines is presented in Annexure 4.5.
 Small wind machines can also be coupled with 
solar photovoltaic power plants in hybrid mode to 
generate electricity for small villages. These isolated 
and distributed power generation technologies can 
play an important role in reducing time and cost 
of extending infrastructure to supply electricity to 
far-fl ung areas. These minigrids can be connected 
to main grid, once the grid is established. 
Solar energy
Bhutan has reasonably good solar energy 
potential. Although detailed time series ground 
measurement data is not yet available, the solar 
energy resources quantifi ed at various places 
and solar energy resource map developed for the 
region under Solar and Wind Energy Resource 
Assessment (SWERA) project of the United 
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) have 
shown a resource potential of 4.5–5 kWh/m2
 in 
various locations.
 Solar energy can be exploited in various ways, 
but two major ways to use solar energy in Bhutan 
are as follows.
1 Solar systems, which include solar thermal 
systems such as water heating systems and solar 
photovoltaic systems. 
2 Solar passive systems for building heating.
Various solar technologies are being developed 
worldwide, and various products are available 
in the market. Few systems such as solar home 
lighting systems and solar water heating systems 
are useful for distributed applications in the 
residential sector. These are discussed in detail in 
the next chapter.
Solar photovoltaic for power generation
Solar photovoltaic technologies are expensive but 
can be considered as an alternative for electricity 
production. Grid-connected solar photovoltaic 
plants of few hundred kilowatt capacities are 
generally cheaper. Currently, solar photovoltaic 
power generation costs are in the range Nu 15–30/
kWh, depending on the site, technology, and size of 
the plant. These costs are, thus, very high compared 
to hydropower generation costs unless the cost of 
grid extension as well as low capacity utilization 
of this infrastructure are also taken into account. 
However, solar photovoltaic is an excellent option 
for distributed generation, since solar resource is 
freely available; systems are modular, stationary, 
and easy to install; there are no moving parts, 
and O&M is cheaper. Hence, the technology can 
be considered on demonstration basis by installing 
plants of, say, 100-kW capacity. Currently, under 
the Integrated Energy Management Master Plan 
(IEMMP) project, the DoE has planned to install 
are produced from raw silica/sand using energyintensive process mostly using electricity. Since Bhutan 
has cheap and renewable hydro energy in abundance, 
use of hydro energy for manufacturing solar PV wafers/
cells can be an interesting application to produce ‘green 
solar cells’. Some solar cell manufacturers have shown 
interest in this concept. Installation of such a plant in 
this region can bring down the cost of solar PV cells and 
systems substantially, making them cost-eff ective.HYDROGEN AS ALTERNATIVE ENERGY CARRIER 
CUM STORAGE
Hydrogen is emerging as a clean energy carrier in 
recent times. Though hydrogen technologies are 
still in development and testing phase, considering 
the thrust and importance given to the research and 
development for developing hydrogen technologies, 
it is expected that hydrogen can become a major 
energy carrier and energy storage option in 
coming years. If generated from renewable energy 
resources such as sun, wind, and water, hydrogen 
generation is pollution free. Hydrogen is also being 
considered as a viable fuel for the transport sector, 
which so far is heavily dependent on petroleum 
fuels such as diesel, petrol, liquefi ed petroleum 
gas (LPG), and natural gas. 
 Hydrogen can be used directly as a fuel in 
modifi ed internal combustion engines or turbines, 
either in mixed fuel mode or as a single fuel. 
Another technology being developed is hydrogen 
fuel cell technology. Fuel cells are electrochemical 
devices that produce electricity from externally 
supplied fuel (hydrogen) and oxidant (oxygen). 
Wind and hydropower technologies are currently 
being evaluated in the US, European countries, 
Japan, and other countries as electricity sources that 
could enable the production of large quantities of 
low-cost renewable hydrogen for use in distributed 
generation and transportation. This will facilitate 
the use of hydrogen storage for off-peak storage 
of hydropower. In the context of Bhutan, where 
hydropower is abundantly available but suffers from 
seasonal variations, hydrogen can be considered as 
a storage medium to store hydroelectricity, which 
is environment-friendly. Although wind power is 
not being utilized for the commercial production 
of electricity, in near future, wind energy resources 
can also be exploited for decentralized electricity 
and hydrogen production. By 2020, smallerscale stand-alone and/or grid-connected systems 
serving local transportation fl eets and distributed 
power generation schemes can be envisaged. 
Indian research organizations have developed 
hydrogen-powered motorcycles and generator sets 
announced an ambitious project that envisages 
introducing 10 million two- and three-wheelers 
running on hydrogen in India. The Government 
of India and the RGoB can take up a joint project 
to explore hydrogen production using hydropower 
and/or wind energy. This would be a major step in 
enhancing energy security for Bhutan.
 Recently, Young and others have published a 
paper, which considers the use of hydrogen as 
storage media for hydropower plants in Bhutan. 
The paper discusses the feasibility of generating 
hydrogen using excess electricity available from 
Sengor Hydropower Plant. The paper estimates 
the total cost of system (including 100-kW 
hydropower plant at a cost of $190 000) to be 
$1424 775. Besides Sengor project, the paper also 
discusses various options for unelectrifi ed Thanza 
Hamlet. 
 Sengor Power Plant is now operational, and 
it has a potential to generate 876 000 kWh per 
annum. The plant has connected load of capacity 
20 kW. Currently, only about 100 000 kWh is likely 
to be used in a year (Box 3). It would be interesting 
to consider hydrogen technology options in near 
future. The Renewable Energy Division of the DoE 
can look at this option as futuristic technology 
development, and a donor-assisted project can 
be initiated to study the hydrogen production 
and storage option for future, in conjunction with 
hydropower plants. 
 It is recommended that a project, which would 
evaluate a realistic path for hydrogen production 
and storage from these two renewable energy 
resources – water and hydrogen – be taken up 
as a fi rst step. This project could also examine 
how to integrate this technology in nation’s energy 
infrastructure, if found feasible. 
Geothermal energy
Geothermal energy is the heat energy available 
in the core of the earth. The exploitation of 
geothermal energy to meet heat requirements 
and/or produce electricity is common in certain 
countries like Iceland, USA, and the Philippines. Details on the geothermal energy technologies are 
given in Annexure 4.6.
Geothermal potential and its exploitation in 
Bhutan
Several hot springs (tsachhus) are known to exist in 
Bhutan. These occur in two regions—in northern 
Bhutan at Gasa, Punakha, upper Trongsa, 
Bumthang, and Lhunetse dzongkhags and in 
southern Bhutan at Rongkhola and Bhurkhola. 
These are traditionally used for bathing, as the 
water is believed to have medicinal and healing 
properties. In 1996, a reconnaissance study of 
thermal springs and medicinal water springs 
(menchhus) in Gasa and Punakha Dzongkahg was 
carried out by the Geology and Mines Division, 
Ministry of Trade and Industries (Gyenden 
1996).
 The study included analysing soil and water 
sample, studying geology around the area, and 
collecting information on medicinal properties of 
the thermal springs, besides registering medicinal 
plants en route. 
 The study report mentions that the temperature 
of the spring water ranges between 40 °C and 
50 °C. Highest temperature of 50 °C was recorded 
at Chubu Tsachhu, which is located in North 
East Tsachuphu village and is approachable by 
motorable road up to Samdinkha from Wangdi 
Phodrang. 
 In short term, it is possible to use hot water 
springs for space heating in the houses in the 
vicinity and also in guest houses for tourists, as 
a demonstration project. Drying facilities for 
agricultural products and medicinal herb can 
also be established in the areas around the hot

Energy Division can conduct a detailed feasibility 
study in the Tenth Plan. 
 In medium and long term, detailed exploration 
and plotting of thermal profi les of the underground 
sources, along with the study of geological 
structures, are required to establish the potential 
and feasibility for the large-scale use of geothermal 
energy in the region for applications like electricity 
generation. These studies could be undertaken by 
the Department of Geology and Mines, along with 
the Renewable Energy Division of the DoE. 
 Further, geological study and exploration of 
thermal potential for direct use of geothermal 
energy can be taken up in future.
WASTE-TO-ENERGY
Waste generation is increasingly being associated 
with human settlement and rapid urbanization, 
with the problem of proper management of solid 
waste so generated also showing an upward trend. 
Thimphu and Phuentsholing alone generate 
about 37 tonnes and 25 tonnes of solid waste, 
respectively, daily, containing a lot of organic matter 
(Bhutan Energy Data Directory 2005). It has been 
estimated that in Bhutan, about 81 119 tonnes 
of solid waste is generated annually. If this waste 
can be used for the generation of energy (either 
for electricity generation or for supplying thermal 
energy), besides augmenting the energy supply per 
se, it would take care of waste management as well. 
Bhutan has, therefore, potential to sustain over 3 
MW of power generation capacity. 
 To start with, a biomethanation system of 
capacity 1 tonne/day may be set up in Thimphu as 
a demonstration plant, treating its organic waste, 
including that generated from hotels and vegetable 
market. 
FOSSIL FUELS
In the absence of petroleum reserves in the country, 
Bhutan meets its requirement of the petroleum 
fuels – diesel, petrol, kerosene, and LPG – through 
imports from India.
diesel in the country, Bhutan can directly import 
bio-diesel blended diesel from India, once the 
Indian oil companies start supplying the blended 
diesel in suffi cient quantities. 
Natural gas based combined cycle power plant
As evident from the analysis of the peak demand 
in Bhutan and the fi rm power produced from the 
hydropower plant, there will be a gap of about 
250 MW in power supply during lean season 
till 2015 when Punasangtchu and Mangdechu 
power plants will get commissioned. To plug the 
gap between the peak demand and power supply 
during the lean season of hydropower generation, 
a natural gas based combined cycle power plant 
of an approximate capacity of 300 MW in Assam/
West Bengal is recommended. This plant may 
supply power to India during the summer, and 
during winter, Bhutan government can utilize all 
the power generated from it. Salient features of the 
plant are as follows.
Plant capacity 300 MW
Plant effi ciency 50%–52%

This project, which can be installed on the Indian 
side as a joint venture will offer the following 
advantages.
Lean power shortage is eliminated.
Bhutan’s energy security issue is addressed due 
to the diversity in fuel for power generation. 
Since currently, the majority of electricity is 
generated by two hydropower plants, which

Natural gas being a relatively cleaner fuel, the 
pollution impact is negligible. 
The gestation period is small (about two years); 
hence, it is a quicker and ideal solution 
Only barrier for this project could be the availability 
of natural gas.
Coal
Coal is primarily used in industries. The overall 
contribution of coal in the energy supply mix is 
only about 8%. Effi cient technologies for coal 
utilization can be promoted. Locally produced 
coal is mainly used for reduction processes in 
the industries. Coal-based power plants are not 
envisaged for following reasons.
Locally available coal is of poor quality and is 
available in limited quantity. 
Large hydropower potential is available. 
A coal plant may be useful for improving 
fi rm power, but it is not essential if medium 
hydropower plants are installed in next four to 
fi ve years.
CONCLUSION 
The above analysis clearly shows that being 
cheapest and pollution free, hydropower will remain

sector as equity partner or IPP or captive power 
producer is essential. It is essential to develop 
small- and medium-sized hydropower plants on 
fast track mode so as to avoid power shortages, 
especially in winter, with appropriate incentives 
and fi nancial packages for IPPs. 
 Other renewables can play an important but 
limited role in electricity generation. However, 
the establishment of demonstration plants using 
biomass, small wind, solar photovoltaic, and 
municipal solid waste should be considered to 
develop diverse resources, distributed generation, 
and energy security. 
 Energy-intensive industries could be encouraged 
to set up captive power plants to achieve twin 
goal of employment generation and industrial 
development without hampering the export of 
electricity or supply of electricity to the citizens of 
the country.
 The DoE could take up a study to prepare 
detailed feasibility report for setting up a solar 
photovoltaic silicon cell and wafer manufacturing 
industry in near future. Hydrogen and geothermal 
energy can be explored as futuristic options. 
 The potential of biomass for thermal applications 
in small-scale industries and for processing agro 
products can also be explored.
 Cheap and renewable hydroelectricity can be 
effectively used in the transport sector, which is 
an environment-friendly option.Energy demand management or demand 
side effi ciency enhancement strategies 
fundamentally aim at optimizing the 
use of energy delivered through end-use 
effi ciency enhancement, demand side management 
practices, and reduction in waste and unnecessary 
use, thus substantially increasing the ‘net’ energy 
available to end-users. 
 Taking clue from the projected energy 
consumption and predicted fuel mix for each 
sector, an attempt has been made to carry out an 
analysis, by sector, and prioritize various strategies 
for demand side effi ciency enhancement, along 
with the promotion of eco-friendly fuels and 
renewable energy resources so as to evolve a longterm strategy.
RESIDENTIAL SECTOR
The residential sector mainly consumes fuelwood, 
kerosene, liquefi ed petroleum gas (LPG), and 
electricity. 
 As discussed earlier, fuelwood accounts for more 
than 90% of the sector’s energy demand, and at the 
same time, fuelwood devices are hardly 10%–15% 
effi cient. Fuelwood is mainly used for cooking, 
space heating, and lighting. Similarly, kerosene is 
the most widely used fuel for lighting purpose in 
the residential sector. According to Census 2005 
of Bhutan, about 46 064 households use kerosene 
for lighting, while about 4502 households use 
fuelwood, candle or other resources for lighting. 
Hence, there is a need to put in place strategies 
for cutting down fuelwood as well as kerosene 
consumption in this sector. Reduction in the 
consumption of fuelwood and kerosene as well 
as in the total residential energy consumption 
or energy demand management
can be achieved by adopting one of the following 
strategies.
1 Improving the overall effi ciency 
2 Using modern or renewable energy sources
3 Developing energy-effi cient housings/buildings
Improvement in the overall efficiency
In the residential sector, the improvement in 
the overall effi ciency of the appliances used for 
cooking, space heating, and lighting will reduce 
the fuel consumption. The strategies for the 
improvement in the overall effi ciency in the fuel 
and energy consumption are as follows.
Strategy 1: Promotion of improved cook stove 
Goal
The main aim of this strategy is to reduce fuelwood 
consumption for cooking and space heating in 
rural households.
Approach 
Reduction in fuelwood consumption can be effected 
through awareness campaign and promoting 
fuel-effi cient cook stoves and bukharis. Eleven 
Dzongkhags – Dagana, Wangdue, Mongar, Tsirang, 
Haa, Trashiyangyse, Trashigang, Pemagatshel, and 
Sandrup Jongkhar – that have highest per capita 
fuelwood consumption and house more than 48% 
of the rural population can be targeted in the 
Tenth Plan.
 Giving subsidized electric cook stoves can also 
be considered a strategy in these Dzongkhags. 
Most of these Dzongkhags are located in 
central and eastern regions, which are mostly 
underdeveloped. ambitious programme on the distribution of 
effi cient cook stoves in Bhutan. The United 
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) offi ce 
in Bhutan had earlier supported improved cook 
stove programme, but such activities were not 
supported on a long-term basis. It is important to 
carry out this programme on a sustainable basis 
and for a longer period. 
Recommendations
It is recommended that a target of about 20 000 
improved cook stove installations in households 
can be set under the programme. A nationwide 
awareness campaign can also be undertaken. 
 The Department of Energy (DoE) can 
implement the programme with the help of NGOs 
such as Tarayana Foundation and Royal Society 
for Protection of Nature (RSPN). 
 Monitoring of fuelwood consumption in 
selected villages before and after implementation 
can indicate the impact of the programme. 
Strategy 2: Use of improved cook stoves for 
fodder cooking 
The Integrated Energy Management Master Plan 
(IEMMP) survey has estimated that about 26% 
of the energy consumed in the residential sector is 
used for fodder cooking in rural areas. Most of the 
fodder cooking is being done using conventional 
three-stone cook stoves. 
 Since fuelwood is available free of cost, 
alternative fuels such as LPG or electricity were 
not used for fodder cooking activities.
Goal
Reduce fuelwood consumption for fodder cooking 
by improving effi ciency.
Approach 
Improved cook stoves can be supplied free of cost 
through Dzongkhag offi ces, for fodder cooking. 
Specially designed turbo cook stoves developed by 
organizations such as The Energy and Resources 
Institute (TERI) can be tried on a demonstration 
basis. 
initiated in the Tenth Plan. These cook stoves 
can be distributed through subsidy programmes 
by renewable and natural resource centres. The 
Agriculture Machinery Centre (AMC) can be the 
focal agency for manufacturing and distribution 
of these stoves. 
Strategy 3: Promotion of CFLs, LED lamps, 
and other energy-efficient lighting fixtures in 
electrified areas
Compact fl uorescent lamps (CFLs) are effi cient 
and effective in saving electricity used for lighting. 
Bhutanese households commonly use electric 
bulbs for lighting. Replacement of these bulbs 
with CFLs can save as much as 80% of electricity 
used for lighting. Apart from CFLs, new types of 
effi cient tube lights and lighting systems based on 
light-emitting diodes (LED) are also available in 
the market. 
Goal
The main goal is to reduce the energy consumption 
in the electrifi ed areas by introducing energyeffi cient lighting systems. 
Approach
One approach is the promotion of CFLs and energyeffi cient lighting through awareness campaign. For 
areas having off-grid hydropower plants, supply of 
CFLs through subsidy/cost sharing scheme can 
also be considered. Similar experimental scheme 
implemented by the DoE and the Bhutan Power 
Corporation (BPC) in Ura Micro Hydro Power 
Project area in 2005 has shown good success.
Recommendations
In Thimphu/Phuentsholing and other urban areas, 
introduction of the CFL under promotional 
scheme for replacing bulb can be undertaken by 
the BPC. Certain number of CFLs, say four per 
households, can be provided to each consumer, 
and the cost of the same can be recovered through 
electricity bills. 
 Promotion of 36-watt tube light instead of 40-
watt tube lights is also being considered under Use of modern fuel and renewable energy 
sources
Strategy 4: Promotion of efficient LPG stoves
LPG is a modern cooking fuel, causing less 
pollution. It is an effi cient burning fuel and is easy 
and convenient to use.
 Use of LPG as cooking fuel is common in urban 
areas. However, in rural areas, LPG is still not a 
preferred fuel due to the following reasons. 
High cost mainly due to high transportation 
costs 
Limited availability 
Diffi culty in transporting it to the households. 
Goal 
Replacing fuelwood with LPG and effi cient use of 
LPG by introducing effi cient LPG cook stoves. 
Approach 
Small LPG cylinders that are easy to transport can 
be introduced. Figure 1 depicts a woman carrying 
LPG cylinder. Simultaneously, energy-effi cient 
LPG cook stoves can also be introduced. 
Recommendations
It is expected that LPG consumption is likely 
to increase by three to four times by 2020. 
Introduction of standards and labelling system for 
LPG cook stove can help in introducing effi cient 
#
#
#
cook stoves is possible.
Strategy 5: Use of briquettes and pellets for 
space heating
Briquettes made from saw dusts are now available 
in Thimphu region, which are mainly supplied 
through briquetting plant set up by the Natural 
Resources Development Corporation (NRDC). 
Similar briquetting plants can be installed at other 
places so that briquettes are available in most parts 
of the country. Further, small pellets made from 
sawdust and forest waste can be used for space 
heating. Pellet manufacturing is a major industry 
in Europe, and sophisticated pellet stoves are also 
available.
Goal
The strategy is to reduce fuelwood consumption 
for space heating.
Approach
Pellets and briquettes can be produced from saw 
dust and forest wastes. Pine needles and other forest 
waste can be effectively used for manufacturing 
pellets. 
Recommendations
Small-scale saw dust should be introduced along 
with forest waste briquetting and pelletizing in 
various towns of the country. Simultaneously, new 
energy-effi cient pellet stoves and boilers should 
also be introduced in towns.
Strategy 6: Promotion of solar lanterns and 
home lighting systems in unelectrified areas
Proper lighting is the basic requirement in a 
modern society. It is not only important from 
health point of view but is also essential for socioeconomic development, as it gives an opportunity 
to people to extend their working hours and also 
enables students to study for longer period. People 
can carry on with their day-to-day activities even 
after sunset.
 According to the Census 2005, there are about 
46 064 households that use kerosene as a primary FIGURE 1 A WOMAN CARRYING LPG CYLINDERlighting purpose in households in Bhutan.
Goal
To reduce the use of imported kerosene as well as 
to reduce indoor pollution and provide improved 
lighting to rural unelectrifi ed households. 
Approach
Though all households will eventually be 
covered under rural electrifi cation programme, 
an immediate and intermediate solution can 
be providing solar lighting systems and solar 
lanterns. 
Recommendations
Solar lanterns are designed to provide quality light 
for about two to six hours. Solar home lighting 
systems are typically designed with two to four 
CFL tube lights and an additional point for small 
radio or TV. 
 Both these products are commercially available 
in the international and local markets. They are 
training rural youth in installation and operation 
and maintenance (O&M) of these systems. About 
300 rural women were trained recently under 
an Asian Development Bank (ADB)-funded 
programme. 
 Promotion of solar lantern and/or solar home 
lighting systems as an interim solution for lighting 
can be done in two ways. 
1 Direct sale Direct sale of solar lanterns and 
home lighting systems to individual households 
under subsidy scheme can be promoted through 
the Dzongkhag offi ces or the Bank of Bhutan 
or Bhutan Development Finance Corporation 
(BDFC) or Renewable Natural Resource 
(RNR) centres. 
2 Solar women entrepreneur scheme Solar 
entrepreneurs, especially women, can be 
groomed, who can set up charging stations 
for charging solar lanterns during daytime and 
rent them to users during night-time. However, 
the scattered nature of village households and 
FIGURE 2 SOURCES OF LIGHTING IN HOUSEHOLDS (CENSUS 2005)rural women on solar home lighting systems 
as ‘barefoot engineer’ from Barefoot College, 
Tilonia, and Rajasthan, India. These women 
can be further trained to run small business of 
renting solar lantern. 
Simultaneously, the use of kerosene wick lamps 
should be discouraged through awareness 
campaign. 
 Solar home lighting systems are already being 
promoted in Bhutan under different funding 
programmes. Most of these are promoted in 
rural areas that fall under protected forest areas. 
Recently, proposed draft Renewable Energy Policy 
by the DoE envisaged supply of solar home 
lighting systems to 3018 households for off-grid 
electrifi cation. The same scheme can be extended 
to the households in rural areas, where electricity is 
not likely to reach for another four to fi ve years.
Strategy 7: Promotion of solar water heating 
systems
Water heating is another end use application in 
Bhutan, which consumes a lot of energy. Water is 
heated mostly in kitchen or by using bukharis. 
 Solar water heating systems have proved their 
effectiveness in saving electricity and other fuels 
that are used for heating water. 
Goal 
The main goal under this strategy is to introduce 
solar water heating systems to save electricity and 
fuelwood.
Approach
In Bhutan, initial studies carried out by the DoE 
through Austrian consultants have shown that 
these systems may not be cost-effective. TERI team 
carried out an analysis of solar water heating system 
with the help of RETScreen software by using 
cost details provided by the local solar system 
supplier. The analysis showed that subsidy and 
soft loans are required for making solar system 
attractive, and the cost of transportation and 
Recommendations
The DoE has already carried out initial studies 
on solar water heating systems for institutional 
consumers. The studies have established the fact 
that these systems are workable, but the costs are 
very high. Moreover, electricity and fuelwood – two 
most commonly used fuels for water heating – are 
very cheap. Therefore, following suggestions are 
made for promoting solar water heating systems. 
Initially, solar water heating systems can be 
promoted in urban areas through awareness 
campaign. Special soft loans can be made available 
to interested users through the BDFC. 
The DoE may also offer a rebate on monthly 
electricity bills for those users who have installed 
solar water heating systems.
Similarly, a rebate may be given on annual 
municipal/property taxes to commercial and 
institutional buildings with solar water heating 
systems.
Specially designed smaller and lighter systems 
using plastics can be installed on demonstration 
basis. 
Strategy 8: Use of hydrogen as a cooking fuel
In future, the potential of hydrogen production 
using hydropower to store surplus hydro energy 
can be explored. A pilot study and a pilot plant 
for hydrogen production and storage have been 
suggested elsewhere in this report. Use of hydrogen 
for cooking can be explored at a later stage. Issues 
such as costs and safety need to be addressed 
before this technology can be recommended for 
large-scale use. Figure 3 shows a hydrogen cook 
stove developed by Banaras Hindu University, 
Varanasi.
 The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy 
(MNRE), Government of India, has been funding 
various research programmes on hydrogen 
technology development. Some of the technologies, 
such as hydrogen-based motorcycles, can be tested 
in Bhutan in future. 
#
#
#Development of energy efficient housings/
buildings
Energy consumption for lighting and space heating 
can be reduced by using suitably designed houses 
and buildings. Eco-friendly housing designed to 
reduce heat loss and use daylight for internal lighting 
is effective in reducing the energy consumption 
for space heating and lighting. A brief note on 
energy conservation techniques in the buildings is 
presented in Annexure 5.1. Following strategy is 
suggested for the introduction of energy-effi cient 
housing in Bhutan.
Strategy 9: To introduce energy-efficient 
housing in Bhutan
Goal
The goal of this strategy is to introduce energyeffi cient buildings in Bhutan.
Approach
The energy-effi cient building designs can be 
introduced initially for new housing complexes 
being developed by government agencies
Recommendations
External expert agencies can be initially involved 
in developing designs. This can be simultaneously 
followed by organizing capacity building training 
courses for architects and builders. The DoE can 
develop such courses jointly with the Government 
of India and government agencies like Bureau of 
Energy Effi ciency (BEE).
Energy conservation in buildings in Bhutan
Design concept of eco-housing and eco-friendly 
building ensures the following. 
Overall site planning and design of building 
architecture have coherence and integration 
with the surroundings.
All buildings are oriented and designed for 
energy effi ciency and use natural climatic 
conditions to reduce energy consumption by 
adopting passive solar design concepts.
Conservation and effi cient use of natural 
resources such as rainwater available at site are 
ensured.
Renewable energy is used, such as using solar 
energy for water heating and space heating, using 
biogas for cooking, and using other renewable 
energies, wherever applicable.
Eco-friendly, low-embedded energy materials, 
and energy saving building materials are used.
Energy-effi cient technologies and appliances 
are used to reduce energy consumption in the 
building. For example, using heat pumps for 
space heating and cooling, using insulation in 
walls and roofs for reducing heat loss, and using 
energy-effi cient lighting fi xtures.
Bhutan has developed its own traditional housing 
and building design guidelines, which are being 
followed strictly. 
 Traditionally, locally made mud bricks and 
traditional housing construction techniques using 
bamboo and mud are still used in rural areas. 
However, in urban areas, the practice of using 
cement and concrete for construction, and using 
galvanized iron (GI) sheets for roofi ng material is 
prevalent.
 In the context of Bhutan, following are the 
recommendations to develop and adopt ecofriendly and energy-effi cient housing codes and 
concepts.
National-level awareness programmes and 
capacity-building programmes for common 
citizens and architects need to be developed.

FIGURE 3 HYDROGEN COOK STOVE DEVELOPED BY 
BANARAS HINDU UNIVERSITY, VARANASI for weather data, best practices, design norms 
for Bhutanese weather conditions, alternative 
materials, and so on. 
Materials like bamboo and mud walls need to 
be analysed and documented.
The use of bamboo and its products for 
buildings, such as mats for walls and bamboobased roofi ng materials, can be explored. 
Currently used GI sheet roofi ng material can 
be replaced with bamboo mats. 
Workshops for architects and construction 
agencies to sensitize them on energy conservation 
and energy effi ciency in buildings should be 
conducted.
Agencies like Standards and Quality Control 
Authority (SQCA), National Housing 
Development Corporation, Construction 
Association of Bhutan, National Environment 
Commission, Ministry of Works and Human 
Settlement, and Urban Development 
Department can work together towards 
developing energy-effi cient buildings. 
Some specifi c recommendations that can be 
considered are as follows.
 Longer façades should face the north–south 
direction.
 Spacing between buildings should take into 
account winter sunpath and should get 
maximum radiation on south glazing for 
direct solar space heating.
 Spaces that are occupied during the day time 
in residential units should face south side.
 Night-time spaces should be located on the 
north side, with thermal insulation on the 
north wall.
 Insulation is also recommended for the walls 
on the east and west sides.
 There should be double-shuttered doubleglazing windows.
 Heaters with timers should be used for 
different heating set points for day and night 
operations. 
 Glazing should be on the south wall, with 
internal low ‘e’ glass.

General recommendations
Since capital cost of energy-effi cient/renewable 
energy devices is a major barrier in adopting 
them, a common loan scheme for energyeffi cient/renewable energy devices can be taken 
into consideration. This loan scheme can provide 
loans on convenient terms to individuals for the 
purchase of energy-effi cient/renewable energy 
devices certifi ed by the DoE. Till the time such 
labelling facilities are developed in the country, 
energy/star-labelled energy-effi cient devices as well 
as those renewable energy systems that conform 
to international standards may be endorsed by the 
DoE for use in Bhutan.
 Small isolated houses can explore small wind 
machines and small solar photovoltaic (PV) 
power plants for providing electricity to the 
households. Wind/solar hybrid pumps can be used 
in farmhouses.
COMMERCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL SECTOR
The commercial and institutional sector comprises 
four major types of consumers as far as energy is 
concerned
1 Bulk users like armed forces, monastic bodies, 
schools, hospitals
2 Tourism activities
3 Commercial offi ces
4 Small shops
Bulk users use energy for cooking, water heating, 
lighting, and space heating, while shops and 
commercial offi ces use energy mostly for lighting, 
space heating, and running other appliances like 
computers and printers. Most commonly used 
fuel in these sectors are fuelwood for cooking and 
water heating, mainly by bulk users, monastic 
bodies, schools and hospitals, and so on, and 
electricity for lighting and heating, mainly by the 
hotel industries and commercial offi ces. Following 
paragraphs describe the strategies that can be used 
for the reduction in the demand for fuelwood and 
kerosene and can be helpful in saving electricity.sources
Development of energy-effi cient buildings
Promoting the use of energy-efficient 
appliances
Strategy 10: Use of energy-efficient cook 
stoves and other devices for cooking
Army units, monastic bodies situated in remote 
areas, and schools with hostels use fuelwood-based 
cook stoves for cooking.
 Wood-fi red water-jacketed cook stoves, 
commonly known as Althaps, which are produced 
locally, are found to be used in many places. 
These were developed under the UNDP-funded 
projects. 
Goal
Goal of this approach is to promote the use of 
energy-effi cient cook stoves for these institutions.
Approach
Reduction in fuelwood consumption can be 
encouraged through awareness campaign and 
promoting fuel-effi cient cook stoves and bukharis. 
Recommendations
The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) was 
recently engaged in promoting electric rice and 
curry cookers for institutional users. These cookers 
have shown good potential for saving fuelwood. 
#
 In urban areas where LPG and electricity are 
available, the use of effi cient LPG cook stoves, 
and electric rice cookers and curry cookers is 
recommended.
 Turbo cook stoves, or wood gas cook stoves, 
can be introduced in the institutional segment. 
Canada International Agency (<http://www.
acdi-cida.gc.ca/CIDAWEB/acdicida.nsf/ En/STE320162243-T98>) also distributed effi cient cook 
stoves in schools in Bhutan. Such projects can be 
taken up more aggressively through coordinated 
efforts for effective distribution, effi cient aftersales service, and post-project monitoring.
Strategy 11: Promotion of CFL and other 
energy-efficient lighting fixtures in 
commercial buildings
CFLs are effi cient and effective in saving 
electricity that is used for lighting. Commonly 
used appliances are electric bulbs for lighting. 
Replacement of these bulbs with CFLs can save 
as much as 80% of electricity used for lighting. 
Box 1 gives the comparison of an 11-W CFL and 
a 60-W incandescent lamp.
Goal
The main aim is to reduce energy consumption 
in the commercial and institutional sector by 
introducing energy-effi cient lighting systems.

Energy saving 60% —
Simple payback periods (months) 2 to 3 —Providing CFLs through subsidy/cost-sharing 
scheme can also be considered. 
Recommendations
In Thimphu/Phuentsholing and other urban areas, 
introduction of the CFL under promotional 
scheme for replacing bulb can be undertaken 
under an appropriate programme launched by the 
DoE through a designated department. 
 Energy audit may be made compulsory for big 
hotels, commercial complexes, and institutions. 
This will motivate the users to switch to the use 
of energy-effi cient CFL lights and other electrical 
fi xtures.
Strategy 12: Introducing energy efficiency in 
the hotel industry
The hotel industry is an integral part of the tourism 
industry. Energy effi ciency measures focused on 
hotel industry would go a long way towards ecotourism and energy savings.
 Hotels in Bhutan vary from simple lodges to fi vestar hotels built by international groups. Typically, 
hotels in Bhutan have about 20–30 rooms. The 
tourism department has planned to develop and 
upgrade facilities of the existing hotels to three- or 
four-star grade. 
 Use of energy-effi cient LPG cook stoves and 
lighting fi xtures will reduce the total energy 
demand of the hotels.
Recommendations
Energy auditing can be made mandatory for 
hotels having a minimum of 20 rooms. The 
DoE can provide the auditing support. 
These hotels can be asked to submit the details 
of energy consumption to the DoE on an annual 
basis. Over a period of time, norms for energy 
consumptions can be developed for the hotel 
industry. 
Hotels can be encouraged to adopt energy 
effi ciency through star rating systems.
#
#
#
Strategy 13: Promotion of dish-type solar 
cookers
Dish-type solar cooker may be promoted in 
the monastic bodies, schools/colleges hostels, 
hotels, and so on, where large-scale cooking is 
required. This will help in reducing the fuelwood 
consumption for cooking. 
Strategy 14: Promotion of solar water heaters
Solar water heaters are the most useful devices for 
saving fuelwood as well as electricity, which are 
being used for heating water in most of the hotels 
and institutions. These institutions can be provided 
with special incentives to install solar water heating 
systems to meet their hot water requirement. 
Although there are hindrances to installing solar 
water heaters, such as low cost of electricity and 
lack of required infrastructure, know-how, and 
service network, the DoE can promote the use 
of solar water heaters by undertaking awareness 
campaigns, highlighting their environmental 
benefi ts, providing incentives to the user, and 
making them compulsory for large hotels.
Strategy 15: Promotion of solar PV and small 
wind-based power plants 
Solar PV based power plants and small wind-based 
power plants may be promoted in institutions, 
especially monasteries and schools. This will 
reduce the dependency on hydropower, especially 
in winter when the power from hydro system 
become less. This solar PV and small wind-based 
plants will also help in electrifying the rural area 
where grid electricity has not reached.
Development of energy-efficient buildings 
Energy consumption in buildings can effectively 
be reduced by suitably designing the buildings. 
The DoE may promote the development of ecofriendly buildings, which are designed to reduce 
heat loss and use daylight for internal lighting.Goal 
The main aim of this strategy is to introduce 
energy-effi cient commercial buildings in Bhutan
Approach
New offi ce buildings of Royal Government of 
Bhutan can be made energy effi cient on the lines 
of the new building of the DoE. This design can 
be extended to other institutions also.
Recommendations
An energy-effi cient building code for Bhutan may 
be developed, and it should be incumbent on 
hotels and big institutions buildings, including the 
commercial offi ce buildings, to follow this code as 
per the building category. To generate awareness 
on these energy-effi cient buildings, the DoE may 
organize some training courses for the owners 
of the buildings, builders, and the government 
department. 
INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
The industrial sector mainly consumes electricity, 
fuelwood, furnace oil, and coal. The country’s 
growth is based on the industrial growth, which 
is taking place at a rapid pace. Because of this 
growth, energy consumption in the country, as 
discussed in Chapter 3, is enormous. To reduce 
energy consumption in the industrial sector, specifi c 
strategies for different categories of industries are 
required. As Bhutan has good potential for electricity 
generation and is dependent on the import of fuels 
like furnace oil and coal, it is necessary to reduce 
the consumption of fuelwood, coal, and oil by 
the industries. The strategy for fuel consumption 
reduction in the industries is as follows.
Strategy 17: Promote the use of energyefficient equipment and technologies in 
small- and medium-scale industries
Goal
The main aim of this strategy is to improve energy 
effi ciency and reduce energy consumption as 
well as pollution in the small- and medium-scale 
industries
these measures will save approximately 10% of 
electricity in future. 
Implementation strategy
The DoE has established an energy laboratory under 
the IEMMP project. The laboratory facilities and 
the infrastructure available with the Department 
of Industries on Training and Capacity Building 
can be used to develop training and energy audit 
programmes for small-scale industries
 The programmes can be developed for specifi c 
types of industries such as textile, paper, food 
processing, and so on. 
Barriers
Small-scale industries may fi nd investments 
in energy effi ciency equipment an expensive 
proposition. Lack of awareness is one of the 
reasons for not using effi cient devices.
 Demand side management in new industries 
should be followed diligently for reducing the total 
demand for energy. 
Energy demand reduction strategies, by 
industry
Ferro alloys
From earlier analysis, it is observed that the 
ferro alloy industry is one of the most energyintensive industries in Bhutan and a signifi cant 
consumer of electricity. This industry accounts 
for more than one-third of the domestic electric 
consumption. So, even a small saving can indeed 
make a signifi cant difference to total electricity 
scenario for Bhutan. The largest ferro alloy plant 
in Bhutan is the Bhutan Ferro Alloys Ltd (BFAL). 
However, a number of such units are expected 
to come up by 2008. It is recommended that 
energy-effi cient technologies be used extensively. 
Some technological and application-based 
recommendations are as follows.
Use of pre-heated (up to 950 °C) charge in a 
specially designed reactor (such as rotary kiln/
vertical shaft furnace) can bring down the specifi c 
power consumption to less than 3000 kWh. 
#Use of hot pre-reduced ore from the above 
reduction reactors (rotary kiln/vertical shaft 
furnace) integrated to smelting unit can bring 
about a drastic reduction in specifi c power 
consumption (around 2000 kWh).
Although it is possible to run the electric furnace 
with an MnO content of the slag as low as 15%–
16%, it would mean high slag basicity, high 
power consumption, and high fume losses.
For producing low phosphorus (less than 0.20%) 
ferro-manganese, calcium oxide/barium oxide 
(CaO/BaO)-based fl ux is recommended for the 
dephosphorization of liquid high carbon Fe–
Mn. But the melt will have to be desiliconized 
to less than 0.20% Si before dephosphorization. 
Injection of Ca–Si cored wire in the melt can 
reduce phosphorus in liquid ferro-manganese 
to less than 0.15%. Laboratory investigations 
have been completed for optimizing parameters 
such as composition of the reagent, amount to 
be added, effect of variation in silicon contents, 
treatment temperature, and treatment time. It 
is worth mentioning that for 0.10% decrease in 
phosphorus, the premium obtained is around 
Rs 500 per tonne of ferro-manganese.
The use of partially burnt coal (jhama) as a 
partial substitute to coke needs to be looked 
into and tried in actual practice, as it is expected 
to increase the charge resistance.
Annual energy auditing can be made compulsory, 
as it helps to identify the under/overutilization of 
machineries, leading to increased consumption 
of energy, particularly electricity.
Use of energy-effi cient technologies in new 
plants with soft loan/tax credit to cover part of 
additional expanses can be made mandatory.
Units violating the rated norms can be fi ned 
based on the degree of violations. Regular training 
programmes can also be made mandatory for plant 
offi cials, which will help them use energy effi ciently 
and also provide them with latest information on 
state-of-the-art technological developments. 
#

#
#
#
#
in the coming years. As mentioned earlier, the 
cement industry is an energy-intensive industry 
in which electricity and coal form major inputs 
to production. Process optimization, load 
management, and operational improvement can 
lead to signifi cant energy saving, and although it 
involves marginal fi nancial investment, it is found 
to have encouraging results in energy saving. These 
include the following.
Plugging of leakages in kiln and pre-heater 
circuit, raw mill, and coal mill circuits
Reducing idle running
Installing improved insulating bricks/blocks in 
kilns and pre-heaters
Utilizing hot exit gases in an effi cient manner
Optimizing cooler operation
Optimum loading of grinding media/grinding 
mill optimization
Rationalizing compressed air utilization
Redesigning of raw mix
Installing capacitor banks for power factor 
improvement
Replacing over-rated motors with optimally 
rated motors
Optimizing kiln operation
Changing from fl at belt to V-belt 
Use of energy-effi cient equipment gives very 
encouraging results even at the cost of some capital 
investment. The energy-effi cient equipment that 
can be used by the cement industry are highlighted 
below.
Slip power recovery system
Variable voltage and frequency drive
Grid rotor resistance
Soft starter for motors
High effi ciency fans
High effi ciency separators
Vertical roller mill
Pre-grinder/roller press
Low pressure pre-heater cyclones
Multi-channel burner
Bucket elevator in place of pneumatic 
conveying

#Active participation of employees in energy 
conservation efforts has been very fruitful in 
India (National Council for Cement and Building 
Materials). The suggestion box schemes, quality 
circles, brainstorming sessions, and cash rewards 
for good suggestions are some of the schemes the 
plants can adopt for ensuring active participation 
of employees. Setting up of an energy conservation 
cell for monitoring and controlling energy 
performance of the plant is gaining importance 
in the Indian plants. Cement units can also train 
manpower, as has been done in the Indian cement 
manufacturing companies. Industry audits should 
be made mandatory, and as mentioned earlier, 
there should be provisions for imposing fi nes for 
violations against non-compliance.
Iron and steel
A number of licensed industries are expected 
to come up in Bhutan. Iron and steel plants 
will constitute a signifi cant number, with some 
specializing in iron re-rolling, while others in the 
iron and steel making. The globalization of the 
steel industry has ushered in a new era of costcompetitiveness. The steel industry is the single 
largest energy consumer, accounting for about 4% 
of the world’s energy consumption. The energy 
used is a major cost factor for the steel industry. 
In developed countries, cost of energy is between 
15% and 20% of the overall cost of production. In 
India, it is between 30% and 33%, and for Bhutan, 
it is close to 40%. In the steel industry, the greatest 
saving in energy is achieved through improvement 
in technologies used for manufacturing iron and 
steel. In the current route, through direct reduced 
iron (DRI) to electric arc furnace (EAF), fi rst 
cold DRI/hot briquetted iron (HBI) is produced 
at ambient temperature, and this is then fed to EAF 
to produce steel. This involves loss of substantial 
energy due to multiple heating and cooling. So, 
there is a potential for saving energy by utilizing 
the energy technology and process of steel making. 
Various scrap pre-heating technologies are now 
available and have been designed to convey hot 
There are two primary benefi ts of hot charging of 
DRI to an EAF: (1) lower energy consumption 
for melting and (2) increased productivity due to 
shorter tap-to-tap time. The energy savings occur 
because less energy is required to bring DRI to 
melting temperature. As a thumb rule, power 
consumption can be reduced by about 20 kWh/
tonne of liquid steel for each 100% increase in the 
composite charge temperature. Also, in addition, 
there is saving in electrode consumption to the tune 
of 0.004 kg/kWh due to its linear relationship with 
power consumption. At 80% hot DRI charging, 
the savings in electrode work out to be Rs 50 per 
metric tonne (PMT) at current electrode prices. 
Some specifi c measures that can be adopted are 
as follows.
Effectively utilizing free space post combustion
Scrapping pre-heating system
Using hot runner and riser
Insulating pit for hot empty ladles
Converting spout tapping to submerged 
tapping
Using hot metal in EAF
Blowing lime fi res into EAF
Using supersonic oxygen blowing
Sliding gate system in EAF tap hole
Placing ladlehood in ladle furnace station
Continuous DRI/HBI charging
Post combustion system
Insulating pit for hot empty ladle
Modifying ladle cover and reduction in cover 
height
Using submerged tap hole
Using hot metal
Modifying ladle cover for online wire feeding
Changing mix optimization
Ladle in circulation
Using ladle pre-heating system
Using evacuating system
Using post-combustion technology
Using foamy slag practice
Using lime as fl ux
Measuring fi nished bath temperature
Using crucible and riser

#plants based on electric arc furnace and induction 
furnaces have reported signifi cant reduction in 
energy consumption. 
 The demand side management in industries 
is effectively done by adopting energy effi ciency 
measures and promoting energy-effi cient 
technologies. The energy audits carried out by 
TERI during the IEMMP project have shown that 
industries have the potential to save energy.
 Ferro-silicon plants in India have reported 
more effi cient performance than that reported 
by the Ferro-silicon Company in Bhutan. The 
advanced technologies can be introduced in new 
companies. 
 Awareness programme, along with support for 
energy audit, can be adopted as a strategy for 
the industrial sector. Similarly, industry-specifi c 
energy effi ciency measures can be suggested for 
most small- and medium-scale industries after 
energy audit. 
 Industries like wood and steel milling industries 
can be specifi cally targeted by conducting energy 
audit. Replacement of motors and use of energyeffi cient lighting are two major energy measures 
for these small units.
TRANSPORT SECTOR 
The transport sector in Bhutan comprises road and 
air transport. Bhutan’s transport sector contributed 
16% to the overall gross domestic product (GDP) 
at the end of the Eighth Five-year Plan (1997–
2001). The development strategy for the transport 
sector in Bhutan aims at achieving a number of 
milestones, as articulated in a comprehensive vision 
statement of Bhutan’s future (Bhutan 2020: A Vision 
of Peace, Prosperity and Happiness). These milestones 
include (1) 75% of rural population living within 
half-day’s walk from nearest road, (2) national 
trunk roads upgraded to take 30-tonne lorries, and 
(3) completing second transnational highway.
 The vision of Bhutan’s National Transport Policy 
is to ensure ‘access to quality transport services by 
all, taking into consideration the requirements of 
a landlocked country’.

Promoting regional cooperation in transport
‘Good Governance Plus’ recommends eco-friendly 
mass transport system in the major urban areas. 
 Petrol and diesel are the two fuels that are used 
in the transport sector in Bhutan. The country 
imports both these fuels, and over a period of time, 
there is an increasing trend in their consumption 
levels. Diesel imports were 51 460 kilolitres in 2005, 
of which a substantial proportion (about 49 197 
kilolitres) was used in the transport sector alone. 
The imports for petrol stood at 13 795 kilolitres 
in 2005, which was mainly used for transportation. 
At present, alternative fuels such as natural gas, 
electricity, and LPG are not used in Bhutan.
 Bhutan has no vehicle manufacturing facilities, 
and all vehicles are imported. Majority of vehicles 
are imported from India, Japan, and Korea. 
Import of vehicle is increasing as the economy is 
progressing. The number of different categories 
of motor vehicles imported in Bhutan in 2005 is 
given in Table 1.

#Current and anticipated issues in the transport 
sector of Bhutan
The options to improve energy effi ciency and 
reduce consumption of petroleum fuels in the 
transport sector can be classifi ed into following 
major categories.
Introducing effi cient mass transport and/or 
improving mass transport effi ciencies.
Improving energy effi ciency of petrol and diesel 
vehicles by making the latest European vehicle 
effi ciency norm compliance mandatory for the 
imported vehicles.
Introducing alternative fuel vehicles.
Designing transport system, including traffi c 
fl ow analysis, for reducing traffi c congestion.
Introducing alternative transport methods such 
as river navigation and rope ways.
Improving energy efficiency of petrol and 
diesel vehicles
Situational analysis
Bhutan imports vehicles from nearby countries. 
Majority of vehicles come from India, followed by 
Korea and Japan. Due to regulations in customs 
and major imports being through the state-owned 
State Trading Corporation of Bhutan and balance 
through the agents of major vehicle manufacturers 
like Maruti Motors in India and Hundai from 
Korea, Bhutan has so far not experienced dumping 
of old vehicles from nearby countries due to the 
prohibition imposed by the Royal Government of 
Bhutan (RGoB). This has prevented the use of old 
and ineffi cient vehicles in the country. However, 
in the future, import of even more effi cient motor 
vehicles should be encouraged.
 Engine exhaust emissions are also closely linked 
to the fuel effi ciency of the vehicles. Thus, use of 
effi cient vehicles is of paramount importance to 
keep the local air pollution levels low. Various fuel 
effi ciency norms are developed and adopted in India 
and other European countries. As a policy measure 
to promote the use of fuel-effi cient vehicles, the 
government could put in place mandatory strict 
vehicle emission control norms. These norms also 
#
#
#
#
#
for example 4WD Hi Lux or Scorpio, which 
need special high-octane petrol has also been 
accompanied by import of this fuel in the past 
few years. This is evident from the import fi gures 
of the past few years. 
 A separate Transport Sector Master Plan is 
being developed, which is essentially looking into 
the aspects of (1) emission reduction strategies, 
(2) traffi c density and traffi c fl ow analysis, and 
(3) suggestions on mass transport and alternative 
transport means like rope ways and river navigation 
for mountainous areas. The Transport Sector 
Master Plan study team has already identifi ed 
some strategies for the above aspects. However, it 
is advisable to study them from energy effi ciency 
point of view so that energy-effi cient technologies 
are selected. 
 For a place like Bhutan, which has very few 
industries and no thermal power plants, the 
transport sector contributes substantially to air 
pollution. As all major settlements are situated 
in valleys, local air pollution levels are bound to 
increase due to the extensive use of fossil fuels 
in the transport sector. The Transport Sector 
Master Plan is looking into the pollution levels 
and emission standards issues; hence, these are not 
considered exclusively in this study. 
Introduction of vehicles running on 
alternative fuel
Vehicles running on alternative fuels are becoming 
reality in many countries. Alternative fuels offer 
choice of fuels that contain less or practically 
zero pollutant. Examples of such fuels are CNG 
(compressed natural gas) and biofuels, which 
can be produced in an environment-friendly 
way by using carbon-neutral bioenergy. Vehicles 
running on electricity are also becoming popular. 
Futuristic options include hybrid vehicles that 
run on hydrogen and electricity. A range of fuel 
options are being evaluated for the transport sector 
worldwide (TERI 2005) and are discussed in the 
subsequent sections.cases, including public transport system of the 
Indian capital city of New Delhi. It is a safe, 
clean burning, and environment-friendly fuel. It 
has been established that exhaust emissions like 
hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide are signifi cantly 
reduced when CNG is used as compared to other 
fuels. Toxic emissions of lead and sulphur are 
completely eliminated. Existing petrol vehicles can 
use CNG by fi tting a conversion kit. The CNGconverted vehicles have the fl exibility of operating 
either on petrol or on CNG. Recently, major 
vehicle manufacturers in India have introduced 
CNG vehicles in the Indian market. However, 
in Bhutan, lack of infrastructure and limited 
availability of CNG are major barriers in the use 
of CNG in the transport sector. However, under 
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation 
(SAARC) initiative, Bhutan can look into the 
possibility of getting CNG for the transport 
sector and industries, at least in the border areas 
of Bhutan. Techno-fi nancial feasibility studies are 
required for this purpose, which can be taken 
up in the Tenth Plan period. Investments in the 
development of infrastructure for CNG transport 
and handling would be a critical issue, considering 
the number of vehicles in the countries and their 
distribution. 
Liquefied petroleum gas
LPG is deemed to be superior to petrol and diesel 
in terms of vehicular emissions. To abate pollution 
caused by vehicles, a number of countries have 
been using LPG as auto fuel. 
 Typically, the exhaust emissions of vehicles 
running on LPG comprise
75% less carbon monoxide,
85% less hydrocarbons,
40% less nitrous oxide, and
result in 87% less ozone depletion. 
as compared to vehicles running on petrol.
Recommendations
Currently, Bhutan imports LPG from India, 
and under the bilateral arrangement, the LPG is 
#
#
#
#
for transport applications could be discussed 
in bilateral meetings with India. This may have 
impact on trade balance. A study to compare the 
pros and cons of using LPG for other applications 
in general and for the transport sector in particular 
is required, as other issues like infrastructure for 
distribution, and market segments and their share 
in LPG demand are also important and need to 
be studied in detail. A joint study between Bhutan 
and India can be taken up in the Tenth Plan. 
Biofuels 
Biofuels are the fuels derived from biomass, that 
is, recently living organisms or their metabolic byproducts. Ethanol, methanol, and bio-diesel are 
important biofuels that can be used for vehicular 
applications. 
Ethanol and methanol
Mixing of ethanol and methanol in petrol and 
diesel, up to 10%, is possible for use in conventional 
petrol and diesel engines without any modifi cation. 
Ethanol and methanol are generally produced as 
by-products in sugar and other industries. Bhutan 
currently has no industries producing ethanol or 
methanol. 
Bio-diesel
Bio-diesel is produced by processing vegetable 
oil. This process, called as esterifi cation, converts 
vegetable oil to a diesel-like fuel having properties 
similar to diesel. The interest in bio-diesel is 
increasing worldwide since 2000. The US and the 
European countries are using soybean, rapeseed, 
and other edible oils for producing bio-diesel. In 
India, bio-diesel production using locally available 
species of non-edible oil-bearing plant seeds such 
as jatropha and pongamia is preferred. In Bhutan, 
locally available oil-bearing plants can be studied, 
and indigenous development of bio-diesel can be 
taken up as a joint research project with the Indian 
institutes under the aegis of the Department of 
Science and Technology (DST). This would be a 
medium-term (fi ve to seven years) strategy, which 
can be initiated in the Tenth Plan. use of electric/hybrid vehicles for personal transport 
are viable options for Bhutan in medium term. 
 Hybrid (petrol–electric) and electric vehicles are 
now being developed by many major automobile 
manufacturers worldwide. Currently, vehicles 
are imported from India, Japan, Korea, and 
China. Automobile companies in these countries, 
especially in India and Japan, have already 
fl ooded the market with electric vehicles. Major 
automobile manufacturers like M/s Mahindra and 
Mahindra and M/s Bajaj Auto Ltd from India 
are already testing electric three-wheelers (sixseater vehicles) in Indian markets. These vehicles 
can be introduced in Bhutan on demonstration 
basis for public transport in cities like Thimphu 
and Phuentsholing. A note on the experience of 
implementing electric vehicles as public transport 
is given in Box 2. Market for electric cars like REVA 
can also be explored, especially in fl at terrain areas 
in southern Bhutan.
 Electric minibuses are being introduced by many 
Indian automobile manufacturers like Mahindra 
and Mahindra and others. 
 Minibuses and three-wheelers running on 
electricity can be promoted in small urban 
areas and in major town areas like Thimphu. 
The DoE and the Ministry of Information and 
Communications (MoIC) can undertake a joint 
project, which can also be submitted as a Clean 
Development Mechanism (CDM) project.
Recommendations on improving energy 
efficiency of petrol and diesel vehicles
Technological innovations are increasingly gaining 
importance in the transport sector. The average 
buses is around 3 km per litre. These fi gures do 
not refl ect the state-of-the-art technology but point 
to the fact that due to lower power requirement 
and small size, coupled with advanced technology, 
considerable improvements are possible in vehicles. 
The fuel economy based on typical vehicles likely 
to be operated in India through 2020 is given in 
Table 2. These could be considered for Bhutan as 
well, as most of the vehicles are imported from 
India.
Table 2

BE OPERATED IN INDIA

Diesel car 20.0 21.3
Diesel bus 3.27 3.36
Note Fuel consumption estimates are based on the study by Bose 
and Nesamani (2000) 
Diesel vehicles have better fuel economy than the 
gasoline ones, as diesel engines are more effi cient 
and diesel fuel contains more energy per litre. 
However, emissions from diesel vehicles are a 
serious problem.
 The sulphur in diesel has considerable potential 
to pollute the air and adversely affect human 
health, causing respiratory disorders due to the 
BOX 2
NEPAL’S EXPERIENCE WITH ELEC TRIC VEHICLE 
To tackle the problem of air pollution in Kathmandu valley, Nepal started using electric vehicles in 1997. These 
were known as Safa tempos. About 600 of these tempos were introduced. Subsequently, a major project was 
initiated by ‘Kathmandu Electric Vehicle Alliance (KEVA)’ to improve the operational effi ciency of these tempos. 
 KEVA is a joint programme undertaken by an NGO (non-governmental organization), government, and private 
sector to improve the air quality of the Kathmandu valley. Details of the project are available at <http://www.
cleanairnet.org/caiasia/1412/articles-60355_project.pdf>.normal proportion of 1% by weight, or ultra low 
sulphur diesel, that is, diesel containing 0.25% 
sulphur, is used in many countries. The Ministry 
of Economic Affairs can consider making ultra 
low sulphur diesel mandatory in phased manner 
in Bhutan.
AGRICULTURE SECTOR
Energy needs of the agriculture sector vary at 
different stages, as shown in Figure 4. 
 Currently, energy consumption in farming is 
very low, mainly due to the mountainous nature 
of the terrain, small farm size, and low investment 
in farming.
 However, modern energy based interventions to 
improve farm productivity and labour effi ciency, 
thereby reducing the requirement of human labour 
jointly by the DoE and Ministry of Agriculture 
(MoA). 
 Various studies conducted and data generated 
show that the diesel-powered multi-utility power 
tillers are the most useful and, hence, sought-after 
farm equipment in Bhutan. These are currently 
subsidized under Japanese funds. The RGoB 
can consider providing further support for this 
programme to improve the availability of such 
power tillers. Some applications for the agriculture 
sector, which can help reduce the overall energy 
demand or import of energy, are discussed 
subsequently.
FIGURE 4 ENERGY INPUTS IN THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR IN BHUTANThe agriculture sector generates biomass residue 
as a farm product waste, along with other wastes 
like animal dung. Biogas plants may be developed 
at these farm sites, and the gas produced can 
be used for pumping water, space heating, and 
food processing applications. The DoE can take 
initiatives in the implementation of these plants 
by creating awareness and providing subsidy 
schemes.
Diesel-powered power tillers
Diesel-powered power tillers are currently provided 
by the MoA through Japanese government’s aided 
scheme on subsidy. These power tillers are multipurpose and are quite popular among farmers as 
is evident from the fact that there is a waiting list 
for procuring these tillers. These tillers are driven 
by diesel and their faster penetration would lead 
to improved farm productivity. 
Small wind-operated pump sets
Bhutan’s agriculture sector represented by dry land 
farming, which depends on rainwater. Because the 
terrain is mountainous, It is diffi cult to dig canals 
and pump water. In windy areas, small mechanical 
wind pumps or small wind electric generator 
powered pump sets can be installed. These would 
be site-specifi c applications. The DoE can initiate 
a demonstration programme on these lines. 
Energy-efficient pump sets
Although water pump sets are not used extensively 
in the agriculture sector in Bhutan when compared 
with other countries, energy-effi cient pump sets 
can be promoted through labelling scheme, which 
is proposed for all electrical appliances. 
Solar-powered pesticide sprayers and solar 
fencing
Solar-powered pesticide sprayers are handy 
equipment, which run on solar-powered packs. 
These would be useful for farmers as they are light 
weight and easy to operate. 
 It is recommended that the MoA and DoE 
introduce them under jointly funded subsidy/
Mechanization/cold storage facilities/ice 
production facilities
Refrigerated/ice cooled trailers for power 
tiller/ refrigerated vehicles
Loss of agriculture produce in transit between 
farms and marketplace is common in Bhutan due 
to diffi cult terrain and lack of farm roads in most 
parts of the country. This loss can be reduced by 
developing small movable refrigeration/ice storage 
systems, which can store farm produce in cold 
storage till they are delivered. Special research and 
development project can be taken up jointly by 
research organizations in India, such as TERI, in 
collaboration with the DoE and MoA. This would 
prove to be a very useful strategy in long term. 
Promotion of gasifier for cardamom drying 
Cardamom is one of the most important agriculture 
products in Bhutan, which requires drying. To 
use the locally available biomass resources for the 
drying purpose, biomass gasifi ers can be used for 
drying. Initially, the DoE may install a gasifi er 
under a demonstration project and then promote 
the installation of these gasifi ers by undertaking 
awareness campaign and providing subsidy to 
farmers.
Overall implementation strategy for the 
demand side management
The precise time schedule for the implementation 
of the strategies suggested above are given in Table 
3, and the results of the impact assessment of the 
proposed strategies are given in Table 4.
ESTIMATED BUDGET FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION 
OF DIFFERENT STRATEGIES RECOMMENDED FOR 
DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT OF ENERGY
A budget has been estimated for different strategies,

the plan related to the demand side management 
of energy and is given in Table 5. This budget head

in Bhutan. While some of these cross 
linkages are quite obvious, a few are not that 
apparent. The following sections attempt to put 
these critical issues in the right perspective. 
ENERGY SECURITY
The concept of energy security has witnessed a 
paradigm change. Historically, energy security 
focused primarily on concerns on oil disruption 
in the oil-producing world. This concern has not 
been addressed till now. In fact, many other related 
concerns have emerged now. Concerns over energy 
security are not limited to oil alone; reliability 
of electricity supply systems has become an 
important issue, given the chronic power shortages 
in developing countries and incidents of blackouts 
in the developed world. Sophisticated integration 
of energy systems also means that a break at any 
point in the supply chain can reverberate through 
the entire system. Moreover, it must be recognized 
that energy security is not a stand-alone entity. 
It assumes a larger dimension among countries. 
At the same time, a new range of vulnerabilities 
has become more evident—energy systems are 
at unprecedented risk from political turmoil, 
terrorism, and the impacts of climate change. 
 Bhutan is already confronting some of these 
issues. The country has no known reserves of fossil 
fuels and has no option but to import oil to satisfy 
its growing needs. 
 While hydropower is available in plenty to meet 
the country’s needs, there are concerns about the 
shortage of electricity in the lean season, especially 
development, and environment 
to meet the needs of a growing industry. Bhutan’s 
energy system is also particularly vulnerable to the 
impacts of climate change, given that water fl ows 
are likely to be affected due to global warming 
in future (ICIMOD 2005). Apart from this, other 
climate change adaptation issues may emerge over 
the period. The issue of adaptation to climate 
change is discussed later in this chapter. 
 For a developing country like Bhutan that has 
a mountainous terrain, energy security also needs 
to be looked at from a micro perspective—are 
the remotest regions and the poorest assured of 
secure and affordable energy? The basic nature of 
energy would imply that the energy for essential 
household needs should be given preference when 
energy is available in limited quantity. Although 
policy directives are clear on this front, this also 
necessitates that decentralized or non-conventional 
source of energy be tapped not just to minimize 
import dependence but also to provide energy 
where conventional supply networks cannot 
reach. 
 Following points refl ect some of the countryspecifi c energy security concerns in Bhutan.
Plugging electricity demand–supply gap during 
lean period.
High dependence on hydropower, with 
hydropower accounting for more than 99% of 
the electricity generated. Furthermore, country’s 
two major power plants, namely, Chukha and 
Tala hydropower plants, are responsible for the 
majority of electricity generation.
Vulnerability of power generation to water 
supply due to the impact of climate change.

#While maintaining the security of supply at 
the macro and micro levels by investing in 
infrastructure and diversifi cation of the energy 
portfolio, another important aspect of energy 
security is reducing energy consumption by 
improving energy effi ciency. This has increasingly 
become a feasible alternative today due to the 
advancement of technology and the possibility of 
international technology transfers. In most cases, 
the best near-term option for increasing energy 
security is through energy effi ciency. These options 
are covered extensively in the earlier chapters. 
ENERGY FOR POVERTY REDUCTION AND 
BALANCED REGIONAL GROWTH
It is now well established that income (or the lack 
of it) is only one aspect of poverty. In a wider sense, 
poverty is deprivation, which may be traced to fi ve 
inter-related clusters of disadvantages: physical 
weakness (lack of strength, under-nutrition, ill 
health, disability, high ratio of dependents to 
active adults); isolation (physical remoteness, 
ignorance, and lack of access to information or 
knowledge); income poverty (lack of income 
and wealth); vulnerability (increased exposure 
to contingencies, and danger of becoming more 
deprived); and powerlessness (inability to cope, 
adapt, and choose) (Chambers 1989).
 Energy can play a fundamental role in minimizing 
each of these disadvantages, as shown in Figure 1. 
 While issues related to electricity export and 
optimizing the use of electricity for the promotion 
of domestic industry have been dealt with before, 
this section discusses the importance of energy 
systems and options to be planned so as to promote 
regionally balanced development. 
 A quick look at the economic and social 
indicators for Bhutan shows the presence of 
well as between rural and urban areas. Almost 
70% of the Bhutan’s population, comprising 
634 982 people (Census of Bhutan 2005), resides 
in rural areas. Not surprisingly, poverty in Bhutan 
is largely a rural phenomenon as the data of the 
Bhutan Living Standards Survey 2003 noted that 
about 40% of the rural population was poor, while 
less than 5% of the urban population was poor.1
Likewise, the poverty gap and poverty severity 
indices showed that poverty was deeply entrenched 
and more severe in rural areas as compared to 
urban areas.2
 The regional disparity is also evident in the 
spread of the electricity network in the country, 
as discussed in Chapter 4. These disparities are 
refl ected in the tendency of most immigrants to 
move towards the western part of the country. 
Migration to towns in the western region is almost 
double of that in the eastern region.
 This divide would need to be tackled using a 
two-pronged approach—on the one hand, there 
is a need to plan more townships, particularly in 
the eastern part of the country, on the other, the 
‘push factor’ from rural areas needs to be arrested 
through concerted efforts at rural development. 
The importance of rural development in poverty 
reduction is evident from the fact that it has been 
identifi ed, together with the promotion of balanced 
regional development, private sector development, 
and infrastructure development as the main 
objectives in the Tenth Five-year Plan guidelines. 
The next section describes the challenges facing 
rural economic development in Bhutan and 
expounds how energy services can address them. 
Challenges in rural development
About 66% of the Bhutanese workforce is engaged 
in agriculture and forestry (Statistical Yearbook of 
Bhutan 2005).3
 Farming in Bhutan is a challenge 
1
 The poor include households with real consumption less than the poverty line.
2
 The Poverty Gap Index measures the intensity of poverty for the population—it refl ects the difference between the poverty line and 
actual expenditure. The Poverty Severity Index is calculated as the weighted sum of poverty gaps (as a proportion of the poverty line), 
with weight proportionate to poverty gaps. 3
 The main cereals growing in Bhutan are rice, maize, wheat, barley, buckwheat, and millet. Cash crops include oranges, potatoes, apples, 
plums, walnuts, and vegetables. Cereal cultivation is, however, dominated by maize and rice.FIGURE 1 ENERGY SERVICES CONTRIBUTE TO BREAKING THE DEPRIVATION TRAP
because of low soil fertility, poor infrastructure, 
small landholding size, occurrence of natural 
disasters like fl oods, and the mountainous terrain, 
all of which make the activity labour-intensive. 
The majority of the farming households own less 
than 3 acres of land (RNR Statistics 2000), which 
can only provide subsistence living, as is evident 
from the fact that less than 5% of the domestic 
rice production in the country in 2002 (38 000 
tonnes) was marketed. Some 54 000 tonnes of 
rice was imported to meet domestic demand. 
Studies suggest that in many villages, up to 50% 
of the households are often food insecure, while 
seasonally, this fi gure may go up to 75%. Box 1 
presents constraints encountered in food grain 
production. 
 Livestock rearing is an integral part of the 
farming system in the country. Close to 95% of 
the rural households own an average of fi ve to 
nine cattle, which primarily serve as a source of 
draught power and manure for their fi elds and 
dairy products for household uses. However, 
the potential of livestock in contributing to farm 
income is constrained by the lack of adequate feed 
and fodder and poor health services. 
 Inadequate return from agriculture is fuelling 
migration from rural to urban areas. The resulting 
decline in the availability of labour further affects 
the productivity of the sector, which has historically 
been labour-intensive. The infl ux of migrants is 
restricted to a few urban centres. Some estimates 
suggest that at 10% rate of growth of population, Thimphu is growing at a rate, which is more than 
three times the national rate, with Phuentsholing 
only slightly behind. At this rate, close to half of 
Bhutan’s population will be living in urban areas 
within the next 20–25 years (Vision 2020). The rate 
of urbanization is a concern for several reasons. 
Given the topography of the country, the land 
required to accommodate the growing urban 
population is limited. The general absence of 
fl at land for population could result in the 
settlement at steeper valley slopes, which should 
be best left for vegetation cover. Apart from 
enhancing deforestation, this could also add to 
the risks of erosion, disruption of watercourses, 
and the possibility of fl ooding and landslides 
during monsoons.
Towns are poorly equipped to deal with a rapid 
infl ux of migrants, as urban infrastructure and 
#
#
services, including land legislation and land 
markets, are not well developed. 
Employment opportunities in urban areas will 
not be enough for a growing urban population, 
which could result in social and political 
instability in the country (see Box 2). 
There is a need to restrict migration by creating 
viable opportunities in rural areas, which would 
allow the poor to participate in the market 
economy and improve their livelihoods. Given 
the intrinsic constraints faced by the agriculture 
sector in Bhutan, the key to rural development 
will be agricultural diversifi cation and promotion 
of small-scale and cottage industries in rural areas, 
with an emphasis on high-value niche markets. This 
will also catalyse more dispersed and regionally 
balanced growth and employment compared to 
#

CONSTRAINTS IN FOOD GRAIN PRODUCTION
According to a survey carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture, Royal Government of Bhutan, the main 
constraints faced by the farming households in food grain production include destruction by wild animals (54% 
of the respondents saw this as a major concern), lack of irrigation (28%), labour shortage (20%), and small size 
of landholding (13%). Destruction by pests and diseases (13%) and limited access to markets (10%) also aff ect 
food grain production
Source RNR Statistics (2000) BOX 2
RURAL–URBAN MIGRATION: DRIVERS AND FALLOUT
The fi rst labour force survey held in 1998 found that 76% of the labour force was employed in the agriculture 
sector.After that, employment in the Renewable and Natural Resources (RNR) sector decreased to about 66% in 
2004. Over 81% of the unemployed in Bhutan live in rural areas. A study on rural–urban migration, carried out 
by the Ministry of Agriculture, found that 47% of all households comprised migrants. While lack of educational 
facilities was the reason behind migration of 46% of the people, 19% left their villages due to small landholdings, 
drudgery of farm work, unproductive agriculture, crop damages by wild animals, and natural calamities.
 The demographic transition in the country will mean that the growth in the demand for jobs will far exceed 
the rate of population growth. Vision 2020 for Bhutan notes that by 2020, a total of 267 000 jobs will need to be 
created even under the most favourable demographic scenario. The number of job seekers will be considerably 
higher if one factors in those who chose to leave the RNR sector and migrate to urban areas and those who 
are displaced as a result of mechanization or improvements in labour productivity in the agriculture and other 
sectors.
 On the other hand, the gross domestic product (GDP) growth in Bhutan in the last decade or so has been 
driven by hydropower, construction, service, and power-intensive manufacturing sectors, which have relatively 
low employment elasticity. The Bhutanese have a preference for public sector jobs; however, given the emphasis 
on the formation of a compact, professional, and effi cient organization, future opportunities in the government 
will also be limited.importance of industry and services in rural areas 
is evident from the fact that in rural areas, a greater 
proportion of the non-poor work in these sectors 
compared to the poor (Table 1).

 Though small- and cottage-scale fi rms comprise 
about 40% of the industrial units in Bhutan (Figure 
2), the sector is dominated by micro-enterprises 
(largely comprising small family-run business such 
as restaurants, tea stalls, and rice mills) that have 
limited scope for expansion.
 The Royal Government of Bhutan (RGoB) is 
following a ‘triple gem approach’ for agricultural 
development and diversifi cation by increasing 
productivity, accessibility, and marketing in 
order to achieve national food security, raise cash 
incomes and employment opportunities in rural 
areas, generate export revenue, and achieve an 
improvement in the nutritional status of the rural 
population while conserving and managing natural 
improved crop varieties and complementary 
inputs. 
Exploiting the regional and seasonal comparative 
advantages that Bhutan has in the cultivation 
of both temperate and sub-temperate fruits 
and vegetables. In 2004, exports of oranges 
constituted about 3.4% of the total value of top 
10 exports from Bhutan (Statistical Yearbook 
of Bhutan 2005). The government aims at 
increasing the value of horticultural exports by 
200% by 2007 and by 300% by 2012 (Vision 
2020). 
Diversifying the rural economic base by 
encouraging other high-value, low-value, and 
off-season produce, such as medicinal and 
aromatic plants, and fl oriculture. 
Developing small and cottage industries in rural 
areas with an emphasis on creating productive 
employment rather than capturing export 
markets. 
Promoting animal health services, feed and 
fodder production, and animal breeding services, 
given that livestock represent an important asset, 
especially for the marginal farmers. Further, 
development of backyard livestock farms can 
also bring down imports of animal products 
like cheese and meat. 
The realization of these objectives calls for urgent 
and signifi cant expansion of rural infrastructure, 
including farm mechanization, irrigation, roads, 
cold storage facilities, and access of small-scale 
producers to technology, credit, and markets. Left 
to market mechanisms, the focus on the growth 
of urban and large industry will continue for 
reasons related to economies of scale, profi tability, 
and access to infrastructure, markets, credit, and 
technology.
 Energy will be a key input in the government’s 
efforts towards rural development and reducing 
the rates of rural–urban migration. The Vision 
Statement clearly brings out the importance of 
roads and electricity in bringing the communities 
out of their isolation, increasing access to markets

FIGURE 2 DISTRIBUTION OF INDUSTRY, BY SIZE (%)Energy for rural development
Energy is a key ingredient for rural development, 
whether it is for agricultural growth and 
diversifi cation, for the promotion of rural industry 
or for augmenting the provision of basic education 
and health care services.
 Energy constitutes a key direct and indirect 
input into agriculture. Direct energy needs include 
energy required for land preparation, cultivation, 
irrigation, harvesting, post-harvest processing, 
food production, storage, and the transport of 
agricultural inputs and outputs. Indirect energy 
needs are in the form of sequestered energy in 
fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, and insecticides. 
Modern energy consumption can also be expected 
to increase agricultural productivity and food 
security.4
 Agriculture in Bhutan continues to be based, 
to a large extent, on animal and human energy. 
Commercial energy use in agriculture is limited 
(Bhutan Energy Data Directory 2005). While the 
input supply system in Bhutan is subsidized and 
access is universal, its benefi ts are constrained 
by the lack of proper storage facilities, transport, 
and access roads, the development of all of 
which is dependent on energy infrastructure in 
rural areas. For example, horticulture products 
require a temperature-controlled atmosphere for 
transportation between the farm and the end 
market, and storage. Again, irrigation systems in the 
country, largely dependent on the monsoons, are 
usually small, being typically less than 100 hectares 
in extent, and are gravity-fed from streams. The 
development of engineered irrigation, especially 
for horticulture, will also need energy inputs as is 
true for livestock health services. Small-scale rural 
industry can also benefi t from augmented energy 
infrastructure in rural areas. 
environment are the main principles of the 
development philosophy in Bhutan. This is not 
only important in itself but also closely linked to 
both economic growth of the country (given the 
economic importance of hydropower and tourism) 
and poverty reduction (given the dependence 
of communities on forests for food, medicines, 
energy, fodder, organic fertilizers, and so on). 
Environmental sustainability would, therefore, be 
a key criterion in the policy-making across sectors. 
From the point of view of the energy sector, 
important environmental issues include possible 
diversion of forest land towards constructing 
energy infrastructure, ecological impacts of large 
hydro projects, more so in the case of storage 
projects that are likely to come up in future, and 
the potential impacts of climate change on the 
energy sector of Bhutan. Subsequent sections 
discuss these aspects in detail. 
Impacts of energy infrastructure on forest area 
and ecology
Conservation of forests and biodiversity is a 
central tenet in Bhutan’s development endeavour. 
The Department of Forests (now known as the 
Department of Forestry Services) was, interestingly, 
the fi rst government department to be instituted in 
1952, with the objective to harvest timber, the most 
visible natural resource at the time. The principle of 
conservation against exploitation began as early as 
1969 when the Bhutan Forest Act was enacted. The 
Act brought all forest resources under state control 
with the intent to curb exploitation and rationalize 
usage. Subsequently, a number of legislations have 
been enacted to protect the forests of the country. 
Box 3 gives a chronology of conservation legislation 
and initiatives in Bhutan.
 Bhutan currently has about 72% of its total area 
under forest, including about 25% area declared 
4
 Analysis at a broad regional level suggests a correlation between high per capita modern energy consumption and food production. 
While regional data may conceal many differences between countries, crop types, and urban and rural areas, the correlation is strong 
in developing countries, where high inputs of modern energy can be assumed to have a positive impact on agricultural output and
food production levels. The correlation is less strong in industrialized countries, where food production is near or above required levels, 
and changes in production level may refl ect changes in diet and food rather than any advantages gained from an increased supply of 
modern energy. in the country face extreme pressure in terms of 
meeting the needs of the population (for timber, 
fuelwood, fodder, medicinal and aromatic plants, 
pastures, organic manure, bamboo and cane for 
handicrafts and household implements, and pulp 
for traditional paper making) as well as commercial 
areas but are restricted and subject to a clearance 
from the government. The Environmental 
Assessment Act, 2002, establishes procedures for 
the assessment of the potential effects of strategic 
plans, policies, programmes, and projects on the 
environment and for the determination of policies 
5
 At present, two defi nitions exist for the calculation of forest cover in Bhutan. The legal defi nition in the Forest and Nature Conservation 
Act defi nes forest as ‘any land and waterbody, whether or not under vegetative cover, in which no person has acquired a permanent or 
transferable right of use and occupancy, whether such land is located inside or outside the forest boundary pillars, and includes land 
registered in a person’s name as grazing land or woodlot for collection of leaf litter’. While the international defi nition of forests includes 
only forest proper and scrub forest, the legal defi nition includes woodlot for collection of leaf litter, pastureland, and waterbodies. 
It is noted that the Ministry of Agriculture uses both these defi nitions in different contexts—for prevention of encroachments and 
management of forest area, the legal defi nition is used, whereas for resource assessment, the international defi nition is adopted. BOX 3
CHRONOLOGY OF CONSERVATION LEGISLATION AND INITIATIVES 
IN BHUTAN
The Department of Forests (now known as the Department of Forestry Services) was the very fi rst government 
department to be instituted in 1952. The objective was to harvest timber, the most visible natural resource at the 
time. The principle of conservation against exploitation was introduced as early as 1969 when the Bhutan Forest 
Act was enacted. The Act brought all forest resources under state control, with the intent to curb exploitation 
and rationalize usage. As the forerunner of all modern legislation, it also refl ected the importance attached by 
the government to the conservation of forests. This was further consolidated in 1974 with the formulation of the 
National Forest Policy, the nationalization of logging operations in 1979, and the establishment of a network of 
protected areas in 1983. 
 A ban on the exports of wood logs was imposed in 1973, which aff ected the cutting of forests in Bhutan for 
commercial exploitation.
 The Bhutan Trust Fund (BTF) for Environmental Conservation was created in 1991 under the Royal Charter 
as an independent mechanism to sustain fi nancing for environmental conservation, primarily in protected 
areas. The national protected areas system was revised again in 1993 to make it more representative of the 
various major ecosystems in the country. In 1995, the Forest and Nature Conservation Act, or FNCA, was ratifi ed, 
repealing the Bhutan Forest Act, 1969. The aim of the FNCA was to address evolving conservation needs, 
including community participation and protected area management. In the same year, Bhutan ratifi ed two major 
international conventions related to environmental conservation—the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) 
and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In keeping with the requirements 
of the CBD, the country produced its fi rst Biodiversity Action Plan in 1998 and, subsequently, updated it in 2002 
to refl ect progress and new conservation needs. A network of biological corridors linked the national protected 
areas system in 1999, enlarging the system from 26% to 35% of the country’s total geographical area. In November 
1999, the biological corridors were bequeathed as a ‘Gift to the Earth’ from the people of Bhutan. 
 The Environmental Assessment Act was passed by the National Assembly in 2000 and the Regulation for 
Environmental Clearance of Projects and the Regulation on Strategic Environmental Assessment came into 
eff ect in 2002. The Environmental Assessment Act, 2000, entered into force on 14 July 2000. The Regulation for 
Environmental Clearance of Projects and the Regulation on Strategic Environmental Assessment came into eff ect 
on 4 April 2002. Many conservation milestones were charted as Bhutan passed the National Biodiversity Act, 
2003, and acceded to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) of Wild Fauna and 
Flora and the UN Convention on Combating Desertifi cation (UNCCD) in 2003.
Source Department of Forestry Services, Ministry of Agriculture. 2004; National Environment Commission website 
<http://www.nec.gov.bt/> for the Environmental Clearance of Projects and 
Regulation of Strategic Environmental Assessment 
was adopted in 2002. The National Environment 
Commission (NEC) has issued guidelines for a 
number of sectors, including hydropower, and 
transmission lines to assist project proponents 
through the process of acquiring an environmental 
clearance for their project. 
 The main requirements under the 
Environmental Assessment Act in the context 
of hydropower projects are summarized in Box 
4. While these cover the major impacts that are 
likely to arise, it is suggested that in view of the 
possible increase in the diversion of forest areas 
for the creation of large generation capacity 
(especially if storage projects are also built in the 
future) and transmission infrastructure, a policy 
of compensatory afforestation be introduced once 
the project meets all the requirements of the 
Environmental Assessment Act. 
 In India, for instance, compensatory afforestation 
is one of the most important conditions stipulated 
by the central government at the behest of the 
Supreme Court. This fi nancial mechanism 
mandates providing a comprehensive scheme, 
including the details of non-forest/degraded forest 
area identifi ed for compensatory afforestation, 
certifi cate from afforestation/management point 
of view, along with the cost structure of various 
operations while seeking approval for proposals of 
dereservation or diversion of forest land for nonforest uses. There are two basic ways in which 
compensatory afforestation has been envisaged in 
India. 
1 Afforestation to be carried out over an area 
equivalent to the diverted forest land. This land 
should be close to reserved forest or protected 
forest so as to enable the forest department to 
effectively manage the newly planted area.
2 Compensatory afforestation may be done 
on the degraded forest land the extent of 
which is twice that of the forest area that 
is being diverted/dereserved. The identifi ed 
non-forest land is claimed by the state forest 
department and declared as protected forests 
so that the plantation raised can be maintained 
permanently. 
It is further suggested that forests that are managed 
and valued primarily for their ecological values (as 
against timber and non-timber forest products) 
be classifi ed as conservation forests, with more 
severe restriction on diversion compared to other 
forests.

is left untouched for the regeneration of forest 
naturally. This policy is followed to retain the 
composition and nature of natural forest. Plantation 
of outside species is not encouraged. However, in 
rural areas that are close to settlements, community 
social forestry is now being encouraged. June 2 
is celebrated as ‘Social Forestry Day’ every year, 
which encourages afforestation.
 Transmission network needs large area of land 
to establish the network, and efforts are needed 
to keep it safe from forest fi res. Mainly the land 
around the tower is cleared, and once electrical 
lines are installed, green cover is regenerated in 
most of the area. Pruning and cutting are done to 
maintain the clarity and visibility between the trees 
and transmission lines. 
 Forests are also important to maintain the 
watershed areas and reduce the erosion of land, 
which ultimately affects the silting of hydropower 
plants and river basins.
Potential impacts of changing climatic 
conditions on the energy sector
Despite Bhutan being a low contributor to the 
global emissions, climate change is likely to have 
adverse impacts on the country, spanning all 
sectors of the economy and impacting livelihoods 
and well-being at large. Several studies project the 
impacts of climate change to be severe in fragile 
ecosystems such as mountainous regions. As a least 
developed country situated in a mountain ecosystem 
and owing to its limited coping capacity, Bhutan 
is doubly vulnerable to possible climate change 
are annual occurrences, which cause signifi cant 
losses to lives and damage to property.6
 IPCC 
(2007) reiterates that settlements in mountain 
regions are at enhanced risk to glacial lake outburst 
fl oods, or GLOFs, caused by melting glaciers. A 
note on climate extreme events is given in Box 5.
 The most likely climatic events in Bhutan 
are increased GLOF events and fl ooding. Also, 
increased precipitation in areas without proper 
drainage systems can cause soil instabilities and, 
consequently, landslides and fl ash fl oods. The fi rst 
National Communication (NATCOM) of Bhutan 
identifi es six key areas vulnerable to climate change. 
These include forests and biodiversity, agriculture, 
water resources, GLOFs, health, and landslides. 
 The agriculture and hydropower sectors are the 
most vulnerable owing to their innate dependency 
on the monsoon and temperature patterns. As more 
than 70% of the Bhutanese population depends 
on subsistence farming, crop failure and stress on 
livestock rearing will affect the most vulnerable 
communities in the rural areas. Uncertainty 
associated with the timing of monsoons adds to 
the vulnerability of the farming community. The 
main cash crops grown by farmers (rice, potatoes, 
chillies, apples, and oranges) are extremely sensitive 
to water and temperature variations (NEC 2006). 
The presence of mountainous topography and 
scattered settlements implies high costs for social 
services and development of infrastructure, which 
add to the climate vulnerability of the country.

NOTABLE CLIMATE EXTREME EVENTS IN BHUTAN 
• The October 1994 fl ash fl ood on the Pho Chhu river, following a glacial lake outburst in the Lunana area, 
seriously damaged the lower valleys of Punakha.
• A rare dry spell with no snowfall occurred in the winter of 1998, and even rarer mid-summer snowfall occurred 
in some places in the north in July 1999. 
• Flash fl oods in early August 2000 caused by torrential rains had large-scale impacts on life and property.Changes in the climate system have both direct and 
indirect implications on the hydrological regime. 
An increase in rainfall intensity may increase runoff and rates of soil erosion on cleared land and 
may also accelerate sedimentation in the existing 
water supply network or reservoirs. 
 Increase in temperature will result in the 
retreat of glaciers, increasing the volume of lakes, 
ultimately leading to GLOFs. Possible impacts 
of GLOFs in Bhutan include disruption of river 
fl ows and changes in sediment yield, thereby 
impacting hydropower generation and water 
supply; destructing settlements, infrastructure, 
and agricultural land; and leading to the loss of 
biodiversity, apart from other impacts on human 
lives downstream.

targeted on the most severe effects and the greatest 
vulnerabilities to climate change. Investments 
in such options essentially present ‘win-win’ 
solutions, since they have ancillary benefi ts, apart 
from avoiding direct climate-related costs. Some 
adaptation measures suggested for the country to 
address various hazards are listed in Table 2. 
 These measures will require the development of 
information and research systems to better monitor 
and understand the impacts of climate change 
as well as assess signifi cant capacity building of 
relevant institutions in the country and climatesensitive sectors, and inform the vulnerable 
population on climate change and adaptation 
options. Several of these issues have been

GOVERNANCE OF ENERGY
The energy sector needs to be governed for meeting 
social, environmental, and growth objectives linked 
to energy while providing conditions that are 
conducive to private investment, thus empowering 
local governments and communities to play a 
proactive role in managing energy systems.
Structure of the energy sector
One important aspect of governance is the 
ownership and structure of the energy sector and 
its regulation. For much of the 20th century and 
in most countries, network utilities were vertically 
and horizontally integrated state monopolies. 
The reasons for public control of infrastructure 
were many—the sector’s economic importance, 
a desire to protect public interest in industries 
supplying essential services, concerns about 
private monopolies, and the belief that the large 
investments required for infrastructure creation 
could only be augmented from public resources. 
However, the performance of state-owned 
monopolies was far from satisfactory, whether in 
terms of effi cient and cost-effective delivery of 
services or in the attainment of universal service 
obligations. The 1990s saw a dramatic change in 
views on how network utilities should be owned, 
organized, and regulated, with much emphasis 
on the effi ciency benefi ts of competition and 
privatization. However, over a period of time, a 
strong need has emerged to qualify the benefi ts 
of the new model and develop clear guidelines on 
how it should work (World Bank 2004). 
 One of the key messages that emerged from the 
experience of the last decade is that network utilities 
encompass distinct activities with entirely different 
economic characteristics. Electricity generation 
and distribution may be potentially competitive 
segments, but transmission is a natural monopoly 
operated by the public sector. 
 Further, the new model needs to be pursued 
after carefully assessing its institutional and 
structural prerequisites in a specifi c country or 
industry.
 In Bhutan, the Bhutan Power Corporation 
(BPC) is responsible for the construction and 
maintenance of the transmission and distribution 
network in the country. Additionally, the BPC also 
owns and operates small and micro power plants. 
Major power plants like Tala, Chukha, Kurichu, 
and Basochhu are operated by independent power 
corporations or authorities. The Department 
of Energy (DoE) has brought these generating 
companies under one umbrella by creating larger 
Druk Green Power Corporation Ltd (DGPC).
 Some of the issues that would need to be 
factored in while determining structural reforms 
in the energy sector are as follows.
State of network facilities Unbundling and 
introduction of competition require mature 
well-developed network facilities, minimizing 
the need for new investments wherein the 
incentive problems are more likely as compared 
to potentially competitive segments like 
distribution. In case of Bhutan, as discussed 
in Chapter 4, network facilities still require 
considerable expansion and investment.
Institutional capacity The transition from 
monopoly to competition or the co-existence 
of the two forms in different segments of 
the sector plays a critical role. Regulatory 
requirements in the latter systems are likely to be 
far more complex, requiring strong institutional 
capacity.
Profi le of consumers The general economic 
status of consumers and their ability to pay 
are important determinants of the success of 
privatization. Private investment may not be 
forthcoming in cases where the government 
wants to provide energy at lifeline tariffs to a 
large section of consumers, as is the case in 
Bhutan, unless the private investors are assured 
of a reasonable rate of return.

additional hydropower projects as well as operating 
and maintaining the built-in projects by 2008, in 
a manner similar to the National Hydro Power 
Corporation (NHPC) established in India.7
Further, transmission and distribution are likely 
to remain in the public sector in the foreseeable 
future. However, given the limited availability 
of public fi nancial and administrative resources, 
the government should tap private investment, 
including foreign capital, in the electricity 
generation sector and more proactively involve 
local communities in managing off-grid systems 
and the operation and maintenance of local 
distribution lines. 
Tariff regime
The other related issue in terms of fi nancial and cost 
constraints is tariff setting for the sale of electricity 
domestically and for exporting to India. Over the 
years, Bhutan has regulated the electricity prices 
domestically, setting them below the economic 
costs to fulfi l the social obligations and promote 
industrial sector. This act is justifi ed in providing 
assistance to the underprivileged sections and in 
promoting regional balanced development, but has 
led to increased ineffi ciencies in the consumption 
patterns of energy. Coupled with this is the lack 
of demand side management (DSM) measures, 
which have further resulted in ineffi cient usage of 
the available resources.
 The prevalent low tariffs have also resulted in 
subsidizing the ineffi ciencies in the industrial sector. 
While the pricing policies have been designed to 
strengthen the industrial base in Bhutan, provision 
of subsidized electricity in several ways can harm 
the economic progress if it is unable to generate 
adequate forward linkages to compete with the 
export proceeds of sale of power to India. In the 
current situation of low electricity tariffs, while 
power-intensive industries are foreseen to emerge, 
a careful feasibility analysis needs to be performed 
 The setting up of industries needs to be 
determined within an overall environmentally 
sustainable framework. Promotion of industries 
should be such that aspects such as available power, 
export of power, utilization of export proceeds, 
employment generation, value addition, trade, and 
alternative patterns of industrial growth are carefully 
considered. In the existing subsidized regime for 
the industrial sector, provision of subsidized power 
to the energy-intensive sector may be at the cost 
of revenues forgone from exports. Integrating the 
opportunity cost in supplying to the industrial 
sector, it is recommended that niche industries 
be encouraged in Bhutan, which utilize natural 
resources, along with other industries that can 
function with minimal energy. A note on viability 
of power-intensive industries is given in Box 6.
 The existing tariff regime should also be modifi ed 
so as to recover the complete economic cost of 
providing electricity. The tariff rationalization 
towards gradual removal of subsidies to high 
voltage and medium voltage consumers remains 
important in this respect. It is seen that while the 
average tariffs have been revised several times, 
they still remain highly subsidized. In January 
2003, the fl at rate system of tariff was replaced 
by the progressive charge with different rates for 
the domestic and industrial usage. Accordingly, in 
the low-voltage category, consumers with less than 
80 kWh consumption had to pay Nu 0.60 a unit, 
while the rate for those consuming 80–120 kWh 
and above 200 kWh per month was fi xed at Nu 
0.95 and Nu 1.20 per unit, respectively. The tariff 
for the medium and high voltage was fi xed at Nu 
0.95 and Nu 0.90 per unit, respectively, along with 
the capacity charge of Nu 54 000 per megawatt 
per month.
 Though the steps towards tariff revisions have 
reduced the level of subsidies, the burden still remains 
high. The Bhutan Electricity Authority (BEA), an 
independent regulator, has been entrusted with the 
responsibility of tariff regulation. The Authority

VIABILIT Y OF POWER INTENSIVE INDUSTRIES 
Electricity tariff s have largely been aff ordable to stimulate the industrial sector in Bhutan. The industrial sector 
consumes 26.4% of the total energy and is the largest consumer of electricity in the country; its consumption is 
pegged at 420 MU, which is about 64.7% of total electricity consumed by the industrial sector in 2005. The main 
manufacturing industries in Bhutan are Penden Cement Authority Ltd (PCAL), Bhutan Ferro Alloys Ltd (BFAL), and 
Bhutan Calcium Carbide Ltd (BCCL). Besides these, Druk Cement Company Ltd (DCCL), Druk Iron and Steel Plant 
(DISL), and Bhutan Steels Ltd (BSL) have also been set up, which consume almost 95% of the electricity used by 
the sector. 
 As seen from the energy demand analysis for the BAU (business-as-usual) scenario, with the upcoming 
industries that have recently received licenses, the energy demand from the sector is bound to increase in the 
coming years. This increased demand level would lead to a serious confl ict with the total available supply, which 
has to meet the growing needs of other sectors as well, besides industrial sector. Besides the availability factor, 
viability of the power industries is also dependent on the cost of available supply. With the prevalent low tariff 
regime for the industrial sector, industries are viable options. However, with the phasing out of subsidies, as 
proposed by the Bhutan Electricity Authority (BEA), their existence might come under threat.
would determine the tariff as per the tariff policy, 
with public announcement and dissemination. 
The overriding objective of the tariff policy has 
been gradual phasing out of the subsidies—a 10% 
increase in power tariff is proposed annually for 
the next fi ve years till 2012.
 Besides tariff revision, another option that 
could be explored in the context of Bhutan is 
cost plus tariff. In case the industry wishes to 
overdraw electricity, the regulator could consider 
the option of providing it at a cost above the actual 
tariff rate, subject to the availability and fulfi lment 
of legal requirements. The other alternative could 
be to charge the second tariff to the level of export 
proceeds. 
TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION OF 
ELECTRICITY
The power transmission and distribution network 
in Bhutan is managed by the BPC and comprises 
two main grids, the western grid and the eastern 
grid, each of them covering parts of eight 
Dzongkhags. 
System planning
The network can be divided into a bulk power 
transmission system for supplying power from 
Bhutan to India and an area supply or sub-station 
system for supplying domestic loads (WRMP 
2004).This chapter consolidates various 
components of the energy management 
plan in a comprehensive manner. The 
analysis carried out in the earlier 
chapters has identifi ed and quantifi ed current and 
future needs of the energy sector, and accordingly, 
certain strategies have been recommended with 
probable impact analysis.
INTEGRATED ENERGY MANAGEMENT PLAN 
COMPONENTS
The previous chapters discussed specifi c supply 
and demand side strategies for Bhutan. This 
chapter examines some overarching issues that 
cut across these strategies and, in a sense, link 
them with the larger development objectives of 
the country. 
 The national development targets, as refl ected 
in the Ninth Plan and Bhutan 2020, closely match 
the Millennium Development Goals and refl ect a 
strong national political commitment to socioeconomic development. Energy systems need 
to be planned in such a way that they promote 
these objectives, with a focus on poverty reduction 
and balanced regional development, taking into 
account the special needs of remote and rural 
communities. This will require an emphasis on 
small- and medium-sized units and reduced 
dependence on the (hydropower) construction 
industry such that the employment generating 
capacity of industry is enhanced. Also, there is an 
urgent need to revive agriculture through a focus 
on value-added products and rural development, 
since over 60% of the country’s labour force is still 
dependent on agriculture. 
Recommendations
 At the same time, energy development must 
plan for environmental externalities because, fi rst, 
augmenting energy infrastructure will have impacts 
on forests, biodiversity, and the environment; and 
second, in designing energy systems, the potential 
impacts of climate change in Bhutan need to be 
taken into consideration. 
 Governance of the energy sector will be crucial 
in meeting social and environmental obligations 
while tapping various sources of investments and 
building capacity across the tiers of the government 
to manage energy systems. This is especially 
relevant, since the political system in Bhutan is 
in a phase of transition. But fi rst, a critical crosscutting issue of energy security is considered, which 
almost all countries of the world are facing.
INSTITUTIONAL SET-UP 
The analysis of the energy sector of Bhutan 
reveals that there is no focal ministry/department 
to undertake the coordination of all the activities 
related to energy. Moreover, the relevant information 
on various energy sources/fuels is scattered 
along various sources because single source of 
information is not available. As far as renewable 
energy and energy conservation/effi ciency are 
concerned, there is very limited awareness among 
the stakeholders, particularly the users. This lack 
of awareness hampers their ability to make an 
informed and judicious choice. 
 The existing institutional infrastructure for the 
energy sector in Bhutan is shown in Figure 1.
 A brief note on different institutions presented 
in Figure 1 is given in the subsequent section. FIGURE 1 EXISTING INSTITUTIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE 
IN ENERGY SECTOR
Ministry of Economic Affairs
The erstwhile Ministry of Trade and Industry, 
which was subsequently renamed as the Ministry 
of Economic Affairs, was established in 1967. 
Initially, known as the Ministry of Trade, 
Commerce and Industry, it was established as a 
full-fl edged Ministry in 1968, under the reign of 
the third Druk Gyalpo His Majesty King Jigme 
Dorji Wangchuck, and renamed as the Ministry 
of Trade, Industry and Forests. Presently, besides 
the inclusion of the power and mining sector, it 
has been offi cially designated as the Ministry of 
Economic Affairs from 17 October 2007. The 
Ministry of Economic Affairs comprises four 
technical departments, namely, the departments 
of trade, industry, energy, and geology and mines 
besides the four service divisions, namely, the 
Policy and Planning; Administration and Finance; 
Human Resource; and Intellectual Property.
Department of Energy
The Department of Energy (DoE) within the 
Ministry of Trade and Industry has been formed 
during the restructuring process of the erstwhile 
Department of Power in July 2002. The DoE is 
responsible for the formulation of energy and 
preparing detailed project reports (DPRs) for the 
sustainable development of hydropower projects. 
The DoE also performs the function of Royal 
Government of Bhutan (RGoB)/donor/lender 
fund coordination related to energy/power sector 
projects. It also has the mandate to issue technoeconomic clearances and technical sanctions for 
all capital works in the energy/power sector.
Bhutan Electricity Authority
The Bhutan Electricity Authority (BEA) is a 
functional autonomous agency established as per 
Section 7 of the Electricity Act of Bhutan, 2001, to 
regulate the electricity supply industry of Bhutan. 
The Authority consists of four commission 
members and a chairman, appointed by the 
minister as per the Electricity Act, 2001, and has 
a full-time secretariat in Thimphu. Functions of 
the BEA are as follows.
To regulate the electricity supply industry.
To set technical, safety, and performance 
standards for the electricity supply industry.
To develop electricity tariff regulations and 
approve domestic tariffs.
To develop subsidy regulations.
To issue licenses and monitor compliance to 
licenses.
To settle disputes that may arise between licensees 
and between licensees and customers.
To prescribe royalties, fi nes, and penalties, to be 
paid by licensees.
Druk Holding and Investment
Pursuant to the Royal Charter dated 11 November 
2007, and the Executive Order of the prime 
minister, the Druk Holding and Investments 
Ltd (DHI) have been formed for the following 
purpose.
Hold shares of government-linked companies 
(GLCs), the primary mandate of which is 
commercial. 
Strengthen the corporate sector. 
Make investments by optimal usage of resources 
or raising funds.

#Druk Green Power Corporation
The Druk Green Power Corporation Ltd 
(DGPC) was formed on 1 January 2008, with 
the amalgamation of the erstwhile hydropower 
corporations. 
 The DGPC is responsible for the optimal 
utilization of resources in the management of existing 
power plants and building capacity to develop 
hydropower projects either independently, through 
joint venture or by any other arrangement.
Bhutan Power Corporation
Bhutan Power Corporation Ltd (BPC) was 
launched as a public utility on 1 July 2002, with 
the mandate of distributing electricity throughout 
the country and also providing transmission access 
for generating stations for domestic supply as well 
as export. One of BPC’s basic mandate was to not 
only ensure that electricity is available to all the 
citizens but to also make sure that it is reliable, 
adequate, and above all, within the means of all 
consumers.
 Given the complexities of different energy subsectors in the country, it is desirable to take an 
integrated and holistic approach to address myriad 
challenges that the country is facing in the fi eld of 
energy. It is, therefore, suggested to bring petroleum 
as well as coal under the purview of the DoE, 
besides electricity, renewable energy, and energy 
conservation/effi ciency. In order to take on these 
wider responsibilities, the DoE may be transformed 
into a full-fl edged Ministry of Energy. Indeed, 
Good Governance Plus document also mentions 
the formation of the Ministry of Energy and 
Water Resources Management. This move would 
accelerate the progress of development as envisaged 
in the vision documents and master plans.
 In the interim, the DoE may be mandated to 
look after not only the hydropower energy and 
renewable energy but also policies regarding 
import of petroleum fuels and coal. Thus, different 
departments/divisions may be created to look after 
the specifi c areas, as mentioned subsequently.
Hydropower promotion and trade 
Power systems 
Sustainable energy 
Fossil fuels
Considering the facts that (1) any surplus 
electricity is a potential source of revenue earner 
through exports and (2) the preservation of its 
pristine environment is country’s topmost priority, 
it is evident that much more emphasis would have 
to be laid on (1) new renewable energy resources 
(such as biomass and solar) and (2) energy 
conservation and energy effi ciency. To attain these 
goals, the present Renewable Energy Department 
(RED) may be converted to Sustainable Energy 
Department (SED). 
 The SED would, therefore, make the endeavour 
of mainstreaming renewable energy and energy 
effi ciency within the country. The SED would also 
help in taking an integrated view of the energy 
situation, wherein renewable energy and energy 
conservation play complementary roles. The broad 
functions of the SED will include the following.
Facilitation, policy formulation, planning, 
coordination, and monitoring
Promotion of R&D in renewable energy 
and energy effi ciency in association with the 
engineering colleges; demonstrations and 
resource assessment
Capacity development at various levels, including 
at the Dzongkhag levels
Energy labelling/endorsement
Financing
Knowledge management and awareness 
creation
Integration with other organizations and 
developmental programmes 
With the SED playing a pivotal role, the following 
institutional set-up is suggested to promote 
renewable energy and energy effi ciency. 
The SED would formulate guidelines, policy 
measures, plans, and programmes in consultation 
with Dzongkhags. The policy framework may

It may be desirable to have ‘decentralized 
institutional set-up’ at the Dzongkhag level. 
Rather than creating new agencies, the relevant 
existing department(s), like the Planning 
Department, may be designated and empowered 
to carry out activities related to renewable 
energy and energy effi ciency.
The SED may undertake setting up of energy 
effi ciency labelling programme in collaboration 
with the STQA and the Industrial Development 
Centre.

on renewable energy and energy effi ciency, 
which would function as a single source of 
information.

and electric/hybrid vehicles for personal transport 
are viable options for Bhutan.
 Hybrid (petrol–electric) and electric vehicles are 
now being developed by many major automobile 
manufacturers worldwide. 
 Use of electric vehicle by the individuals as well 
as for the public transport system may reduce 
the burden of import of petrol and diesel on 
the Bhutanese economy. It is observed that the 
replacement of personnel petrol vehicle and some 
public transport systems such as mini buses in the 
city like Thimphu with the electric vehicles can not 
only reduce the petrol consumption of the city but 
will also help in reducing pollution.
 Total petrol consumption in 2005 was 13 775 
kilolitres, which is projected to increase to 34 105 
kilolitres in 2015 and to 51 673 kilolitres in 2020 
under the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario. Petrol 
is mainly consumed by light transport vehicles such 
as cars and two-wheelers. In 2000, total number 
of light vehicles was 7438, which increased to 17 
712 in 2006. A projection has been made based on 
the trend from 2000 to 2006, and it is found that 
the number of light vehicles will be increased to 
48 452 in 2015 and to 73 680 in 2020 under the 
BAU scenario. To reduce the petrol consumption 
by vehicles, the government may promote the use 
of electric vehicles by citizens. An analysis on the 
potential savings in petrol accrued by using electric 
vehicles is presented in the subsequent section.
Economy of the use of electric vehicles
An analysis has been carried out for comparing the 
economy in the use of petrol vehicle and electric 
vehicle. The result is presented in Figure 3, which 
shows the cost in Nu/km/person for different 
occupancies of the vehicle. For the most common 
case of two occupancy, the use of petrol vehicle 
costs about Rs. 1.50 per person per kilometre, 
while the electric vehicle costs about Re 0.11 per 
person per kilometre (Figure 3). 
Potential for petrol saving by using electric 
vehicles
Following assumptions have been made to calculate 
the estimated petrol savings. 
Electricity consumed during one full charging 
of the electric vehicle is 9 kWh.
Distance travelled by electric vehicles in one full 
charging is 80 km. Mileage of petrol vehicle is 
12 km per litre.
Price of electricity is Rs. 2.00 per kWh.
Number of days the vehicles are used in a year 
is 365 days. 
Price of petrol is Rs 45.00 per litre.
Average run per day per vehicle is about 15 km.
It is suggested that initially, about 1000 personal 
electric vehicles may be introduced by 2012 and 
then up to 5000 vehicles by 2015 and up to 
15 000 vehicles may be introduced by 2020. Based 
on the assumptions given above, saving in the 
amount of petrol is calculated. It is estimated that 
by following this approach, total saving of petrol 
by the year 2015 will be about 2281 kilolitres, 
and by 2020, it will be about 6843 kilolitres. 
The replacement of petrol vehicles with electric 
vehicles will reduce the petrol demand in future 
and will increase the total electricity demand in 
Bhutan. Based on the above assumptions, it is 
estimated that by 2015, Bhutan may save about 
Nu 94 million per year, and by 2020, it will save 
about Nu 280 million per year.

Petrol vehicle Electric vehicleThe use of electric vehicle will also help Bhutan 
in keeping its environment clean and reducing 
the greenhouse (GHG) emission because of the 
reduction in petrol consumption and the use 
of clean electric power, which is generated by 
hydropower projects. It is estimated that by 2015, 
Bhutan can help in reducing about 5656 tCO2
 per 
year, and by 2020, about 16 969 tCO2 will be 
reduced per year by replacing petrol vehicles with 
electric vehicles. 
Strategy for the implementation of electric 
vehicles
The implementation of electric vehicles can be 
initially for the offi ce-goers, who will require 
employees may charge their vehicles whenever they 
want to. This charging facility may be available on 
paying nominal fees or it may be provided free 
to the employees to promote the use of electric 
vehicles in initial phase.
 Charging stations may be set up at various 
parking places and the charging facility can be 
provided free of cost as a subsidy to the electric 
vehicle owners. 
 The government may introduce mini buses 
running on electricity within Thimphu city and later 
on from Thimphu to Paro. It is, therefore, suggested 
to develop a master plan for the introduction of 
electric/hybrid vehicles in Bhutan.Projected socioeconomic variables

2020 3495 3495 5074 5074Tariff design
Tariff design, from the point of view 
of an operator, is aimed at profi t 
maximization, while the government’s 
interest is welfare maximization and 
making available affordable service to the poor. 
To maximize profi ts, the operator seeks prices 
that equate marginal revenue (defi ned as the extra 
revenue the operator receives when it increases 
output by one unit) and marginal costs. Different 
types of options exist for designing tariffs, and some 
of them are discussed in the subsequent sections.
MARGINAL COST PRICING
In case of competitive environment, marginal 
revenue equals marginal costs. This marginal cost 
pricing maximizes welfare, with the interest of 
the operator coinciding with the interests of the 
government. 
Deviation from marginal cost pricing: multipart 
prices
In case the operator possesses some market power, 
its profi t maximization prices would exceed the 
marginal cost, resulting in welfare loss unlike the 
perfectly competitive environment. An example 
of a deviation from the marginal cost pricing 
is the multipart tariffs, wherein the operator 
charges separate prices for different elements 
of the service unlike in linear tariff, wherein a 
single price is charged for the service. A common 
example of multipart tariff is the two-part tariff 
in the electricity sector, where the customer pays 
a monthly fee for access and a usage fee for the 
consumption of electricity. 
Optional tariffs
Optional tariffs are closely related to the multipart 
tariff, where the operator offers the customer 
a menu of pricing plans, amongst which the 
customer chooses the option that best meets his 
requirements.
Peak load pricing
Peak load pricing is a kind of pricing variation, 
wherein the operator would maximize his profi ts 
by charging higher prices during the peak hours 
and lower prices during the off-peak hours. The 
peak load pricing, however, requires sophisticated 
measurement of customer usage, with advanced 
metering technologies for energy and water sectors. 
The cost of implementing these technologies, 
however, must be weighed against the welfare 
gains for metering before pursuing the usage of 
peak load pricing.
REGULATION OF THE ENERGY SECTOR
Irrespective of the structure of the sector, there is a 
need to introduce an arms-length energy regulator, 
combining the powers of rule making (legislative) and 
implementation and enforcement (executive) with 
quasi-judicial powers of review and appeal against 
their orders (judicial). Independent regulation is 
required to safeguard consumer interests, especially 
those of vulnerable groups and geographically 
distant consumers, promote effi ciency and economy 
in the sector, accelerate decision-making, facilitate 
investors and others in planning and raising fi nances 
for the long-term investments, and supply quality 
services at economic prices. 
 The Bhutan Electricity Authority (BEA) has 
been established under the Electricity Act, 2001, 
to play the role of a regulator in the development of 
the energy sector. Some of the important functions 
of the Authority as per the Act include development 
of regulations, standards, codes, principles and 
procedures; process applications; modifying and 
revoking licences and monitoring the performance 
of licensees and their compliance; determining/breach of provisions of this Act; establishing a 
dispute resolution process; and settling disputes 
and other duties or responsibilities delegated by 
the minister.
 While the BEA can play the role of a regulator 
in the short term, experience worldwide has 
underscored the need for rule-making, decisionmaking or adjudicative functions to be under an 
independent regulator outside of the government 
and the legal system. Government departments 
may be perceived as not being able to provide 
insulation from external infl uences. Also, it may 
not be feasible to develop courts for different kinds 
of expertise required. In addition, independent 
regulators can also bring in more stability since 
they are not concerned with electoral politics but 
have to keep the interest of the public in mind. 
Further, entrusting price regulation to a regulatory 
body also has major advantages for governments—
it provides insulation from politically unpopular 
pricing decisions that need to be taken in the 
interest of the industry and creates a source of 
expertise. 
 In the foreseeable future, the government will 
remain the largest player in the electricity sector 
in the country (likely in the form of Druk Green 
Power Corporation). Here, the regulator should 
closely monitor the capital and revenue expenditure 
of the incumbent utility and ensure that costs are 
not padded so as to get higher tariffs or that the 
utility is not unduly burdened with the costs of the 
government’s social obligations. 
 Simultaneously, the regulator would need 
to identify segments where private capital and 
competition can be introduced. The regulator 
would need to ensure the harmonious co-existence 
of the private sector (in generation) with the natural 
monopoly segment, transmission, likely to remain 
in the public sector, with particular attention to 
non-discriminatory access to incumbent facilities. 
 One of the key areas that a regulator would need 
to focus on is tariff determination. The following 
issues are of importance.
# To set multi-year tariff principles.
To ensure that tariff is sensitive to the type of 
consumer, time of supply, area of supply, and 
nature/purpose for which supply is required. 
To promote renewable energy through incentives 
built into tariffs. 
Some other important functions of the regulator 
would be as follows.
Promoting energy effi ciency and enforcing 
various energy effi ciency measures and 
developing infrastructure/standards/codes for 
energy effi ciency. 
Promoting the growth of renewable and nonconventional sources of energy, including solar, 
mini-micro hydel, and so on. Regulator can look 
into the utilization/creation of additional funds 
to support the development of the renewable 
energy sector for electricity generation. 
Bridging the gap in people’s understanding 
of the sector, including the demand/supply 
situation and the accompanying imperatives, 
implications, and status of reforms through 
public hearings and proactive information 
dissemination, which are not merely perfunctory. 
This understanding is crucial for public buy-in 
of reforms, minimizing uncertainties in public 
reactions, and creating an environment that is 
more conducive for foreign direct investment 
(FDI).
The success of the regulator in meeting these 
objectives will require capacity, transparency, 
accountability, and a strong political and 
administrative commitment to their effectiveness. 
DECENTRALIZED ENERGY GOVERNANCE
Bhutan has a well-designed framework for 
decentralized planning process at the Dzongkhag 
and Gewog level. The government has established 
Dzongkhag Yargay Tshochung (DYT), or district 
development committees, giving the Dzongkhags 
administrative responsibilities. At the block level, 
Gewog Yargay Tshochung (GYT) has been formed

#the energy sector, these local bodies can play a 
major role in decentralized mini hydro projects and 
in operation and maintenance of local distribution 
lines, involving the local community in billing and 
collection.
 In the 1990s, small hydropower plants were 
managed by the community; however, due to 
various constraints such as lack of capacity and 
technical know-how required to operate and 
maintain these plants at community level, these 
plants were brought under the control of the Bhutan 
Power Corporation (BPC). However, recently built 
70-kW mini hydroplant at Chendenbji and 100-
kW hydroplant at Sengor are being transferred 
to community for operation and maintenance, 
with technical backstopping and support being 
provided by the Department of Energy (DoE)/BPC.
this purpose. This experiment has been successful 
so far, and in future, such decentralized governance 
of small plants should be encouraged. 
 Bhutan is also planning to develop FDI policy 
for hydropower development, which will encourage 
IPP and captive power production. A whole 
range of issues needs to be addressed for this to 
materialize. The DoE has suggested change in its 
current organization structure to include additional 
responsibilities such as negotiating contracts with 
private producers, marketing hydropower projects, 
and so on. 
 Ideally, regulator should look into these matters 
as an independent authority and develop suitable 
guidelines, regulation, and so on and advise the 
government on policy and rules, regulations, and 
acts.LEVELIZED TARIFF ESTIMATION

Many non-woody biomass residues 
cannot be used effi ciently, as 
they have low bulk densities. 
For example, the bulk density of 
majority of the agro-residues lies in the low range of 
50–200 kg/m3
 (Table 1) as compared to 800 kg/m3
for the coal of the same size. This necessitates huge 
storage space. This is combined with diffi culty in 
handling and higher transportation cost. All these 
factors make them uneconomical as a marketable 
commodity for their widespread utilization over 
longer distances. Also, low bulk densities and loose 
nature of available biomass are associated with 
faster burning of fuels, resulting in higher fl ue gas 
losses (lower operating thermal effi ciencies) and 
emissions in the form of fl y ash or particulates 
in the atmosphere. This makes them poor quality 
biomass fuel. In order to improve the marketability 
of the available loose biomass and exploit this 
renewable and sustainable source of energy, preprocessing becomes necessary.
 Densifi cation of biomass can be done by using 
briquetting or pelletizing technology, which 
compresses loose biomass into densifi ed form 
called briquettes or pellets. This takes care of the 
low bulk density of biomass and helps in reducing 
transportation and storage cost and improves the 
quality of biomass so that it could be used as a 
better combustible fuel. 
 Densifi ed briquette/pellet produced from 
biomass is a fairly good substitute for coal, lignite, 
and fi rewood, and offers several advantages. 
Densifi ed briquette is a renewable and sustainable 
source of energy. It has the following advantages.

APPROPRIATE BIOMASS RESIDUE FOR 
BRIQUETTING
Almost all types of biomass can be densifi ed. 
However, there are many factors that need to 
be considered before biomass qualifi es as an 
appropriate feedstock for briquetting. The main 
characteristics of appropriate biomass residue

Source Biomass thermo-chemical characterization, 
IIT Delhi, 2002Moisture content
Higher moisture content poses problem in grinding, 
and higher energy is required for drying operation. 
Therefore, biomass with lower moisture content, 
preferably below 10%–15%, is a more attractive 
feedstock for briquetting.
Ash content and composition
Majority of biomass residues (except rice husk 
with 20% ash) have low ash content, but they 
contain higher percentages of alkaline (especially 
potash) minerals. They also contribute towards 
lowering sintering temperature, leading to ash 
deposition, and higher ash content increases the 
slagging tendency, which becomes more intense 
in biomass with more than 4% ash.
Flow characteristic
Finer granular material with uniform size fl ows 
easily in fuel hoppers and storage bins/silos. 
 Thus, some of the appropriate biomass material 
for briquetting includes saw dust, coffee husk, 
groundnut shell, pulverized mustard stalk, cotton 
sticks, and so on. 
Binding mechanism of densification
Briquetting is one of the several agglomeration 
techniques used for the densifi cation of biomass 
residues. On the basis of compaction, briquetting 
technologies can be classifi ed as follows.
High pressure compaction
Medium pressure compaction
Low pressure compaction
Normally, binders are not required in high- and 
medium-pressure compaction, but sometimes, 
preheating of biomass is carried out to enhance the 
compaction process. In all compaction processes, 
individual particles are pressed together in a 
confi ned volume. In case of biomass, the binding 
mechanism under pressure can be divided into 
cohesion and adhesion forces, van der Waal’s 
attractive forces between solid particles, and 
mechanical interlocking bonds under pressure, 
#
#
#
cow dung, are used in low-pressure compaction 
to enhance adhesion among biomass particles by 
creating solid–liquid bridges. Lignin in biomass 
helps in creating such bonds due to its softening 
at higher temperatures and its adsorption on solid 
particle layers, which can contact, or penetrate 
into, each other. The strength of the resulting 
agglomeration depends on the type of interaction 
and the material characteristics. Selected important 
characteristics and their signifi cance are discussed 
in the following sections.
Effect of particle size
Granular biomass material of size 6-8 mm, with 
about 10%–20% powdery (< 4 mesh) material, 
normally gives best results. Though high-pressure 
(1000–1500 bar) compaction machines such 
as piston press or screw extruder can produce 
briquettes from larger particle size biomass, they 
can lead to the choking of the entrance to ram 
or die. Condensation of vapour released from 
larger particles on fi ner particles can create lumps, 
affecting free fl ow. However, only fi ner material is 
not always good due to low density and fl owability, 
and the presence of particles of varying size 
improves the packing dynamics, contributing to 
higher strength. 
Effect of moisture
Moisture content is a very critical factor. Right 
amount of moisture (7%–10%) develops selfbonding properties in lignocellulosic substances 
at elevated temperatures and pressures prevailing 
in piston press and screw extruder briquetting 
machines. Higher moisture content can result 
in poor and weak briquettes with cracks due to 
the escape of steam and also results in erratic 
operation due to the choking of feed fl ow 
because of steam formation. It is also important 
to maintain the moisture content in input feed 
material so as to ensure that briquettes produced 
have moisture content higher than the equilibrium 
value, otherwise it would regain moisture from the 
atmosphere, resulting in swelling during briquette Effect of biomass feed temperature
At higher temperatures, moisture of biomass gets 
converted into steam under higher prevailing 
pressures, which hydrolyses the hemicellulose and 
lignin portion of biomass into lower molecular 
carbohydrates, lignin products, sugar polymers, 
and other derivatives. These act like in situ binding 
material. Better compaction, along with higher 
biomass feed temperature and pressure, results in 
briquettes with higher density and strength (Figure 
1). This also softens the fi bres and their resistance 
to briquetting, which results in lower power 
requirements and reduction in wear of the contact 
parts. However, the temperature should be kept 
lower than 300 °C, as beyond this temperature, 
decomposition of biomass starts.
 Briquetting can be done with or without a binder 
material. No binders are generally required in 
high-pressure briquetting. Prior to its introduction 
into the briquetting machine, biomass has to be 
disintegrated into small size and then dried so 
that the moisture content is in the range of about 
12%–15%. Briquetting plants set up so far in India 
are using saw dust, bamboo dust, groundnut shell, 
mustard stalk, cotton stalk, coffee husk, bagasse, 
press mud, have a calorifi c value of the order of 
3800–4000 kcal/kg, which is considered good.
 Commercially, briquetting technologies used 
for biomass without binder include the briquetting 
machine based on 
screw press and 
ram-piston press technology. 
In both the piston press and screw press 
technologies, the application of high pressure 
increases the temperature of biomass, and lignin 
present in the biomass liquefi es and acts as a 
binder. 
Ram-piston press technology
Biomass briquetting using ram-piston technology 
involves drying, grinding, sieving, and compacting. 
Moisture is removed from the loose biomass with 
the help of a dryer, and then it is ground in a 
hammer mill grinder. The ground material is then 
separated from the air by using cyclone separator. 
It is then sieved and stored in the bin above hopper 
for ensuring continuous fl ow of biomass material 
into the press. In piston press technology, biomass 
is punched into a die by a reciprocating ram to

frequent maintenance and/or replacement. The 
average frequencies of replacement for some of 
the machine components are 300 hours (for ram, 
scrapper, and wear rings) and 500 hours (taper 
and split die, and hammers).
 In India, commercially available piston press 
briquetting machines are commonly used in 
different parts of the country. They are available 
in different capacities, ranging from 250 kg/
hour to 2250 kg/hour. Table 2 gives the share of 
various input costs in the production of biomass 
briquettes. It can be seen that at higher production 
capacities, the raw material contributes more as 
input cost, and the share of other costs diminishes 
due to scale of production. Table 3 gives the power 
requirement for machines with different capacities 
for briquetting various types of biomass materials. 
Power requirement is higher for higher capacity 
machines. Production capacity increases from fi ner 
to coarser to stalky biomass due to increasing preprocessing requirement of biomass. Wet biomass 
requires higher power for additional drying 
operation in order to bring the moisture content in 
feed material to uniform desired value for smooth 
operation as well as for generating better quality 
briquettes. 
Screw press technology
In this process, biomass is dried to get an optimum 
moisture content value by passing hot air produced

Cycloneto minimize wear of the die and improve the true 
density of the briquettes formed. This preheated 
material is then fed to the screw extruder, 
where revolving screw (at about 600–700 RPM) 
continuously compacts the material through a 
tapered die, which is heated externally to reduce 
friction between the biomass and die surface 
(Figure 3). The outer surface of the briquettes 
obtained through this technology is partially 
carbonized and has a hole in the centre. 
 The briquettes extruded using screw press are 
more homogeneous (as output is continuous and 
not in strokes), with better crushing strength and 
combustion properties (due to large combustion 
area per unit weight). Since outer surface of the 
briquettes is carbonized, it facilitates easy and 
clean ignition, and this impervious layer provides 
protection from moisture ingress, thereby increasing 
the storage life of the briquettes. However, power 
consumption and wear of screw are higher than 
those experienced in ram-piston-type reciprocating 
machines.
 Table 4 shows a comparison between a piston 
press and a screw extruder.
Pelletizing machine
Biomass with very low bulk density is normally 
densifi ed using fl at die pelletizing technique. 
Pelletizing generally requires conditioning of 
biomass material either by mixing binder or raising 
the temperature of the biomass by direct addition 
of steam. The material is dropped in the pressing 
chamber of the pellet mill, where it builds a carpet 
on the die surface. The rollers roll over this layer 
and compress it through tapered die holes. The 
pressing force keeps on increasing during rolling 
in the direction of die holes. With every roll pass,

LOW-DENSITY BRIQUETTES USING BINDER
In remote areas, for decentralized operation, a 
simple low-pressure briquettng technique using 
binder material like tar or cow dung is generally 
adopted. The Energy and Resources Institute 
(TERI), New Delhi, has developed a simple screw 
extruder (Figure 5) coupled to a small motor, 
which produces medium-density briquettes 
(400–600 kg/m3
). The system was operated 
in village Dhanwas in Haryana for converting 
locally available agro-residues (mustard stalk) 
into briquettes (after manual preprocessing like 
chopping and pulverizing) using cow dung as a 
binder material. These briquettes were sold in 
local area as fuel substitute to coal in roadside 
restaurants (called dhabas) and as gasifi er fuel to 
provide electricity to village community and for 
operating the briquetting machine (Raman et al. 
1993). 
 Recently, TERI has successfully carried out 
feasibility study for making briquettes from oil 
refi nery waste sludge by mixing it with locally 
available loose biomass material. This would not 
only take care of the waste disposal problem of 
hazardous waste from oil refi neries but also produce 
easy-to-use briquettes, which can substitute coal 
in the surrounding region (TERI 2001). 
 In IIT Delhi, a simple briquetting plant operated 
by hand mould was developed for making beehive 
charcoal briquette for using it as a clean burning 
fuel, substituting charcoal. Locally available leafy 
biomass or pine needles are carbonized 
using simple pyrolyser, which is prepared 
using 200 litres of used oil barrel. This 
is then mixed with suitable binding 
material like clay and cow dung, and 
the mixture is prepared using adequate 
quantity of water. This material is then 
pressed into hand mould to form large 
cylindrical briquettes of about 90 mm 
height and 125 mm diameter, with 
several (about 19) parallel vertical holes 
in it (Figure 6). One person can make FIGURE 5 LOW-DENSITY SCREW EXTRUDING BRIQUETTING MACHINE

(spiral)about 30 briquettes (weighing about 0.5 kg after 
drying) per hour if charcoal–clay mixture is kept 
ready. These briquettes after drying can be used in 
angethi chulha, which burns slowly for long duration 
without releasing any smoke. These are becoming 
popular as livelihood option in rural areas. With 
about 20% clay content in hardwood charcoal 
powder, the calorifi c value is about 18 MJ per 
kg, or 9 MJ per briquette, and one briquette can 
burn for about an hour. Normally, single briquette 
is used in Indian chulha, but multiple vertically 
stacked briquettes for long duration operation are 
commonly used in high altitude areas of Tibet.
FIGURE 6 LOW-DENSITY BEEHIVE BRIQUETTING MOULDINTRODUCTION 
Biomass can be utilized for different purposes 
such as cooking, process heating, electricity 
generation, steam generation, mechanical or shaft 
power applications, as well as producing variety 
of chemicals as by-products. Various biomass 
conversion processes can be broadly classifi ed into 
the following categories.
Thermo-chemical

 - Suspension burners
 - Fluidized bed systems
 Pyrolysis

 - Cross draft
 - Fluidized bed
 Liquefaction
 Ammonia production
Chemical: acid hydrolysis

Physical: densifi cation into briquettes
Only a few of these technologies are covered 
under the planned Global Environment Facility 
(GEF) project, given the scale and type of target 
industries concerned. Other technologies are yet 
to be commercialized, for their scale of operation 
is not suitable for the target intervention clusters.
COMBUSTION 
Combustion is the direct process of converting 
biomass into usable energy, which can be used 
for various applications. The most diffi cult aspect 
#

$
$
$
$
#
#
$
$
#
of combustion is to start the process, as high (at 
least 550 °C) temperature is required for the 
ignition of biomass. However, once ignition takes 
place, it is diffi cult to stop the combustion process 
if suffi cient air supply is available till complete 
combustion converts the biomass into residual 
ash. Figure 1 shows the fi re triangle, emphasizing 
essential components like fuel, air, and heat, which 
permit fi re/combustion to continue to grow. Fire 
can be extinguished either by removing fuel or by 
smothering (removing air) or by cooling (spraying 
with water). 
 Biomass combustion is being used for various 
useful applications such as electricity generation, 
process heating, and cogeneration (simultaneous, 
sequential production of electricity and process 
heat). With rising prices of fossil fuels, biomass 
is gaining importance, and there is increasing 
refi nement of the biomass combustion process to 
exploit its energy content. In order to harness the 
energy content of the biomass to the maximum, 
it is important to understand the properties of 
biomass fuels and fundamentals of numerous 
complex reactions associated with their oxidation 
to carbon dioxide and water. This can help in

oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water through 
a series of free radical reactions, resulting in the 
liberation of useful heat. General combustion 
mechanisms have been proposed, defi ning various 
stages of chain reactions like initiation, propagation, 
and termination. Generally, these mechanisms 
include the following processes.
Heating and drying
Pyrolysis and reduction
Gas phase pre-combustions and combustion

Post-combustion reactions
A general biomass combustion model is shown in 
Figure 2. This general model gives some insight 
into combustion reaction that can be generalized 
as

Direct combustion systems are generally used to 
produce heat, which can be either used directly 
or transferred to working fl uid, such as steam, for 
further use in process heating or in steam engine 
or turbine for power production. The combustion 
effi ciency can be defi ned as follows.

Flame temperature also plays an important role 
in the overall effi ciency of combustion device. 
Excess air has more infl uence on adiabatic fl ame 
temperature than moisture content. Theoretically, 
highest temperature can be achieved with 
stoichiometric air supply (λ = 1), but in reality, 
excess air is always supplied to ensure complete 
combustion. The optimal values of lambda depend 
on furnace design, fuel type, and fuel feeding/fi ring 
system used. The value of λ in well-designed 
furnaces/combustion devices is in the range 1.6–
2.5, while in poorly designed furnaces, the value 
of λ reaches as high as 4–5. 
BIOMASS STOVES 
Archaeological evidence indicates that mankind 
has known the use of fi re for 400 000 years now. 
In the early years, fi re was used to keep the caves 
warm. The use of fi re for cooking started 100 000 
years ago, and in the earlier days, open fi re was 
used (mainly for cooking/roasting meat), with fuel 
arranged in pyramid shape. The benefi ts of fi re in 
preserving food, protecting against large animals 
and rodents, and providing warmth outweighed 
the drawbacks of improper control on fi re and 
smoky conditions. A major development in open 
fi re was the evolution of vessels of different shapes, 
followed by the development of shielded threestone stove for holding the pot fi rmly over the 
open fi re. Subsequently, shielded fi re was changed 
to a U-shaped mud or mud/stone stove, with front 
opening for feeding fuel and entry of combustion 
air. Despite several 
developmental work on wood 
stoves, large population in 
the developing world still 
employs traditional threestone or U-shaped shielded 
fi re stove, and in many 
cases, there is a retrogressive 
movement from the use of 
wood to the use of cow dung 
cakes and agro-residues as 
fuel (FAO 1993). FIGURE 2 REPRESENTATIVE MODEL OF BIOMASS COMBUSTION MECHANISMagroresidues are called biomass stoves. These are 
used at both domestic as well as institutional levels 
for cooking, heating, and space heating purposes. 
 Stoves burning biomass can be classifi ed in 
several different ways, based on their attributes, 
functions, material, fuel types, and so on (FAO 
1993). Stoves can be classifi ed as follows.
Fuel type: woody biomass, powdery biomass, 
briquettes, cow dung, and so on.
Function: monofunction or multifunction 
stoves
Construction material: metal, clay, ceramic, 
brick, and so on. 
Portability: portable (metallic, ceramic) or fi xed 
(mud, clay, brick)
Number of pots: single, two pots, three pots, 
and so on.
Stove designed for a particular fuel and for a 
particular application can be 
used with different fuels and 
can have various applications 
but might not perform with 
same effi ciency.
Design criteria 
Stove is a consumer-specifi c 
device. Efforts on developing 
improved stoves are mainly 
aimed at improving energy 
effi ciency (saving fuel) or 
reducing emissions (improving 
working conditions, reducing 
adverse impact on health). 
While designing a stove, 
both engineering and 
non-engineering or social 
parameters are required to be 
considered. 
Social factors 
Interlinkage between various 
criteria for stove design is shown 
in Figure 3 (Verhaart 1983). 
User need and availability of

operations such as boiling, frying, baking, grilling, 
steaming, pressure cooking, and so on, which are 
needed to be performed using a stove. Apart from 
this, it is also important to know cooking time and 
process heat requirement, which would determine 
power range for the stove. Availability of the local 
construction material, desired portability, seasonal 
availability of local biomass, and so on also need 
to be considered while designing a stove for the 
target group under consideration. 
Technical factors 
A high-performance stove should be effi cient 
and low in emission. A fuel-effi cient stove would 
reduce the drudgery of users in fuel collection, 
while improvement in emissions would save users 
from harmful impacts due to smoke exposure.

FIGURE 3 DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR A STOVEThough this strategy improves the fuel effi ciency 
and also indoor air quality, the overall emission 
reduction is questionable. Therefore, besides 
improving the heat transfer effi ciency, it is necessary 
to ensure improvement in combustion effi ciency, 
whereby emission of unburned harmful pollutants 
can be minimized. Complete combustion can be 
ensured by adopting the following steps.
Maintaining higher temperatures in the 
combustion chamber.
Providing suffi cient air and ensuring proper 
mixing for complete combustion.
Ensuring suffi cient residence time for the 
completion of combustion reactions.
Process factors 
Composition of biomass in terms of C–H–O 
content, ash, and moisture-free nature is quite 
similar (as mentioned earlier), but other parameters 
such as moisture content and volatile fraction have 
profound effect on its combustion characteristics. 
Besides, there are a number of other process 
factors that need to be considered while designing 
a stove for maximizing effi ciency and minimizing 
emissions. The effects of these process factors are 
not easily quantifi able. Table 1 summarizes their 
qualitative effect.
 The overall thermal effi ciency (ηo
) of a stove is 
defi ned as the ratio of the amount of useful heat 
absorbed for cooking food to the amount of energy 
content in the fuel used. It is a combination of 
partial effi ciencies such as combustion effi ciency 
ηc
 (fraction of energy content of a fuel converted 
into heat through its combustion), heat transfer 
effi ciency ηh
 (fraction of heat generated, which 
is transferred to the pot), and pot effi ciency ηp
(fraction of useful energy actually used for cooking 
food out of total heat transferred to pot). 
Emissions from biomass stoves

Among the numerous pollutants emitted from 
biomass stoves, the most signifi cant ones are carbon

monoxide (CO), total suspended particulates 
(TSP), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), 
and formaldehyde. Several design and operating 
parameters result in incomplete combustion, thus 
contributing to these emissions. These parameters 
include insuffi cient supply of combustion air, lower 
temperatures in combustion zone, improper mixing 
of air and fuel, and so on. Many a times, some design 
modifi cations to improve thermal performance or 
effi ciency, such as reducing gap between the pan 
and the stove mouth as well as between the pan 
and the grate, may prove detrimental, resulting in 
increased emissions. Therefore, there is a need to 
take into consideration the effect of any design 
modifi cation on stove as a whole. Generally, 
with increasing power levels, emissions from the 
stove are observed to increase. Similarly, higher

BIOMASS GASIFICATION 
Thermochemical biomass gasifi cation is a process 
in which solid biomass fuel is converted into 
gaseous combustible form (called producer gas) 
by means of partial oxidation. The reaction is 
carried out at elevated temperatures in a reactor 
called gasifi er. Application of gasifi ers assumed 
signifi cant importance during World War II 
due to the scarcity of petroleum products. By 
the end of the World War in 1942, more than 
million vehicles using gasifi ers were in operation 
throughout the world. However, after the end of 
the War, they were largely decommissioned, as 
petroleum products once again became widely 
available at cheap rates. The energy crisis in the 
1970s generated renewed interest in gasifi cation. 
The technology was perceived as a relatively 
cheaper option in developing countries having 
suffi cient sustainable biomass for small-scale 
industrial as well as power generation applications. 
Gasifi cation of biomass looks simple in principle, 
and many types of gasifi ers have been developed. 
Production of gaseous fuel from solid fuel offers 
easy handling, better control on combustion, 
and possibility of using it in internal combustion 
engine for shaft power or electricity production, 
which makes gasifi cation very appealing, especially 
for small decentralized options. However, biomass 
fuel used in gasifi er varies widely in its physical 
and chemical properties, and makes the gasifi er 
reactions complicated to design.
Principle of gasification 
Biomass gasifi cation is a process of converting 
solid biomass fuel into gaseous combustible gas 
(called producer gas) through a sequence of 
complex thermochemical reactions. In the fi rst 
stage, partial combustion of biomass to produce 
gas and char occurs along with the generation 
of heat. This heat is utilized in drying biomass 
to evaporate its moisture as well as for pyrolysis 
mainly consists of a mixture of combustible gases 
such as CO, hydrogen, traces of methane, and 
other hydrocarbons. Normally, the air is used as 
a gasifying agent; however, the use of oxygen can 
produce rich, higher calorifi c value gas, but due to 
cost implications, it is not usually preferred. 
Gasification reactions 
A complete understanding of the various complex 
reactions occurring in a gasifi er has not been 
possible so far. However, the following reactions 
explain the process of gasifi cation fairly well. 
C+O2 —> CO2

(combustion)
C+H2
O —> CO+H2 – 131 400 kJ/kg mole

O —> CO2+H2+41 200 kJ/kg mole 
 (water shift reaction)
C+2H2 —> CH4
+75 000 kJ/kg mole 
 (methane reaction)
With the help of the above reaction scheme, and 
with the knowledge of the equilibrium constants, it 
is possible to predict the equilibrium composition of 
the gaseous products. The equilibrium composition 
of a given solid fuel depends on the air supply 
per unit weight of the biomass. A dimensionless 
parameter, known as the equivalence ratio (ER), 
is applied to characterize the air supply conditions, 
and is usually defi ned as follows.
 Weight of the actual oxygen supplied/Weight of 
the theoretical oxygen required
 The denominator in the above equation is the 
oxygen required for the complete combustion 
of the fuel, and it varies from fuel to fuel. It is 
generally observed that for effective gasifi cation, 
the ER should be in the range of 0.2–0.4. Below 
the ER value of 0.2, pyrolysis dominates the 
process and above the ER value of 0.4, combustion 
predominates. 
 In a real gasifi er, however, the composition of 
the gas does not reach the equilibrium value and is time, and the residence time distribution. These 
are, in turn, dependent on the mode of air entry, 
dimensions of the gasifi er, and the quantum of 
heat loss to the surroundings. The modelling of 
the various processes occurring in the gasifi er 
requires not only the knowledge of kinetics but 
also an understanding of the heat and mass transfer 
processes occurring in various zones of the gasifi er. 
A brief description of some important factors that 
affect the quality of producer gas generation in 
gasifi er is given subsequently.
Fuel size 
Fuel size affects fuel movement within biomass as 
well as the rate of reactions and energy intensity 
per unit volume. Large wood pieces provide smaller 
surface area per unit volume of reactor, which, in 
turn, affects the quality of gas, as volatilization or 
pyrolysis becomes less intense. Very small-sized 
biomass leads to intense volatilization process, 
leading to the formation of signifi cant pyrolytic 
liquid, which is not desirable in gasifi cation, though 
it might be desired otherwise for obtaining liquid 
fuel. Larger fuel size also leads to fuel bridging, 
which hampers the smooth fuel movement within 
gasifi er reactor. Smaller fuel size results in higher 
pressure drop across the fuel bed in the reactor. 
Therefore, normally, fuel of the size one-fourth or 
one-fi fth of the smallest dimension of the reactor 
cross-section is preferred to avoid fuel bridging. 
If pulverized fuel is used in the fi xed bed gasifi er, 
the fuel movement becomes non-uniform and 
takes place in an uneven manner, and many a 
times, tunnelled gas pathways are generated in the 
fuel bed, causing tar carryover without cracking, 
resulting in high tar content in raw gas. 
Fuel moisture content 
With higher moisture content, the net calorifi c 
value of fuel decreases and so does the calorifi c 
value of the producer gas generated, thereby leading 
to a reduction in gasifi cation effi ciency. Also, the 
tar fraction in the producer gas increases with an 
increase in the moisture in the biomass. Because 
for achieving endothermic gasifi cation reactions. 
As a result, with higher moisture content in the 
biomass, the carbon dioxide fraction in the gas 
increases and CO fraction reduces. It also becomes 
diffi cult to maintain high fuel bed temperature, as 
the biomass has very high moisture content. The 
percentage of hydrogen in the gas increases slightly 
initially till the biomass has about 20% moisture 
content, but then again it starts decreasing.
Residence time 
Often, the effect of residence time is overlooked 
while designing a gasifi er. In order to generate 
good quality gas at various rates of fuel burning 
(or rates of producing gas), there is a need to 
ensure suffi cient time for the completion of 
gasifi er reactions within the reactor zone. This 
helps in achieving tar cracking under reducing 
environment in the high temperature zone in the 
presence of char, resulting in reduced components 
for tar cracking. Cleaning in this system may work 
out to be a costly affair, especially for smaller 
systems. 
Ash content and its nature 
Materials with high ash content are diffi cult to 
handle, as they can lead to the problem of clinker 
formation in the fuel bed, especially if ash has low 
fusion point. Also, the presence of several inorganic 
matters such as mud, sand, and grit is not quite 
unusual in agro-based biomass. This may not pose 
any problem in combustion devices/furnaces but 
can block the entire reactor operation due to ash 
fusion taking place inside the reactor at higher 
temperatures, which hampers the fuel movement 
and gasifi cation process.
Gasifier reactor types 
The various types of reactors used for biomass 
gasifi cation can be classifi ed in different ways, 
of which density factor (ratio of dense biomass 
phase to total reactor volume) is a simple and 
effective way of classifi cation. Thus, gasifi ers can 
be classifi ed as follows.In dense phase reactors, such as fi xed bed reactors 
(updraft, downdraft, cross draft, and so on), 
biomass or feedstock occupies maximum reactor 
volume, with typical density factors of about 
0.3–0.8. On the contrary, in lean phase reactors, 
such as fl uidized bed reactors, biomass occupies 
very little reactor volume, that is, of the order of 
0.05–0.2. Dense phase reactors can be classifi ed 
as follows.
Updraft, or countercurrent gasifier
In a countercurrent moving bed reactor, also called 
as updraft gasifi er, the air fl ows in countercurrent 
to downward fuel fl ow and enters into the gasifi er 
from below the grate and fl ows in the upward 
direction within the gasifi er. The updraft gasifi er 
has defi ned distinct zones for partial combustion, 
reduction, and distillation (Figure 4A). The gas 
produced in the reduction zone leaves the gasifi er 
reactor, along with the pyrolysis products and 
the steam from the drying zone. The resulting 
combustible producer gas is rich in hydrocarbons 
(tars) and, therefore, has relatively higher calorifi c 
value. Therefore, it is more suitable for thermal 
applications such as direct heating in industrial 
has to be cleaned thoroughly. 
 In most updraft gasifi ers, steam is injected or 
evaporated into the hot partial combustion zone, 
which has a benefi cial effect on the gas quality 
and also prevents the lower portion of the gasifi er 
from overheating. Generally, the sensible heat of 
the producer gas or the radiative heat from the 
gasifi er shell is used for generating the necessary 
amount of steam. 
 The characteristics of an updraft gasifi er are as 
follows.
It has clearly defi ned zones for various 
reactions. 
Its effi ciency is high because hot gases pass 
through entire fuel bed and leave at lower 
temperatures. The sensible heat of the hot gas 
is used for reduction, pyrolysis, and drying 
processes.
Products from pyrolysis and drying, containing 
water vapour, tar, and volatiles, leave the gasifi er 
without passing through high temperature 
zones and, therefore, do not get cracked. Hence, 
elaborate gas cleaning is required before using 
it, making it less suitable for engine operation.
It is unsuitable for high volatile fuels.
Downdraft, or co-current gasifier 
In a co-current moving bed reactor, or a downdraft 
gasifi er, the air enters at the middle level of the 
gasifi er, above the grate, and the resulting mixture 
of air and gas fl ows down cocurrently through the 
gasifi er reactor (Figure 4B). All the decomposition 
products from the pyrolysis and drying zones are 
forced to pass through an oxidation zone. This 
leads to the thermal cracking of the volatiles, 
resulting in reduced tar content in the producer 
gas. For this reason, this gas is preferred for engine 
applications. There is always a constriction at the 
level of the oxidation zone to force the pyrolysis 
products through a concentrated high temperature 
zone to achieve complete decomposition. This 
concentrated oxidation zone can cause sintering or 
slagging of ash, resulting in clinker formation and 
consequent blocking of the constricted area and/or

or other mechanical shaking may be required 
to avoid this problem. Compared to an updraft 
gasifi er, the disadvantages of a downdraft gasifi er 
are higher gas outlet temperature and lower thermal 
effi ciency. Additional steam or water injection is 
not common in downdraft gasifi ers. They can be 
operated at very high specifi c gasifi cation rate – in 
the range 2900–3900 kg/h m2
 – which corresponds 
to about 1 Nm3
/h m2 (highest reported was 5020 
kg/h m2
). The initial ignition time required for a 
downdraft gasifi er is lower compared to an updraft 
gasifi er, which is in the range of 15–20 minutes, but 
it is still perceived longer. A downdraft gasifi er has 
relatively better load following capability (ability 
to quickly extend the partial combustion zone to 
produce higher required gas quantity).
 The characteristics of a downdraft gasifi er are 
as follows.
Before leaving, tar-laden gases pass through the 
high temperature bed of coal in the oxidation 
zone and, hence, get cracked. Thus, the output 
gases are relatively clean, requiring less elaborate 
gas cleaning system.
The gases leave at a relatively high temperature, 
about 400–500 °C; hence, the operating thermal 
effi ciency of this gasifi er is less than that of an 
updraft gasifi er.
#
#
Cross-draft gasifier 
In a cross-draft gasifi er, the air enters from one 
side of the gasifi er reactor, and gas leaves from the 
other side (Figure 4C). A cross-draft gasifi er has 
very few applications and can hardly be credited 
with any advantage besides a good permeability of 
the bed. The characteristics of this type of gasifi er 
are given below. 
Grate not required.

The high exit temperatures of the gas and high

Producer gas cleaning and conditioning 
As mentioned earlier, the quality of gas with 
respect to impurities such as tar, dust, and water 
vapour varies with different reactors, and even for a particular reactor type, it varies with the fuel 
used as well as operating conditions. Depending 
on the application, the gas needs to be cleaned and 
conditioned. There is always a possibility of tar 
and vapour condensing along with dust particles 
to form a semi-solid mixture, which blocks various 
fi lters and gasifi er system components down the 
line. In order to prevent this, the gas is cleaned and 
conditioned. However, the best strategy would be to 
obtain a clean gas, which, in turn, would reduce gas 
cleaning requirement. Normally, dust particulates 
from the gas are removed in hot conditions (tar 
and water vapour remaining in gaseous form), and 
then the gas is cooled to condense tar and water 
vapour to form liquid condensate, which is then 
trapped and removed. The extent of treatment 
required varies, depending on gas applications.
 Generally, no elaborate treatment is required 
for direct thermal applications of gas, as all the tar 
gets burned if burner is designed properly. Thus, 
only dust particulates are removed. However, if 
the gas is to be used directly for drying seeds or 
agricultural products, tar needs to be removed, as 
the seed layer acts like a granular bed fi lter and 
tar gets deposited in the fi rst layer. Similarly, in 
some cases, tar needs to be removed in pottery or 
ceramic industry application in order to prevent 
any adverse effect on the product quality. 
Producer gas utilization 
Depending on the gasifying agent, like air and 
oxygen/steam, gas with low (calorifi c value of 3–7 
MJ/Nm3
) or medium (calorifi c value of 12–16 
MJ/Nm3
) heat value is produced. In most of the 
gasifi ers, air is used as a gasifying agent, and so, 
gas with low heating value is produced, which 
needs to be utilized at the site, as compressing 
and transporting it become expensive due to high 
(about 50%–55%) nitrogen content in gas.
 The primary objective of gasifi cation is to 
convert solid biomass into a more convenientto-use gaseous form (two steps up on the energy 
ladder) called producer gas, which, in turn, can be 
used in gas burners to use biomass more effi ciently

 Various gas characteristics (physical and

the performance of the gas in a burner. These are 
listed as below.

Stoichiometric air requirement (for complete 
combustion)
Flame speed coeffi cients of gas constituents
Variation in these parameters can result in fl ame 
lift-off (excessive gas velocity, resulting in its losing 
contact with the burner), internal burning of fl ame 
back (lower gas velocity than fl ame propagation, 
resulting in internal burning) or unstable fl ame. 
Flame back can be dangerous as fl ame starts 
moving upstream in a premixed gas–air mixture 
and can be prevented by fl ame arrester but can 
result in the fl ame getting extinguished. While 
changing the type of gaseous fuel used in the 
gas burner, there is a need to give attention to 
calorifi c value (heating value), stoichiometric air 
requirements, and its effect on adiabatic fl ame 
temperature as well gas fl ue gas volumes. Table 4 
gives a comparison for the usage of low heating 
value (LHV), medium heating value (MHV), and 
natural gas in the burner. 
 It can be observed that for the generation of 1 MJ 
of energy, the producer (LHV) gas requirement is 
8.5 times higher than the natural gas requirement. 
As a result, higher fl ue gases are generated when

losses. Lower fl ame temperature attainable with 
producer gas can have limitations in its use (and 
so at higher temperatures like metal melting of 
cement kiln dual fi ring becomes necessary) and 
also result in lower heat transfer effi ciencies, 
resulting in derating of burner capacity.
Gasifier stove 
The heating of biomass causes chemical 
decomposition (‘pyrolysis’), which releases volatile 
solids or gases, which need to be subsequently 
burned in ‘secondary combustion’ process. This 
process occurs nearly simultaneously in regular 
biomass combustion stoves/fi res, making the two 
stages diffi cult to observe or even control. But if 
these pyrolysis gases are not burned immediately, 
they can escape as products of incomplete 
combustion (PIC). As mentioned earlier, the 
PIC have more global warming potential (GWP) 
than carbon dioxide, which is obtained through 
complete combustion of fuel. The pyrolysis process 
is easier to understand, observe, and control. This 
process is informally known as ‘gasifi cation’. As 
mentioned earlier, commercially viable gasifi cation 
has long been understood and used in the industry 
sector and even in transportation, but does not 
fi nd application for small applications such as a 
household stove.
 Since 1985, Dr T B Reed worked for about 
a decade on the development of a very small 
gasifi er for meeting the domestic stove needs of 
impoverished people. He worked on developing

the order of 30%–35%. Later, he worked on sizing 
the stove and trying to use it for making charcoal. 
There was no real success with applications. So, 
Dr Reed stopped his research work in 1995. 
However, later in 1998, he began working on a 
smaller, forced convection model with a fan, and 
turbo-stove.
 A series of modifi cations and improvisation 
resulted in the gasifi er turbo-stove concept. These 
modifi cations include different stackable units 
in a heat column over a gasifi er unit with an air 
pipe, smaller holes for the entrance of secondary 
air, pre-heated secondary air, a tapered chimney, 
and independent structural components for the 
stove body. The gasifi er chamber is removable and, 
therefore, can be emptied to save the resultant 
charcoal, re-loaded with biomass, re-lighted, and 
re-inserted into the heat column. Later in 2002, a 
‘wood gas camp stove’ was developed with forced 
air designs with the intention of constructing a stove 
for the affl uent North American camper market. It 
had a battery-powered fan and could produce an 
impressive blue fl ame for sustained periods. 
BIOGAS TECHNOLOGY 
Microbial conversion of agricultural, industrial, 
and domestic waste has been a common practice 
for the past 50 years. The conversion leads to the 
utilization of biomass waste as a valuable resource 
and production of a fuel gas called biogas, which 
can be used for cooking, lighting, and power 
generation. Biogas systems have, in recent years, 
become an attractive option for decentralized 
rural development, as they produce a cheap fuel 
and good quality, rich manure. They also provide 
an effective and convenient way for disposing of

Process 
The process of anaerobic digestion is a threestage process. The stages proceed simultaneously 
and include the activities of diverse group of 
microbes with specifi c metabolic requirements. In 
the fi rst stage of enzymatic hydrolysis, bacteria like 
Clostridium, Ruminoccus, and Cellumonas produce 
extracellular enzymes, such as cellulase, protease, 
amylase, and lipase, which degrade organic 
materials like complex carbohydrates, lipids, and 
proteins present in the organic biomass into more 
simple compounds such as sugars. During the 
second stage of acidifi cation, fermentative acidproducing bacteria, such as Anaerovibrio lipolytica, 
Bacteroides amylophilus, Bacteriodes ruminocola, 
and so on, convert the simplifi ed compounds into 
volatile fatty acids, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide. 
In this process, the facultative anaerobic bacteria 
utilize oxygen and carbon, thereby creating 
anaerobic conditions necessary for methanogenesis. 
In the fi nal stage, obligate anaerobes, which are 
archaebacteria and mainly include Methanosarcina 
barkeri, Methanococus mazei, and Methanothrix 
soengenii, decompose low molecular weight 
compounds (acetic acid, hydrogen, carbon 
dioxide) to form biogas, sometimes also referred 
to as ‘gobar’ gas. This gas consists of methane 
and carbon dioxide, along with some traces of 
other gases, notably hydrogen sulphide. The exact 
composition will vary according to the substrate 
used in the methanogenesis process, but as an 
approximate guide, when cattle dung is a major 
constituent of fermentation, the composition of 
the resulting gas will be 55%–66% methane, 40%–
45% carbon dioxide, and a negligible amount of 
hydrogen sulphide and hydrogen. 
Factors affecting methanogenesis 
The anaerobic microbial conversion of organic 
substrates to methane is a complex biogenic process 
or salinity, nutrients, and toxic or inhibitory 
substrates. Among all these, the most crucial 
parameter is temperature, as methanogenesis is 
strongly temperature dependent, with reaction 
rates generally increasing with the increase in 
temperature. The most optimum temperature 
range for gas production is 30–35 °C (mesophilic), 
below which the digestion process slows down, 
with little gas produced at a temperature of 
15 °C and less. Therefore, in areas that witness 
temperature fl uctuation, such as mountainous 
regions, temperatures have to be maintained by 
providing heat or increasing insulation to prevent 
heat losses. The hydrogen ion concentration, or the 
pH, is another important factor, as most anaerobic 
conversion processes operate best at near neutral 
pH. Excess production and accumulation of acidic 
or basic conversion products such as organic 
fatty acids or ammonia lead to pH fl uctuations 
outside the optimal range, thereby displacing the 
bicarbonate buffer system that has more neutral 
pH, thus inhibiting methanogenesis. Methane 
formation is also affected by the quantity of daily 
feeding (loading rate) and the retention period of 
the feedstock in a biogas plant. The loading rate 
and retention period are optimized, depending on 
the nature of the feedstock and climatic conditions. 
A high loading rate that is more than the rated 
capacity will form excessive acids, leading to low 
rate of gas formation and production of undigested 
slurry. The retention period for most plants ranges 
between 30 days and 55 days, and is found to 
reduce if temperatures are raised or more nutrients 
are added to the digester. The optimum nutrient 
requirement is generally 20–30 C/N ratio. The 
presence of trace elements like iron, magnesium, 
calcium, sodium, barium, tungsten, and nickel 
activates the enzyme systems of acetogenic and 
methanogenic bacteria and results in higher gas 
production, while heavy metals like mercury, lead, 
chromium, and sulphites, if present, are toxic to 
the anaerobic process.cycle, gas storage system, digester position and size, 
and feed material. The process can be a continuous, 
semi-continuous or batch type. In the batch type, 
the loading of digester is done periodically, and 
after a fall in the gas production, the digester is 
unloaded and recharged. This is suitable for crop 
and forest waste, agro-industrial waste, and other 
waste that does not mix homogeneously with 
water. In a semi-continuous digester, feeding is 
done once in three to four days, and the digester 
is suitable for cattle dung, crop residues, forest 
waste, and so on. Continuous digesters are more 
suitable for regularly and suffi ciently available 
waste that can be mixed homogeneously, such as 
cattle dung and night soil. 
 A typical biogas plant consists of a digester 
in which the slurry (dung mixed with water) is 
fermented; an inlet tank, which is used to mix the 
feed and from where it is passed into the digester; 
a gas holder/dome in which the generated gas 
is collected; an outlet tank to remove the spent 
slurry; distribution pipeline(s) to take the gas to 
the kitchen; and a manure pit in which the spent 
slurry is stored. Based on the gas storage system, 
there are two main digester designs: the fl oating 
dome and the fi xed dome. In the fl oating dome 
biogas plant, also known as the KVIC model, the 
biogas is stored in a drum that can be made of 
steel, ferro-cement or fi bre glass. Based on the 
quantity of the gas stored in it, the drum moves 
up and down on a guide frame, which is fi xed in 
digester walls. In the fi xed dome type, the digester 
and gas storage dome are integrated with the space 
for storing usable gas between the dome and the 
digester, and the most common design is the 
Deenbandhu model.
 While the Deenbandhu model is appropriate 
and more suitable for individual family-type 
requirements, the large-sized fl oating dome KVIC 
design biogas plants have been successfully adopted 
for cattle dung, night soil, kitchen and domestic 
waste, vegetable market waste, and so on (Figure 
7). While the ministry continues to promote 
individual cattle dung based family-type biogas 
plants under its National Biogas Programme, an 
approach for promoting medium-sized biogas 
plants for small communities (six to eight families)

Designs for alternative feedstock 
In rural areas, it is a common practice to use 
cattle dung and night soil as feedstocks in biogas 
plants that meet the cooking energy requirements. 
However, the availability of cattle dung in rural 
areas is limited, and the cattle population is also 
diminishing fast. Hence, there is a need to use 
alternative feedstocks for meeting the increasing

in villages, also have the potential, which can be 
tapped through appropriate technology for energy 
generation, thus, meeting the increasing cooking 
energy demand. So, the production of biogas from 
other biomass like leafy waste, agro-residues, and 
kitchen waste garbage is an attractive option, which 
will facilitate extending the benefi ts of biogas 
technology to a larger section of the society. It is 
estimated that the total potential of leafy biomass 
production in India is of the order of 1130 million 
tonnes (MT) (dry). If even 10% of this biomass 
could be mobilized for biomass production, about 
67% of the rural families could be provided with 
biogas for cooking. After years of R&D efforts, 
different designs have been developed in order to 
harness the biogas potential of such substrates. 
TERI’S ENHANCED ACIDIFICATION AND 
METHANATION PROCESS
TERI’s Enhanced Acidifi cation and Methanation, 
or TEAM, reactor is a biphasic design, which 
is operational since the past four years at Gual 
Pahari, Haryana (Figure 8). Main features of this 
design reactor are as follows.

The acid reactor is daily fed with waste in serial 
order and submerged in water for microbial 
action. The water is re-sprinkled thrice a day for 
15 minutes over the waste bed. Percolate rich in 
volatile fatty acid is collected from the bottom of 
the reactor after six days and is fed to the methane 
reactor. The effl uent discharged from the methane 
reactor is recycled to the acid reactor for drawing 
more acid-rich liquor from the waste. A biphasic 
plant based on the similar principle is operational 
at Maharashtra Scooters for treating 300 kg/
day of canteen waste generated in their campus 
canteen.

In plug fl ow digesters, freshly fed biomass 
feedstock in the slurry form undergoes about three 
to fi ve days of rapid decomposition while being 
submerged under the digester liquid. This removes 
the problematic volatile fatty acid producing 
constituents. After this phase, methanogens 
adequately colonize the partially decomposed 
biomass. The biomass acquires buoyancy at 
this stage and fl oats above the fermenter liquid. 
The rate of acidogenesis and methanogenesis is 
adequately balanced, which produces biogas. Two 
plants of capacities 60 × 4 m3
 and 60 × 6 m3 are 
operational near Kannati, Chikkamangalur, for 
treating coffee waste water. These are being run 
for eight months with leafy biomass and for the 
balance three months as biomass-supported fi xed

The conventional biogas KVIC design has been 
modifi ed in two ways. First, by introducing a 5-
HP mixer to process the waste before putting it 
into a pre-digester tank, and second, by using 
thermophilic microbes for faster digestion of the 
waste. The growth of thermophiles in the predigester tank is ensured by mixing the waste with 
hot water and maintaining the temperature in the 
range of 55–60 °C by using solar heater. From 
the predigester tank, the slurry enters the main 
tank, where it undergoes anaerobic digestion. The 
undigested ligno-cellulosic and hemi-cellulosic 
material then enters the settling tank. Manure is 
dug out from the settling tanks about a month 
later. The gas generated in the plant is used for 
cooking in the nearby canteen/hostel and also for 
gas-based lights fi tted around the plant.

$While large grid-connected wind 
farms are now common in many 
countries, small wind machines are 
also developing their own niche in 
the renewable energy sector. 
 Typically, small wind machines of capacity up 
to 100 kW are called small wind machines. Small 
wind energy systems are of the following types.
Mechanical pumping systems 
Battery charging aero-generators of capacities 
less than 100 kW

SMALL WIND MACHINES
Energy is the prime mover of economic growth 
and human development, which encompass all 
#
#
#
sectors of the economy. However, the production 
and use of fossil fuels for power generation, 
industrial application, and transportation have 
been associated with adverse local environmental 
impacts such as deforestation, land degradation, 
and water and air pollution. In addition, there are 
concerns about the release of greenhouse (GHG) 
emission from the energy sector, particularly 
during power generation using fossil fuels. One 
strategy to address these environmental issues 
and diversifying sources of energy supply at the 
same time is the development and promotion of 
renewable energy technologies. 
 During the past two decades, considerable 
efforts have been made towards large-scale 
penetration of renewable energy technologies in 
India. Grid-connected power generation through 
wind energy in the country has 
crossed the 9521 MW mark, making 
India the fourth largest wind power 
generating country in the world 
after Germany, Spain, and USA. At 
the end of 2006, worldwide capacity 
of wind-powered generators was 
73.9 gigawatts, although it currently 
produces just over 1% of worldwide 
electricity use. 
Wind energy
All renewable energy (except tidal 
and geothermal power), including 
the energy in fossil fuels, ultimately 
comes from the sun. The sun 
radiates 174 423 000 000 000 kWh 
FIGURE 1 WIND FARM USING SMALL WIND MACHINES
Source Unitron, India
Small wind systemsconverted into wind energy, which is about 50 to 
100 times more than the energy converted into 
biomass by all plants on earth. 
 Wind is a form of solar energy and is created 
by the unequal heating of the earth’s surface by 
the sun. During the day, the air above the land 
heats up more quickly than the air over water. 
The warm air over land expands and rises, and 
the heavier, cooler air rushes in to take its place, 
creating winds. At night, the winds are reversed 
because the air cools more rapidly over land than 
over water. In the same way, the large atmospheric 
winds that circle the earth are created because the 
land near the earth’s equator is heated more by the 
sun compared to the land near the North Pole and 
South Pole. 
 The terms ‘wind energy’ and ‘wind power’ 
describe the process by which the wind is used 
to generate mechanical power, or electricity. Wind 
turbines convert the kinetic energy in the wind 
into clean electricity. Wind power uses the kinetic 
energy of the fl owing air to generate mechanical 
energy in a wind turbine, which can be transformed 
into pollution-free electricity. 
 Air moves around the earth because of the 
existing differences in temperature and atmospheric 
pressure. Wind turbines harness the movement 
of the air to produce energy. The wind turns the 
blades, which turn a rotor shaft. This produces 
mechanical power, which is used to drive an 
electric generator. When the wind spins the blades 
of the wind turbine, a rotor captures the kinetic 
energy of the wind and converts it into rotary 
motion to drive the generator. Most turbines have 
automatic overspeed-governing systems to keep 
the rotor from spinning out of control in very high 
winds. Flow chart given in Figure 2 shows the 
steps of generation of energy from wind and its 
distribution.
Wind turbine types
Modern wind turbines fall into two basic groups: 
the horizontal axis type such as the traditional 
farm windmills used for pumping water and the 
vertical axis type such as the egg-beater-style 
Darrieus model, named after its French inventor. 
Most large modern wind turbines are horizontal 
axis turbines.
Horizontal axis
Most wind machines that are in operation today 
are the horizontal axis type. Horizontal axis wind 
machines have blades that resemble airplane 
propellers. A typical horizontal wind machine 
stands as tall as a 20-storied building and has three 
blades that span across 200 feet. 
Vertical axis
Vertical axis wind machines have blades that span 
from the top to the bottom, and the most common 
type (Darrieus wind turbine) looks like a giant 
two-blade egg beater. This type of vertical wind 
machine is typically 100 feet tall and 50 feet wide. 
These machines are available in the capacity size 
of 650 watts to 2 MW for onshore application. For 
offshore application, 5-MW capacity wind turbine 
is commercially available. 
 Horizontal and vertical axis wind turbines are 
presented in Figure 3, and the internal structure 
of a horizontal axis turbine is given in Figure 4.
 Almost all wind turbine generators consist of 
rotor blades, which rotate around a horizontal 
hub. The hub is connected to a gearbox and a 
generator, which are located inside a nacelle. 
The nacelle houses electrical components and is 
mounted at the top of a tower.
FIGURE 2 GENERATION OF WIND ENERGY AND ITS 
DISTRIBUTIONTurbine components
Horizontal turbine components include the 
following. 
A blade or a rotor, which converts the energy in 
the wind to rotational shaft energy. 
A drive train, usually including a gearbox and 
a generator. 
A tower that supports the rotor and drive 
train. 
Other equipment, including controls, electrical 
cables, ground support equipment, and 
interconnection equipment. 
The formula for calculating power from a wind 
turbine is

from 0.25 to 0.45, dimensionless (theoretical 
maximum = 0.59)
ρ = air density, lb/ft3
A = rotor swept area, ft2
 or (π D2 )/4 (D is the 
rotor diameter in feet, π = 3.1416)
V = wind speed, mph
k = 0.000133, a constant to yield power in 
kilowatt (multiplying the above kilowatt by 1.340 
converts it to horsepower [that is, 1 kW = 1.340 
horsepower]).
To get a preliminary estimate of the performance 
of a particular wind turbine, the following formula 
is used. 
 AEO = 0.01328 *D2* V3
where, AEO = annual energy output, kWh/year
D = rotor diameter, feet
V = annual average wind speed, mph
Basic parts of small wind electric system
Small wind energy systems for home lighting 
generally comprise a rotor, a generator or an 
alternator mounted on a frame, a tail, a tower, 
wiring, and the balance of system components, 
controllers, inverters, and/or batteries (Figure 5). 
Through the spinning blades, the rotor captures 
the kinetic energy of the wind and converts it into 
rotary motion to drive the generator.

a hybrid system. For a residential grid-connected 
application, the balance of system parts may 
include a controller, storage batteries, a powerconditioning unit (inverter), and wiring. 
Stand-alone systems
Stand-alone systems (systems not connected to 
the utility grid) require batteries to store excess 
power generated for use when the wind is calm. 
They also need a charge controller to keep the 
batteries from overcharging. Small wind turbines 
generate DC (direct current) electricity. In very 
small systems, DC appliances operate directly off 
the batteries. 
Grid-connected systems
In grid-connected systems, the only additional 
equipment required is a power-conditioning 
unit (inverter), which makes the turbine output 
electrically compatible with the utility grid. Figure 
7 depicts the arrangement showing wind turbine

Tower
Wind speed increases with height; therefore, 
the turbine is mounted on a tower. In general, 
the higher the tower, the more power the wind 
system can produce. The tower also raises the 
turbine above the air turbulence and obstructions 
such as hills, buildings, and trees. A general rule 
of thumb is to install the wind turbine on a tower 
with the bottom of the rotor blades at least 30 feet 
(9 metres) above any obstacle that is within 300 
feet (90 metres) of the tower.

Wind speed to operate a turbine
The greater the annual mean wind speed, the better 
a turbine works. In general, most small/micro wind 
turbines start generating electricity when wind 
speeds are in the range of approximately 3–4 m/
s, and most products achieve their maximum, or 
rated, output at a wind speed of 10–12 m/s, which 
is crucial when comparing products. In order to 
measure the annual wind speed, the knowledge 
of prevailing wind and its direction are required 
at the site. 
 In addition to geologic formations, other 
obstacles such as trees, buildings, and hills should 
also be considered. The turbine needs to be sited 
upwind of buildings and trees, and it needs to be 
30 feet above anything to reach the height of 300 
feet. 
 Any site will have different average wind speeds 
at different locations. An assessment of the site 
should include taking into consideration elevated 
structures like hills in the vicinity of the turbine. 
Such sites with elevations are more suitable than 
gullies or the lee side of hills.
 A site where annual mean wind speed is 5 m/s, 
a turbine with a rating of 1 kW and a diameter of 
2.3 m would generate approximately 1200 kWh, 
or units, of electricity per year. For an average 
household to meet all its electricity needs from a 
small wind turbine, a system of 2.5–6 kW would 
be needed, depending on wind speed.
Wind resource assessment
Wind resources vary with the time of day, season, 
elevation, and type of terrain. Wind plays an 
important role in determining success or failure 
of a small wind turbine project. At the same time, 
the cost of assessing wind resources for a smaller 
project can be too high. 
#

#
#
the mean value. For example, on a site where 50% 
of the time wind speed Vav = 12 m/s and 50% of the 
time Vav = 0 m/s, a wind turbine would generate 
much more electricity than that which is on a site 
where 100% of the time wind speed Vav = 6 m/s. 
This is due to the fact that wind energy, in theory, 
is proportional to the cube of the wind speed.
 Wind resource evaluation is a critical element in 
projecting turbine performance at a given site. The 
energy available in a wind stream is proportional 
to the cube of its speed, which means that 
doubling the wind speed increases the available 
energy by a factor of eight. Furthermore, the wind 
resource itself is seldom a steady, consistent fl ow. 
It varies with the time of day, season, height above 
ground, and type of terrain. Proper siting in windy 
locations, away from large obstructions, enhances 
a wind turbine’s performance. 
 In general, annual average wind speed of 5 
m/s (11 miles per hour, or mph) is required for 
grid-connected applications. Annual average wind 
speed of 3–4 m/s (7–9 mph) may be adequate for 
unconnected electrical and mechanical applications 
such as battery charging and water pumping. Wind 
resources exceeding this speed prevail in many 
parts of the world. 
 Wind power density is a useful way to evaluate 
the wind resource available at a potential site. The 
wind power density, measured in watts per square 
metre, indicates how much energy is available at 
the site for conversion by a wind turbine. Wind 
speed generally increases with height above 
ground. Table 1 gives the classes of wind power 
density at 10 m and 50 m elevation.
 Another useful indirect measurement of the 
wind resource includes observing an area’s 
vegetation. Trees, especially conifers or evergreens, 
can be permanently deformed by strong winds. 
This deformity, known as ‘fl agging’, has been 
used to estimate the average wind speed for an 
area. Figure 8 shows different level of fl agging, 
depending on different wind speed levels.Windmill pumps
A windmill pump consists of a wind rotor, a pump, 
and a power transmission mechanism connecting 
the rotor to the pump. The rotor extracts energy 
from the wind and converts it into useful mechanical 
shaft power. A transmission mechanism conveys

in turn transmits power to the pump. The useful 
life of a well-designed windmill pump is expected

Geothermal energy is the natural heat 
of the earth. The earth’s interior heat 
is a result of high temperature dust 
and gas that can be traced to over 
4 billion years ago and is continually regenerated 
from the decay of radioactive elements that occur 
in all rocks.
 From the surface down through the crust, the 
normal temperature gradient (the increase of 
temperature with the increase of depth) in the 
earth’s crust is 17–30 °C per kilometre of depth. 
Below the crust is the mantle, which is made up 
of highly viscous, partially molten rocks that have 
temperature in the range of 650–1250 °C. At the 
earth’s core, which consists of a liquid outer core 
and a solid inner core, temperatures may reach 
4000–7000 °C. 
GEOTHERMAL ENERGY UTILIZATION
Currently, geothermal energy is exploited from 
the underground water stored in permeable rocks. 
This is also called as hydro-thermal system. In this 
process, the water is heated by hot rocks. The heat 
can also be extracted using geothermal heat pumps 
that extract heat directly from the ground.
 In another process, hot rocks are artifi cially 
fractured, and water is circulated between two 
wells – injection and producer wells – which 
are connected to the underground hot water 
reservoir in the rocks. These are known as hot 
dry rock (HDR) systems. Another method, which 
is under investigation, is the exploitation of the 
large quantities of heat stored locally at accessible 
depth in molten rock (magma). This can provide 
high temperature underground water, which 
can provide energy for many applications. These 
applications include district heating, individual 
residential heating, and spa uses.

$ECO-HOUSING AND ECO-FRIENDLY BUILDING 
DESIGN
Eco-house is a house that has minimal environmental 
impact during its construction and operation 
period. During its construction, it causes minimum 
disruption to surroundings. After its construction 
when it becomes habitable, it consumes very less 
electricity. It is naturally lit and ventilated. Energyeffi cient architecture of eco-house ensures the 
reduced consumption of electricity for cooling and 
heating. The plumbing system of eco-house uses less 
water and puts relatively fewer loads on city’s sewage 
system. This is designed giving due consideration 
to solid waste management system, reducing 
the burden on city’s solid waste disposal system. 
Broadly, an eco-house follows six basic principles: 
site planning, energy-effi cient architecture, energyeffi cient systems in the building, use of renewable 
energy, effi cient water management, and solid waste 
management system.
EFFICIENT SITE PLANNING
Overall site planning and design of an ecobuilding integrates all natural principles. These 
give due consideration to preservation and 
conservation of natural features or resources 
present on the site. These resources may include 
trees and vegetation, soil, water, and other natural 
characteristics of the site. The building layout is 
drawn without disturbing trees and vegetation. 
Care is taken to ensure that trees are not disturbed 
by construction activities. The fertile eco-housing 
site is preserved before starting the construction 
process and is utilized again for landscaping of the
new building. During the construction stage, there 
is effi cient management of waste water and solid 
waste. Effi cient waste management plan ensures 
that the entire site is protected from hazardous 
construction waste.
ENVIRONMENT-FRIENDLY AND ENERGYEFFICIENT BUILDING DESIGN
All buildings in eco-housing are designed for 
energy effi ciency. There is an effi cient utilization of 
natural climatic conditions by using passive solar 
design concepts. These design concepts include 
the following.
Orientation and shading Buildings are oriented 
in such a way that there is effi cient use of sunlight 
and wind. Interiors of the properly orientated 
buildings are naturally heated in winters and 
cooled in summers. 
Building layout The building layout is designed 
in such a way that the rooms have naturally 
comfortable environs during their occupancy 
period. For example, if the living room in an 
eco-house is planned to be used extensively 
during afternoons in summers, then its location 
will be planned in such a way that it receives 
suffi cient natural and diffused light so that the 
environment remains cool. 
Window design Effi cient window design 
enhances lighting and ventilation in the building. 
Windows in an eco-house are sized and placed 
according to solar path. During summers, 
only diffused light comes from the window, 
and during winters, warm sunlight fi lters 
through these windows and makes interiors
#
#
#
the buildingsthe sun in harsh summers and from rains in 
monsoons. If the buildings are air-conditioned 
then the window frames of high performance 
windows reduce heat losses and bring down the 
loads on air-conditioners.
Energy- and resource-effi cient technologies in building 
construction An eco-house is constructed with 
effi cient building technologies, which use ecofriendly materials, and less water and power 
during construction.
Low-energy building materials An eco-house 
is constructed with low energy materials. 
Manufacture and transport of building materials 
are very resource and energy intensive. Low 
energy materials comprise materials that are 
locally available and require less energy and 
resources during the construction process. The 
materials that are made from waste or are the 
by-products of some other industry are also 
considered as low energy building materials. 
USE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY IN THE BUILDING
All buildings in eco-housing are fully or partly 
powered by renewable sources of energy. Examples 
are using solar energy for water heating and space 
heating, biogas for cooking, and other renewable 
energies wherever applicable.
USE OF EFFICIENT SYSTEMS IN THE BUILDING
The lighting, cooling, heating, and air-conditioning 
systems are effi ciently designed in the ecohousing. High performance, energy-effi cient, and 
energy-labelled products are commonly used in 
buildings. These appliances are based on the use of 
energy-effi cient technologies and appliances, and 
automatic control systems. Use of such equipment 
reduces energy consumption in the building. For 
example, heat pumps are used for space heating 
and cooling, insulation is used in walls and roofs 
for reducing heat loss, and so on.
EFFICIENT WATER MANAGEMENT IN THE 
BUILDING
Eco-housing emphasizes on water conservation. 
There is signifi cant reduction in water loss and 
#
#
and water effi ciency. Water conservation means 
the preservation and effi cient management of 
water. This includes use of fi xtures that lead to 
conservation of water. Water effi ciency includes 
prevention of wastage, overuse, and exploitation 
of the available resource. 
EFFICIENT WASTE MANAGEMENT IN THE 
BUILDING
Eco-housing emphasizes on solid waste 
management in the building. Solid waste generated 
from households generally reaches the city 
dumping sites. There is no resource recovery in 
most of the cases. In general, the household waste 
generated constitutes various materials such as 
plastics, paper, and glass that can be recycled and 
reused. In addition, the waste has a high organic 
content, which can be used to recover useful 
resources such as energy and manure. Solid waste 
management in a building would also ensure safe 
and environment-friendly disposal of waste.
 Bhutan has developed its own traditional 
housing and building design guidelines, which 
are being followed strictly. Traditionally, locally 
made mud bricks and conventional housing 
construction techniques using bamboo and 
mud are still used in rural areas. However, the 
use of cement and concrete for construction in 
urban areas and the use of GI sheets for roofi ng 
material are prevalent. In the context of Bhutan, 
following recommendations to develop and adopt 
eco-friendly and energy-effi cient housing codes 
and concepts can be considered
National-level awareness programmes and 
capacity-building programmes for common 
citizens and architects need to be developed.
Agencies like the Standards and Quality Control 
Authority (SQCA), National Housing Board, 
Association of Construction Contractors, 
National environment Commission, Ministry 
of Works and Human Settlement, Urban 
Development Department, and so on can work 
together. 
#

Capacity building will include vesting nationallevel authorities with following responsibilities.
 To govern the construction activities taking 
place in the country. 
 To guide and monitor the local development 
authorities for energy-effi cient building 
techniques.
 To study, analyse, and document the local 
architecture and locally available materials, 
and explore and identify energy effi ciency 
techniques in the buildings.
 To explore energy-effi cient techniques and 
their implications in contemporary era. 
 To develop new building technologies.
 To develop building codes for energy 
effi ciency. 
 To collaborate with international architects 
for advisory services.
Collaborative programmes with other agencies, 
especially with the Government of India 
agencies like the Bureau of Energy Effi ciency 
(BEE) to develop database for weather data, 
best practices, design norms for Bhutanese 
weather conditions, alternative materials, and 
so on can be developed.

ACTION POINTS
Study on buildings and materials and 
development of database for modifying building 
codes to incorporate energy effi ciency and 
sustainability in buildings. 
Pilot projects to demonstrate energy-effi cient 
technologies, design practices, and low energy 
materials. These projects can be taken up 
under the ongoing government projects like 
construction of housing colonies and school 
buildings. This would lead to the development of 
guidelines for such type of projects. The Ministry 
of Environment and Forests, Government of 
India, has prepared similar guidelines, which can 
be accessed at <http://envfor.nic.in/divisions/ 
iass/Construction_Manual.pdf>.

#THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY 
The Department of Energy (DoE) is a central 
government agency responsible for the formulation 
of policies, plans, programmes, and guidelines 
related to the energy sector. Formed in 2002, it 
deals with all forms of energy, including hydropower 
and alternative forms of energy. It also provides 
technical advice to the Royal Government of 
Bhutan on all aspects related to energy, including 
formulating development strategy, monitoring and 
evaluating implementation plans, and preparing 
and maintaining programmes and schedules. It 
is also responsible for giving techno-economic 
and budgetary clearances to major projects and 
programmes related to energy.
 The responsibilities of the DoE are increasing 
over the period. It is assumed that it will 
play increasingly important role in the overall 
development of the energy sector. Therefore, 
there is a need to strengthen and reorganize the 
DoE. The responsibilities of the DoE are likely to 
expand and include activities that can be classifi ed/
categorized under various divisions, as discussed 
subsequently.
 The DoE has four divisions—the Planning 
and Coordination Division (PCD), Hydro-Met 
Services Division (HMSD), and Renewable 
Energy Division (RED). Additionally, the Bhutan 
Electricity Authority (BEA) is also under the 
DoE. 
Planning and Coordination Division
This division is looking after the overall planning 
and coordination work. Besides planning and 
coordination of internal activities, it also coordinates 
donor-funded projects handled by the DoE. Major 
tasks handled by this division are as follows.
Complete planning of the energy sector.
Planning and preparing detailed project reports 
for new projects.
Executing new projects.
Negotiating with the Government of India and 
other funding agencies.
Coordinating with donor-funded projects. 
Coordinating and monitoring with Bhutan 
Power Company, other power generating 
companies, and other stakeholders.
Coordinating with other ministries.
Hydro-Met Service Division
The HMSD has three sections: hydrology, fl ood 
warning, and meteorology. 
 The fl ood warning section monitors fl ood 
warning stations established across the country 
and coordinates with the Government of India 
on fl ood warning data collection and information 
sharing. The hydrology section is responsible for 
the collection and analysis of hydrology data for 
hydropower plant design. 
 The meteorological section is responsible for 
collection and processing of meteorological data. 
It has set up 72 weather stations across the country 
and has a repository of the weather data for last few 
years. The division also maintains fl ood warning 
systems, which are established in coordination 
with India.

for small and micro hydro projects (four projects 
are being studied), development of improved cook 
stoves and bukharis in collaboration with Austrian 
Development Agency, rehabilitation of solar 
photovoltaic systems, development of servicing 
and training network, and so on. The division has 
also worked on developing the draft renewable 
energy policy.

MODELS FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THEIR 
USEFULNESS AND LIMITATIONS WITH RESPECT 
TO BHUTAN
Various fi nancial and business models, which 
are successfully used in market-based country 
situation for delivering solar photovoltaic systems 
are as follows.
Direct Cash Sales Model
The consumer buys the renewable energy 
system by either paying cash or by arranging 
the dealer credit.
$
$
$
$
$
$
#Credit Sales Model
The model involves a specialist fi nance partner, 
along with a maintenance contract during the 
fi nance term.
End-user acquires the renewable energy system 
on credit. Credit sales are divided into three 
categories. 
 1 Dealer Credit Model On receiving all the 
payments for an renewable energy system 
through credit arrangements, renewable 
energy dealer/ supplier sells renewable 
energy system/s to end-user and the enduser immediately becomes the owner of the 
system. 
 2 End-user Credit Model After providing third 
party consumer credits to the end-user, 
renewable energy dealer/supplier sells the 
renewable energy system to the end-user. 
Usually, the end-user becomes the owner 
of the system immediately, but this can be 
delayed until all the payments are made. 
The renewable energy system is used as a 
collateral against the loan.
 3 Lease/Hire Purchase Model The solar 
photovoltaic supplier/dealer or a fi nancial 
intermediary leases the photovoltaic system/s 
to an end-user. At the end of the lease period, 
ownership may or may not be transferred to 
the end-user, depending on the agreement. 
During the lease period, the leaser remains 
the owner of the system and is responsible 
for its maintenance and repair. 
Fee-for-Service Model
A large-scale ‘utility–type’ approach that usually 
involves providing subsidies to users.
An energy service company (ESCO) owns the 
system and provides energy service to end-user, 
who pays a periodic fee (for example, monthly) 
to ESCO.
The end-user is not responsible for the 
maintenance of the system and never becomes 
the owner.
#
#
#
#
#
Model, with the only difference being the 
concession availed to serve specifi ed region with 
some degree of monopoly.
Concessionaire and regulatory-type model 
approach to rural electrifi cation is being tested 
in many countries and maybe more suitable for 
rural off-grid electrifi cation.
Rural Energy Service Concession Model
Bhutan has developed Rural Energy Service 
Concession Model (RESCOM), which is a 
combination of Fee-for-Service Model and 
Concession Model. 
 With this approach, consumer would not be 
required to make his own payment, and quality 
of services is systematically assured. This modifi ed 
model also enables the development of market for 
renewable energy technologies by creating a critical 
mass essential for making commercially sustainable 
business. Rural energy service provider operator 
will be selected through bidding for it to have 
concessional exclusive rights, being technically and 
fi nancially qualifi ed service provider for a specifi c 
region for a specifi c period of time. 
 By effective application of RESCOM, Bhutan 
is planning off-grid electrifi cation of 4000-8000 
households by 2013. 
Getana Model
The Getana Model has been implemented by the 
Department of Energy (DoE) with the purpose 
of demonstrating a scheme for community-based 
solar photovoltaic energy services. Figure 1 shows 
the framework and other details of the Getana 
Model.
HYDROPOWER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
The recently released Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment reports 
have established the phenomenon of global 
warming beyond any doubt. The climate change 
may bring about a tremendous impact on the 
high mountainous glacial environment like that in 
Bhutan. Many of the big glaciers melt and form 
glacial lakes. The global warming induces faster 
#rate of ice and snow melting, leading to a rapid level 
rise in these lakes. The sudden discharge of large 
volumes of water and debris from the glacial lakes 
– known as glacial lake outburst fl ood (GLOF) 
– could cause fl ooding downstream. The GLOF 
can severely damage hydropower plants. This had 
happened in Nepal in 1985 when the Dig Tsho 
GLOF destroyed the Namche small hydropower 
project. 
 It is recommended, therefore, to set up ‘Glacial 
Lake Outburst Flood Monitoring and Early 
Warning System’ to continuously monitor the 
likely GLOF hazards and take early preventive 
actions. Towards this end, Bhutan may work with 
the United Nations Environment Programme 
(UNEP); the International Center for Integrated 
Mountain Development (ICIMOD), Nepal; 
National Remote Sensing Agency, India; and Asian 
Institute of Technology, Bangkok. Such a system 
would also help in assessing the environmental 
condition of the high mountainous regions. 
THE ‘DUTCH DISEASE’
As detailed elsewhere in this report, the export 
of hydropower is the mainstay of the Bhutanese 
economy. In a classic economic parlance, such 
a situation might lead to ‘Dutch disease’. A 
natural resource-based export boom can cause 
major distortions in an economy by discouraging 
production and investment in the non-booming 
exportables sector, often referred to as ‘Dutch 
disease’.1
 However, the studies show that there 
is no evidence of a stagnation of the non-power 
tradable sector so far. 
 Nonetheless, it would be prudent to take the 
necessary preventive measures. Given the fact 
that Bhutan is blessed with so many natural 
resources that can be utilized both for value-added

small, village-level industries. Such industries can 
be established around decentralized power plants 
based on small hydro, biomass, and solar energy. 
Such an approach would also help in minimizing 
the migration of the rural populace to cities.
 Besides, taking advantage of cheap and abundant 
electricity, clean environment, and the educated 
youth, Bhutan may establish itself as a hub for 
service-oriented exports (for example, software, 
business, and knowledge process outsourcing). 
This may fetch much more revenue than the plain 
exports of electricity. Needless to say, this would 
also result in the creation of job opportunities for 
the local youth.

 MDGs were drawn from the actions and targets 
present in the Millennium Declaration that was 
adopted by 189 nations during the UN Millennium 
Summit held in September 2000. 
 Eight MDGs and their 18 quantifi able targets, 
along with their 48 trackable indicators that were 
adopted by the UN, can also be compared with 
the targets and goals set by the Royal Government 
of Bhutan (RGoB). Table 1 gives a glimpse of the 
goals and targets of the MDGs.

 GNH is based on the belief that the pursuit of 
happiness is the inherentt desire of every human 
being, and that of every citizen of the kingdom. The 
concept suggests a much broader, comprehensive, 
and balanced approach to development. 
 The operationalization of GNH, which 
entailed transposing cultural, social, spiritual, and 
environmental consciousness into development, 
has been conducted in Bhutan, essentially through 
fi ve year plans.
