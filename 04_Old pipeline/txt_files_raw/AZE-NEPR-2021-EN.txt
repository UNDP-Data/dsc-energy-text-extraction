AGENCYFOREW
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has been conducting in-depth peer reviews of the 
energy policies of its member countries – and of other countries – since 1976, and it 
recently modernised these reviews to focus on some of the countries’ key energy transition 
and security challenges. 
Azerbaijan is one of the focus countries of the EU4Energy programme, which is carried 
out by the IEA and the European Union along with the Energy Community Secretariat and 
the Energy Charter Secretariat. The other EU4Energy focus countries are Armenia, 
Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine 
and Uzbekistan. The programme is designed to support the goals and aspirations of the
11 focus countries to implement sustainable energy policies and foster co-operative 
energy sector development at the regional level. As part of this programme, the IEA 
conducts in-depth reviews of each focus country.
Azerbaijan’s oil and gas production continues to support the country’s economy and 
energy supply and provide most of its exports and government revenue. However, many 
major oil and gas importing countries have recently pledged to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions to net zero by mid-century, adding an extra element of uncertainty to the longterm economic outlook for countries like Azerbaijan that are heavily dependent on 
hydrocarbon exports.
To help Azerbaijan respond to its energy sector challenges, this report proposes several 
ways it can make both its energy supply and consumption more efficient and diverse. The 
review recommends that Azerbaijan transition gradually from its current system – which is 
government-owned and -operated, vertically integrated, and subsidised – to competitive 
markets with significant private sector participation and cost-covering energy prices. The 
withdrawal of subsidies should, however, be accompanied by support measures for the 
country’s economically vulnerable citizens. Such a transition would attract new market 
entrants and new investments, including to develop Azerbaijan’s significant solar and wind 
energy resources. These measures would also help limit greenhouse gas emissions.
This in-depth review aims to guide Azerbaijan in its energy sector reforms and help it
achieve its energy policy goals of making the most of its abundant resources and providing 
affordable, secure and clean energy to its population.

1. Executive summary
Oil and gas exports continue to dominate Azerbaijan’s economy and provide the majority 
of government revenue. Although they are plentiful, the long-term outlook for fossil fuel 
resources (and therefore for government revenue) is becoming uncertain in light of recent 
commitments by major importing countries to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions by 2050. 
This report proposes several ways to increase the efficiency of domestic energy supply 
and usage to respond to this challenge. In essence, it recommends that Azerbaijan 
transitions gradually from its current system – which is government-owned and -operated, 
vertically integrated and subsidised – to competitive markets with significant private sector 
participation and cost-covering energy prices. Of course, subsidy withdrawal would need 
to be accompanied by support measures for financially vulnerable citizens. Such a 
transition would help diversify the economy away from oil and gas exports while attracting 
new market entrants and new investments, including in renewable energy. These 
measures would also help reduce GHG emissions.
These recommendations actually support efforts that are already under way. Prompted by 
the oil price shock of 2014-2015, the government recently drafted several reform 
proposals, and many new laws are awaiting approval. Laws governing the electricity and 
gas sectors since the 1990s will be revised, and specific legislation on energy efficiency 
and renewable energy will be introduced. In addition, the country’s first specific energy 
strategy is nearing completion. The government has furthermore decided to diversify 
foreign direct investment away from oil and gas and towards infrastructure and industry,
and it has already taken steps to improve Azerbaijan’s investment climate.
Scaling down the long-term importance of oil and gas
Oil and natural gas bring in around 90% of Azerbaijan’s export revenues, and they finance 
around 60% of the government budget. They also supply 98% of primary energy and more 
than 90% of the country’s electricity. Oil and, more recently, gas have been largely 
responsible for the remarkable rise in living standards in Azerbaijan since the late 1990s. 
Azerbaijan has succeeded in creating a stable upstream oil and gas investment climate 
and has become an important and reliable oil and gas exporter. A major achievement of 
international significance is the recently completed Southern Gas Corridor (SGC) that 
supplies gas from Azerbaijan’s Shah Deniz 2 field to Europe through Turkey. The SGC 
gives Azerbaijan a new source of gas export revenues while helping Europe diversify its 
gas supply routes and improve gas security as its domestic production continues to 
 All rights reserved.Although oil and gas will remain major sources of wealth for Azerbaijan in the short and 
medium terms, two factors in particular indicate a less important role for them in the long 
term. The first is that oil production, which dates to the mid-19th century, has been in 
decline since 2010. Although natural gas production, which became significant in the 
2000s, continues to increase, total export revenues are falling due to lower oil production. 
The oil price shocks of 2014-2015 and 2020 highlighted the risks of short-term fuel price 
fluctuations and strengthen the case for further long-term efforts to diversify the economy. 
Second, the emerging global push for clean energy will inevitably affect oil and gas 
demand. Several of the world’s largest energy importers (the European Union, Japan and 
South Korea) have recently pledged to reduce GHG emissions to net-zero by 2050, and 
China is aiming for the same by 2060. These targets therefore imply little demand for oil 
or gas without carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) three decades from now. 
Technology breakthroughs and policy changes may further accelerate this transition, and 
competition for export opportunities among producing countries may well intensify, 
increasing the risk of many oil and gas assets becoming stranded. 
Managing the costs of new developments is crucial to Azerbaijan’s future success as an 
internationally competitive producer, and reducing the carbon footprint of production is also 
likely to be necessary. The State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR), the 
country’s national oil company, is targeting to eliminate gas flaring completely in 2021 and 
is also successfully working to reduce methane emissions. The potential of using CCUS 
to enhance oil recovery and produce hydrogen from natural gas should also be studied. 
The IEA encourages the government to continue working closely with the leading oil and 
gas sector companies operating in the country to reduce sectoral emissions.
The government has recognised the need to reduce economic dependence on oil and gas 
exports. Efforts to modernise and increase oil refining and petrochemical production have 
been successful and continue to produce improvements. SOFAZ, the State Oil Fund of 
the Republic of Azerbaijan, could stimulate further diversification. 
A path to a more efficient, dynamic and sustainable 
energy system
It is critical to increase efficiency, attract new entrants and investments, and diversify the 
energy supply in Azerbaijan’s current energy system in which gas, electricity and heat are 
supplied by financially burdened monopolies at strongly subsidised prices. Policy 
responses should therefore include energy tariff reform, electricity and gas market reform, 
greater renewable energy use and higher energy efficiency.
 
[1] IEA (2020), Gas 2020. 
 All rights reserved.ENERGY INS
The tariff system includes cross-subsidies between consumer groups and energy carriers 
as well as direct subsidies from the state budget. The low price of natural gas in particular 
creates distortions. For example, it discourages the use of renewable energy for electricity
production and, as it favours individual gas boilers for space heating, it inhibits the use of 
potentially more efficient system solutions such as district heating and cooling, electricity 
and heat pumps. Low oil prices meanwhile encourage the use of large, inefficient cars that 
are often acquired second-hand, and the effects of this may intensify as car ownership 
becomes more common.
Subsidised tariffs do not encourage residential and industrial consumers to use energy 
more efficiently, even though it would make economic sense for the country as a whole. 
Tariff reform should therefore be central to Azerbaijan’s energy sector reform efforts. The 
oil and gas saved through improved efficiency or through substitution by renewable energy 
could be exported at much higher prices or turned into higher-value-added petrochemicals. 
Furthermore, the GHG emissions avoided would help the country meet its Paris 
Agreement climate target (see below).
To reduce subsidies in the longer term, more emphasis should be placed on explaining to 
the public that blanket energy subsidies are a highly regressive measure that benefits 
mainly the well-off. These subsidies should be phased out gradually and replaced by 
support mechanisms that protect vulnerable groups.
Gas and electricity market reform 
Azerbaijan would also benefit from more dynamic, efficient and environmentally and 
financially sustainable electricity and gas markets. The IEA therefore strongly encourages 
the government to intensify efforts to unbundle monopoly operations, increase competition 
and attract private investment to build new infrastructure and modernise the existing 
system. Reforming the tariff system and phasing out gas subsidies to enable cost recovery 
and fair competition across all power and heat technologies is essential. To ensure that 
reforms are socially acceptable, this complex task requires careful action to protect 
vulnerable consumers. It also requires continuous education and training efforts to 
guarantee that enough people have the planning capabilities and skills necessary to 
deliver the reforms efficiently and effectively. A campaign to improve public awareness of
the reasons for energy policy changes and the benefits of future reforms is also needed. 
Electricity demand in Azerbaijan is set to grow in the years and decades ahead. The whole 
population has access to affordable electricity, and wider electrification is expected to raise 
demand considerably from the currently low 2 500 kilowatt hours (kWh) per capita per 
year. The country needs a more dynamic electricity sector, and investments in new and 
more efficient generating capacity and electricity grids are essential. The IEA welcomes 
the government’s determination to reform the electricity system and gradually move from 
a state-dominated, vertically integrated system to a more dynamic, efficient and 
environmentally sustainable one. The challenge now is to deliver it.
 All rights reserved.country and its economy. 
The government should first focus on the issues of governance and financial viability. 
Tariffs and subsidies should be reformed to enable full cost recovery and encourage 
investments in power sector development, which should help reduce operating costs and 
improve generation, transmission and distribution efficiency. To enable the energy sector 
to allocate resources more efficiently, the IEA furthermore urges the government to reform 
and gradually abolish subsidies for natural gas in electricity generation. The government 
should also focus at the outset on setting specific policy objectives for a secure, efficient 
and clean electricity system. Although Azerbaijan has enough gas resources to generate 
all the electricity it needs for decades to come, it is also in the enviable position of having 
hydropower and significant solar and wind power potential. As solar and wind technology 
costs have declined dramatically in recent years, tapping into their potential would allow 
the country to save its natural gas for export at the same time as reducing domestic GHG 
emissions. 
In this context, the IEA welcomes the government’s ambition to raise the share of 
renewable energy in total generating capacity from 16% in 2018 to 30% in 2030, and 
congratulates it on its first power purchase agreements (PPAs) for a 240-megawatt (MW) 
wind farm, signed in late 2020, and 230 MW of solar power capacity, signed in early 2021. 
When the time comes for the government to consider renewable energy targets beyond 
2030, it should take account of both the economic potential of renewable energy and the 
scope for other policies and measures to meet energy policy goals. Cost-effectiveness 
should be a key criterion for choosing among policy options: for example, it may be less 
costly to meet longer-term energy policy goals by increasing energy efficiency than by 
building new generating capacity. 
To meet electricity market reform objectives, policies and measures must provide for 
unbundling, third-party access to grids, transparent wholesale markets, and partial 
privatisation of monopolies. It follows that Azerenergy’s generating assets should be 
effectively unbundled from its transmission grid ownership and grid operations. At the 
same time, transmission and distribution tariffs should be separated from energy supply 
tariffs to enable the use of performance-based incentives, while electricity generation 
should be opened up to competition and wholesale and retail markets created. There is a 
strong case for undertaking such a broad and complex reform gradually. The first step 
should be to remove entry barriers for new participants and begin to institute unsubsidised 
cost-based economic dispatch of power plants to increase efficiency. This should be quite 
feasible, since – aside from autoproducers – almost all generating capacity is owned by 
Azerenergy.
To increase competition, some of Azerenergy’s generating assets could be privatised. The 
emphasis should be on privatisation as a means of increasing competition and operational 
efficiency rather than as an end in itself, with full privatisation unlikely to be necessary to 
achieve the desired goals. For example, in many European countries the state remains 
the majority shareholder in electricity generators that operate in competitive wholesale 
markets. New entrants could be entirely private or based on public-private partnerships, 
 All rights reserved.ENERGY INS
The establishment of the regulator in 2017 was a major step in electricity market reform. 
Since the Azerbaijan Energy Regulatory Agency (AERA) remains closely overseen by the 
Ministry of Energy, just like the electricity sector monopolies Azerenergy and Azerishiq, it 
will be essential to grant it the legal right to take binding decisions and issue 
recommendations. This also applies to its work in natural gas and district heating. 
Securing larger electricity supplies 
Having an uninterrupted supply of electricity is critical for a modern society. In their efforts 
to ensure electricity security, many IEA member countries have found it useful to put in 
place a comprehensive framework, supported by laws, regulations, policies and measures 
that address generation, transmission, distribution and supply challenges. The IEA urges 
Azerbaijan to consider a similar framework approach that takes account of electricity 
infrastructure needs and long-term network development. The government should ensure 
that it has sufficient personnel qualified to carry out the tasks required under the 
framework. It should also organise emergency response exercises, as they have proven 
effective in boosting preparedness and response capability in other countries. 
An electricity security framework should cover the areas of fuel security, resource 
adequacy, operational security and governance. Azerbaijan’s fuel supply appears secure, 
as the country has significant natural gas resources and is about to diversify by investing 
in renewable energy generation. Resource adequacy is supported both by generating 
capacity that is set to expand and is already able to meet twice the peak demand, and by 
cross-border connections. In addition, efforts to modernise networks are under way to keep 
up with growing network demands. The July 2018 blackouts demonstrated that several 
domains of operational security require improvement, as does the area of governance, 
including legislation, institutions and regulation. Furthermore, the electricity security 
framework should include targets and indicators that are regularly monitored and reviewed 
to measure progress and help ensure that electricity security is maintained and improved. 
Using energy more efficiently 
As other countries with legacy infrastructure and subsidised energy prices, Azerbaijan has 
plenty of scope to improve its energy efficiency. The IEA strongly encourages the 
government to recognise that greater energy efficiency can benefit the economy, reduce 
pollution and create additional jobs, and to rapidly adopt the laws, strategies, policies and 
measures needed to realise this potential. Strong policies on energy efficiency will become 
increasingly relevant because more buildings will be constructed, more appliances and 
equipment sold, and more vehicles purchased in the years and decades ahead. A longterm approach is therefore needed to keep the country on an environmentally sustainable 
energy pathway. 
Instead of subsidising energy use for everyone, the government should focus social policy 
measures on those in real need while gradually switching to more efficient energy use. As 
 All rights reserved.residential and public buildings, would also save energy while benefitting citizen health, 
the case for introducing financing mechanisms for energy-efficient housing is strong. The 
government should also ensure that residential buildings comply with energy efficiency 
regulations. In many IEA countries, compliance is verified by public sector building 
inspectors, which is an approach Azerbaijan’s government should consider.
Experience in IEA member countries shows that minimum energy performance standards 
are among the most effective and cost-efficient energy efficiency policy instruments. The 
government should therefore introduce stringent standards across all sectors to cover 
buildings, vehicles, appliances and equipment. These standards should be underpinned 
by an effective energy efficiency audit mechanism. It should also update the standards 
regularly and, when applicable, accompany them with energy labelling.
Azerbaijan’s population, half of which still lives in the countryside, is expected to continue 
growing, urbanising and becoming wealthier. The country will thus need to build more 
urban infrastructure in the coming decades, including new heating systems. Space heating 
is currently based on individual boilers that burn subsidised gas. However, modern district 
heating and cooling (DHC) systems, combined with more efficient electricity generation, 
heat pumps, waste heat use and thermal storage, could offer a solution that is more 
efficient and cost-effective while reducing CO2 emissions. 
As transport sector oil use more than tripled between 2000 and 2018, energy and climate 
considerations should be integrated into long-term transport and urban development 
policies so that Azerbaijan does not become locked into inefficient and energy-intensive
private car-dominated urban structures. For example, if private car ownership in Azerbaijan 
were to increase to the current European Union (EU) average, the country’s car fleet would 
expand almost fourfold to five million. Expansion of the Baku metro in recent years has 
improved public transport availability, but further replacement of private vehicles with 
public transport, walking and cycling would improve air quality and reduce noise and 
congestion, especially in the Greater Baku area, which is home to almost half the 
population and half the country’s vehicles. 
Tackling the rise in transport fuel demand (unrestrained by prices or taxes) and the hike in 
natural gas use (subsidised in all sectors) is also necessary for Azerbaijan to achieve its 
Paris Agreement goal of reducing net GHG emissions by 35% from 1990 to 2030. In 2018, 
the latest year for which data are available, net GHG emissions were 2.5% above the 2030 
target. Cutting GHG emissions from oil and gas production would also reduce total GHG 
emissions considerably.
Energy research, development and innovation merit

Energy research, development and innovation (RDI) is necessary to help Azerbaijan 
maintain and improve its economic competitiveness, and to enable diversification away

Further energy data improvements 
Reliable data is the basis of sound policymaking. The IEA congratulates the State 
Statistical Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan (SSC) for improving energy efficiency 
data collection and monitoring, and it encourages the SSC to further develop national 
energy statistics to improve data coverage and quality and to inform policy decisions.
Key recommendations 
The government of Azerbaijan should: 
 Finalise laws and plans for which approval is pending as soon as possible, and ensure

Country overview
Located in the southern Caucasus region, the Republic of Azerbaijan (hereafter 
‘Azerbaijan’) is bordered by the Caspian Sea to the east, Armenia and Georgia to the west, 
the Russian Federation (hereafter ‘Russia’) to the north and Iran to the south. The 
Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, the country’s exclave on the southwestern side of 
Armenia, also has a short border with Turkey. Azerbaijan has an area of around 
87 000 km2, and its population of 10.0 million has grown at a rate of around 0.9%/a in 
recent years. Baku is the country’s capital and largest city.
Azerbaijan’s economy is driven by the oil and gas sector, which accounts for around 90% 
of the country’s exports and 30-50% of its GDP, depending on oil prices. Export revenues 
from oil, and increasingly from gas, have brought Azerbaijan significant wealth and raised 
the country’s standard of living. Oil and gas sector dominance has led to heavier economic 
dependence on industry and construction (52.2% of GDP in 2018) than on services 
(34.8%). The dynamics of the oil and gas sector influence economic growth considerably, 
both through industrial activity and consumer spending linked to employment and salaries. 
Agriculture provides 5.2% of GDP, but still almost 40% of all jobs. 
Nominal GDP grew almost ninefold to USD 75 billion from 2004 to 2014, driven by oil and 
gas export revenues (World Bank, 2020a). However, the global oil price collapse of 
2014-2015 forced Azerbaijan to devalue its currency against the USD, and its nominal 
GDP in USD terms dropped by half from 2014 to 2016. The government decided to 
accelerate the implementation of policies to diversify the economy, and in 2016 President 
Ilham Aliyev approved a development policy framework to devise strategic roadmaps for 
the main sectors of the economy. 
 All rights reserved.The 2020 oil price shock reconfirmed the need for private-sector-led and productivitybased development and diversification in Azerbaijan, and recently announced 
decarbonisation targets in a growing number of oil and gas importing countries also point 
to this conclusion. The economy can still be much further diversified, however, and 
dependence on the oil and gas industry is likely to persist for years.
Nevertheless, Azerbaijan is relatively well equipped financially to deal with economic 
challenges. At the end of January 2021, the combined assets of its sovereign wealth fund 
SOFAZ (USD 43.6 billion, mostly very liquid) and the central bank’s foreign exchange 
reserves (USD 6.4 billion) were worth more than 100% of GDP, while at the end of 2019 
government debt amounted to 19% of GDP (CBA, 2021; SOFAZ, 2021; Fitch Ratings, 2020).
The country’s stated objective is to diversify foreign direct investment (FDI) away from oil 
and natural gas (50% of FDI between 2003 and 2017) and towards infrastructure and 
industry (mining, metallurgy and cement). Azerbaijan has significantly improved its 
investment climate by strengthening the institutional, regulatory and operational 
environment for companies. According to the World Bank’s Doing Business report, 
Azerbaijan climbed to 34th out of 190 countries in 2020, up from 57th in 2018 (World Bank, 
2020b).

As Azerbaijan is a major oil and natural gas producer, these two commodities dominate 
the country’s exports and domestic energy supply (Figure 2.2). Overall, Azerbaijan 
produces around four times the energy it consumes and has one of the world’s highest 
levels of energy self-sufficiency. In recent years, it has exported almost 90% of its oil 
production and over 40% of its natural gas.
Azerbaijan’s domestic energy supply (TES) is based on natural gas (66% in 2019) and oil 
(33% in 2019). Natural gas is used to generate most of the country’s electricity and heat 
(over 90% in 2019). Crude oil is refined locally to satisfy most of the nation’s oil product 
consumption, and local production is about to expand following a refinery upgrade that is 
now under way. It is noteworthy that no coal is used in the country.
The residential sector is traditionally the largest final energy consumer, responsible for 
32% of final consumption (TFC) in 2019, with households consuming energy mostly in the 
form of natural gas (80% of total household consumption in 2019). Energy consumption in 
the transport sector, which has more than tripled since 2000, accounted for 26% of TFC 
in 2019, almost all in the form of oil (just under 99% of total transport consumption in 2019). 
Industry was also responsible for around 26% of TFC, with oil as its main energy source 
(50% of the sectoral total in 2019). Services and the primary sector together accounted for 
16% of TFC in 2019, increasingly in the form of natural gas (39% of the sectoral total).
Although the government has not yet prepared long-term energy scenarios examining 
future supply and demand, it is expected to do so when formulating the Long-Term 
Development Strategy of the Energy Sector of the Republic of Azerbaijan under a 
presidential decree of 29 May 2019 on Acceleration of Reforms in the Energy Sector of 
the Republic of Azerbaijan.

TES – dominated by oil and gas – declined rapidly in the first years after the collapse of 
the Soviet Union. It has grown relatively modestly since then (+41% since 2000; Figure 
2.4), with energy efficiency improvements and structural change in the economy largely 
offsetting the impact of increased economic activity. From 2008 (before the global financial 
crisis) to 2019, TES increased only 15% to reach 15.9 Mtoe. Growth resulted mostly from

Executive
Executive power is held by the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, and the president 
assembles a Cabinet of Ministers to organise the work of the executive authorities. The 
Cabinet of Ministers is an executive body accountable directly to the president.
The MoE is the central executive authority responsible for implementing state policy and 
the various regulations, orders and decrees issued by the government for the energy 
sector. The MoE board, approved by the Cabinet of Ministers, has the authority to issue 
orders within its area of competence, meaning most domains within the energy sector 
except tariff regulation, which is under the authority of the Tariff Council.
The Tariff Council determines the retail and wholesale tariffs for electricity, gas, district 
heat and refined petroleum products as well as purchase tariffs for renewable electricity. 
The Minister of Economy is the chairman of the Tariff Council, and members include the 
deputy ministers of Finance, Justice, Energy, Transport, Communication and Information 
Technologies, Agriculture, Health, Education, Labour and Social Defence of the People, 
the vice-chairmen of the committees of Customs and of State City Building and 
Architecture and the deputy chairman of the State Tax Service.
In December 2017, the Azerbaijan Energy Regulatory Agency (AERA) was established 
under the MoE. AERA regulates producers, transmission operators, distributors, suppliers 
and consumers in the fields of electricity, district heat and gas supply; undertakes energy 
market analysis; proposes restructuring measures; and develops the investment climate. 
Eventually, after approval of the draft Law on the Regulator, all functions related to 
calculating and approving energy tariffs will be transferred from the Tariff Council to AERA. 
The draft law was submitted to the Cabinet of Ministries for inter-ministerial consultations 
in July 2019.
In September 2020, the President of Azerbaijan signed a decree establishing the State 
Agency for Renewable Energy Sources. The new agency will report to the MoE.
The Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources is a central executive body implementing 
state policy on environmental protection. It maintains environmental safety, monitors the 
extraction of natural resources and their conservation in the country and takes measures 
to avert damage to natural ecological systems from economic or other activities.
The Ministry of Emergency Situations is responsible for emergency response mechanisms 
in all sectors of the economy. Its mandate includes emergencies arising from natural and 
man-made disasters and fire, as well as emergencies involving power systems, utility 
systems, hydropower facilities, oil and gas production and processing plants and main 
pipelines. 
 All rights reserved.The Azerbaijani legal system is based on civil law and founded on the country’s 
Constitution. International agreements in which Azerbaijan is one of the parties constitute 
an integral part of the legislative system. When there is disagreement between normative 
legal acts (except within the Constitution and acts accepted by way of referendum) and 
international agreements in which Azerbaijan is one of the parties, the provisions of the 
international agreement prevail. 
The legislative body of Azerbaijan is the National Assembly (Milli Məclis in Azerbaijani), a 
unicameral parliament whose 125 deputies are directly elected for a five-year term. The 
most recent elections for the National Assembly were held in February 2020.
Under the Constitution, those having the right to submit drafts of laws and other questions 
for consideration by the National Assembly are: deputies of the National Assembly, the 
President of the Azerbaijan Republic, the Supreme Court, citizens’ groups presenting at 
least 40 000 signatures, the Prosecutor's Office and the National Assembly (Ali Majlis) of 
the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic.
Drafts of laws are submitted to the president for signing within 14 days of their acceptance. 
Laws and decrees of the National Assembly become valid from the date of their publication 
unless otherwise specified within the law or decree.
Main energy legislation 
Azerbaijan’s energy legislation dates mostly from the second half of the 1990s. The 1998 
Law on Energy is a framework law regulating the exploration, development, production, 
processing, storage, transportation, distribution and use of all “energy materials and 
products”. Any person planning to carry out energy activities must obtain special 
permission from the MoE based on an energy contract or an application submitted prior to 
project initiation. 
Article 3 of the 1998 Law on Energy defines Azerbaijan’s energy policy, which includes the 
following objectives: 
 effective production, transportation, distribution, storage, use and safety of energy products 
 creation of infrastructure to efficiently provide energy to all consumers and create new jobs; 
establishment of competition and minimal monopoly conditions in the energy sector; 
organisation of energy sector activities based on various types of ownership, long-term 
contracts and permits; creation of favourable conditions for local businesses producing 
high-quality products; and creation of favourable conditions for the application of efficient 
and environmentally safe technologies 
 conservation of energy resources, waste reduction, efficient energy consumption and the
use of renewable energy sources 
 reduction of negative environmental impacts 
 in case of energy shortages, subsidy provision for producers and consumers to increase 
energy efficiency 
 All rights reserved.ENERGY INS
The 1996 Law on the Use of Energy Resources defines the legal, economic and social 
foundations of state policy in the use of energy resources, as well as general policy 
implementation measures.
The 1998 Law on Subsoil regulates oil and gas exploration, use, protection, safety and 
control in the field of the use of mineral resources, including oil reserves, located in 
Azerbaijan and the Azerbaijani sector of the Caspian Sea shelf. 
The 1998 Law on Gas Supply regulates the production, processing, transportation, 
storage, distribution, sale and use of all types of gas. 
Oil and gas exploration and production projects involving international partners operate 
almost exclusively under production sharing agreements (PSAs), each of which has the 
status of a separate law (see Chapter 3).
The main laws dealing with electricity are the 1998 Law on the Use of Energy Resources, 
the 1998 Law on Electric Power Industry and the 1999 Law on Electricity and Heating 
Plants. Under the 1998 Law on Electric Power Industry and its subsequent revisions, a 
permit is required for the production, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity, as 
well as its import and export, unless otherwise specified by law.
Azerbaijan does not yet have individual laws on renewable energy or energy efficiency, 
but such laws have been drafted and are now (April 2021) being approved.
Key policies and reform efforts 
With oil and natural gas exports being the government’s main source of revenue, the 
energy sector is the driving force behind Azerbaijan’s economic development. Completion 
of the geopolitically important Southern Gas Corridor between Azerbaijan and Europe has 
opened another source of gas export revenue. 
In the domestic energy sector, a major issue is the need to transition from a governmentowned and -operated vertically integrated, subsidised system to competitive markets with 
a large measure of private sector participation. Significant economic and energy efficiency 
potential thus remains untapped.
The country’s energy mix is heavily concentrated on fossil fuels, with oil and gas 
accounting for more than 98% of total supply. While supply security is not a concern, heavy 
fossil fuel reliance results in high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and it also exposes 
the country to fuel price fluctuation risks. In addition, investments are needed to modernise 
ageing infrastructure. 
Along with oil and gas, the electricity sector has a leading role in Azerbaijan’s social and 
economic development. Large investments in power generation and transmission since 
2009 have improved power supply quality remarkably. Electricity generation is now 
sufficient to cover domestic demand, and the power system is capable of supplying 
electricity of acceptable quality to almost the entire population. Setting energy prices at the 
 All rights reserved.deployment has been limited, however, considering the scale of available resources and 
the country’s long-term ambitions. 
Renewable energy, together with energy efficiency, also offers the most promising lowcarbon solution to meet Azerbaijan’s climate targets. In its nationally determined 
contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement, the country committed to reduce its GHG 
emissions 35% from the 1990 level by 2030. The government is also working to meet the 
UN’s 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), among which SDG 7 (access to 
affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy resources) is a priority for Azerbaijan; 
this should synergise with efforts to achieve the Paris Agreement goal.
Reform efforts and planned laws
Azerbaijan established laws for the electricity and gas sectors in the 1990s, but it does not 
yet have specific legislation for areas such as energy efficiency and renewable energy, nor 
does it have an explicit energy strategy. However, the government recently drafted several 
reform proposals and approval is pending for many new laws. They are discussed in more 
detail in the corresponding chapters of this report.
Reform momentum was triggered by the impact of oil price shocks on the national 
economy. Following both the 2007-2008 global financial crisis and the 2014-2015 oil price 
collapse (and resultant sharp oil export revenue losses), the government began promoting 
economic diversification. In 2012, the government tabled the development strategy 
Azerbaijan 2020: Look into the Future to foster non-hydrocarbon-based economic growth. 
In 2016, strategic road maps on the national economy and 11 individual sectors were 
adopted in response to the steep decline in global oil prices. They include economic 
development strategies and action plans for 2016-2020, a long-term outlook to 2025 and 
a vision beyond 2025. They also target annual average GDP growth of 3% to 2025. 
The 2016 Strategic Roadmap for the Development of Utilities (electricity, heat, water and 
gas) sets several specific strategic targets, such as sustainable and efficient utility sector 
regulation, the production of fully diversified and environmentally clean electrical power, 
the establishment of efficient and effective gas distribution infrastructure, the installation of 
sustainable and reliable heating supply systems, and lower water supply losses. It also 
calls for gradual transition to a liberal market model based on enhanced competition, 
unbundling, establishment of a wholesale market and a higher share of renewable energy. 
The roadmap was updated in July 2018.
Although many laws have been drafted in the past couple of years, they have yet to be 
adopted. In May 2019, a presidential order approved the document “Acceleration of 
Reforms in the Energy Sector of the Republic of Azerbaijan”. It proposes various reforms, 
such as the promotion of renewable energy and private sector investment in renewables, 
the preparation of a long-term energy sector development strategy, higher gas and heat 
system efficiency, and gradual opening of the electricity market to competition.

on the gas supply (revision of the 1998 law)
 on the energy sector (revision of the 1998 law).
A draft Law on Electricity, modelled on EU laws, targets gradual market reform by 2025. 
The government plans to permit independent generators to enter the sector and acquire 
existing power plants or build new ones (see Chapter 4).
Furthermore, a draft Law on the Efficient Use of Energy Resources and Energy Efficiency 
has been prepared with the assistance of Energy Charter experts. A National Action Plan 
on Energy Efficiency has also been prepared under the EU4Energy Programme (ECS, 
2020).
For technical assistance with energy sector reform, the government has been working in 
partnership with donors, international organisations and consultants, including the Asian 
Development Bank (ADB), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
(EBRD), the European Union (EU), the United States Agency for International 
Development (USAID) and the World Bank. 
Tariffs and subsidies 
The domestic energy sector’s financial viability is a major issue. Investments are needed 
to modernise and expand electricity, heat and gas infrastructure, but incentives have been 
weakened by a lack of competition and low end-user tariffs. 
Under the country’s social policy, end-user prices for electricity, natural gas and oil are 
very low. The tariff system includes cross-subsidies between consumer groups and energy 
carriers as well as direct subsidies from the state budget. Natural gas pricing particularly
creates distortions. For example, it discourages the use of renewable energy for electricity
production, heat pump adoption, and the installation of system solutions including the 
combined generation of district heating, cooling and electricity – all of which offer potential 
efficiency gains and CO2 emissions reductions. Meanwhile, low oil prices favour large, 
inefficient cars that are often acquired second-hand.
Low end-user prices imply considerable subsidies (Table 2.1). The IEA user price-gap 
methodology can be employed to estimate subsidies for fossil fuels consumed directly by 
end users or as inputs for electricity generation. In Azerbaijan’s case, natural gas and oil 
subsidies make up the difference between export prices and end-user prices, i.e. the 
opportunity cost of pricing domestic energy below international market levels. For 
electricity, the subsidy is the difference between the reference price and the end-user 
price. 
Since 2015, implied subsidies for oil, gas and fossil-fuelled electricity have all increased 
significantly, reflecting higher oil and gas export prices. In 2019, Azerbaijan’s implied 
subsidies amounted to USD 1.9 billion, or 4% of the country’s GDP. The average 
subsidisation rate was 43%, for a total of USD 190 per inhabitant.

Moreover, network tariffs for gas and electricity are based on a “cost-plus” methodology 
that does not encourage utilities to make their services more cost-efficient. On the contrary, 
this calculation method provides a perverse incentive for utilities to raise their operational 
costs to justify additional regulated revenue.
The financial burden of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the energy sector is increased 
by significant labour surpluses. Removing these structural constraints would require 
targeted and fiscally more efficient, explicit subsidy mechanisms (ADB, 2020).
Role separation could benefit both the government and SOEs. The World Bank proposes 
clear distinctions among the state’s roles as owner, policy maker and regulator. The aim 
should be for the state to separate decision-making from ownership responsibilities and
act as an engaged and professional owner of its assets, while granting the SOEs 
operational independence (World Bank, 2017). 
In addition, better corporate governance could significantly raise SOE competitiveness and 
profitability. OECD Guidelines on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises
offers helpful international benchmarks. 
Energy statistics
Detailed, complete, timely and reliable statistics are essential to support energy and 
climate decision-making in any country. In Azerbaijan, the SSC is responsible for 
collecting, validating and disseminating official energy statistics. Statistical data are open 
and in the public domain. The SSC also meets regularly with the MoE to discuss and share 
findings from the latest annual energy data. Other relevant entities are invited to participate 
in this event, making it a platform for dialogue and information-sharing among national 
data providers and users.
Since 2007, Azerbaijan’s official energy balance has been presented in accordance with 
international standards and methodology; the SSC actively participated in the working 
group developing the guidelines. Energy data are also shared with relevant international 
organisations: annual statistics with the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) and the 
IEA, and monthly oil and gas data with the Joint Organizations Data Initiative (JODI).
The first household energy consumption survey was carried out in 2008 and was repeated 
in greater detail in 2017 to enable the development of energy efficiency indicators for the 
residential sector. Thanks to these surveys, data on solid biomass consumption are
considered very reliable.
The SSC took on the task of compiling energy efficiency indicators in 2018, and having a 
national energy balance aligned with international standards greatly facilitates its work.

disaggregated transport activity data, which will greatly help develop energy efficiency data 
in that sector.
According to a presidential decree approved in 2018, an “integrated information system of 
public utility services” (IISPUS) is to be created, with the MoE as operator. The system will 
encompass metadata for public utility services (including natural gas, electricity and district 
heating) as well as an open data management system accessible to all stakeholders 
(energy providers, consumers and the regulator).
Assessment 
Since the IEA in-depth review of 2015, Azerbaijan has remained a source of stable and 
uninterrupted oil and gas supplies for diversified export markets. A major achievement has 
been completion of the Southern Gas Corridor and the launch of gas supply flows from the 
Shah Deniz 2 field to several European countries. Azerbaijan’s government and stateowned SOCAR were instrumental in realising this internationally significant project. 
In the domestic energy sector, the government has taken important steps to develop its 
legal and regulatory climate, diversify its energy mix, and strengthen its energy security: 
 A Strategic Road Map for the Development of Public Utility Services (Electricity, District 
Heat, Water and Natural Gas) in the Republic of Azerbaijan was approved by the president 
in 2016 and updated in July 2018. It set several strategic targets, including for sustainability 
and efficiency. 
 A new electricity law was drafted in concordance with a presidential decree in 2017 and 
aligned with the UE Third Energy Package. 
 The Energy Regulatory Agency was established in 2017. 
 The document “Acceleration of Reforms in the Energy Sector of the Republic of Azerbaijan” 
was approved by presidential order in 2019. It deals with reforms involving the promotion 
of renewable energy, efforts to increase energy efficiency, preparation of a long-term 
energy sector development strategy, and proposals for a planned transition to marketbased competition in the power sector. 
 This 2019 order resulted in the preparation of draft laws on a regulator for the energy sector 
and utilities services; on boosting the use of renewables for electricity production; on 
promoting energy efficiency; and on gas supply.
In addition, the government has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, and its NDC is 
to reduce GHG emissions 35% from the 1990 level by 2030. To this end, it has outlined 
climate change mitigation actions in a number of sectors including energy, and the Ministry 
of Ecology and Natural Resources is preparing both a national strategy for climate change 
and a national low-carbon strategy.
The government has also taken steps to meet growing electricity demand and strengthen 
energy security by commissioning new power plants. Around 2 gigawatts (GW) of capacity 
have been commissioned in the past ten years, with much of it coming online recently. 
 All rights reserved.Current focus is primarily on what needs to be achieved by 2030. Important as this is, it 
also arguable that an integrated long-term strategy is needed – one that builds on the
various strategy documents and plans currently under consideration, provides longer-term 
plans through 2040 or 2050, and brings together all the various strands of work on energy 
and climate change. Such a plan would be strengthened by private sector and other 
external stakeholder consultations; by instituting carefully planned governance 
arrangements based on close cross-government co-ordination; and by including clear 
targets and indicating how they are to be delivered.
There is also scope to build on progress already made and undertake structural reforms 
to develop competitive markets. This might best be done on a phased basis, bearing in 
mind the difficulties of moving from subsidised to market prices, and accompanied by 
measures to provide appropriate support for the most economically vulnerable citizens. 
Competitive markets would help attract private sector investment and send price signals 
reflecting future cost changes. Targeted subsidies could still be provided to not only protect 
society’s most vulnerable, but to support carefully directed government objectives such as 
the promotion of new renewables and energy efficiency (market prices alone would 
encourage this transition in the first place). One priority should be to ensure transparent 
and non-discriminatory access to the grid, as this is a prerequisite for a competitive power 
market and for attracting overseas investment in new generation capacity.
These changes will inevitably generate demand for new skills and capabilities in a variety 
of fields, for example in emissions measurement; energy and climate modelling; 
renewables, co-generation and trigeneration; and heating and cooling. Developing these 
skills in consultation with the private sector as well as schools, universities and research 
organisations – backed by the necessary financial resources, of course – should help 
minimise the risk that future capability gaps would impede progress, and should also 
create new skilled jobs.
Improving energy data use
Reliable data is the basis for sound policymaking. Since the 2015 IEA review, the SSC has 
improved energy efficiency data collection and monitoring and has also expanded public 
access to user-friendly energy information. The SSC is to be congratulated on the steps it 
has taken.
Given additional resources, it should be possible to raise the coverage of energy efficiency 
data for the main sectors of the economy (residential, transport and industry) as well as 
increase the level of data disaggregation. To support priority energy efficiency policies,
stakeholders (the SSC and the MoE) should clearly define responsibilities, compile a list 
of missing key indicators and formulate an action plan to fill the data gaps. This exercise 
should also clarify who will estimate data between surveys, and how to maximise synergies 
with existing data collection mechanisms to avoid increasing respondent burden. Once the 
IISPUS project is finalised, its energy consumption data could inform these estimates.
After the Law on the Efficient Use of Energy Resources and Energy Efficiency has been
adopted, it is expected that secondary legislation will define obligations and responsibilities 
 All rights reserved.ENERGY INS
Natural Resources, which uses it to formulate the energy module of the national GHG 
inventory. Leading academic programmes dealing with long-term energy modelling should 
also be considered important stakeholders and users of national energy data. Data 
available in electronic formats facilitates information-sharing among authorities, as does
close communication among energy data users. Having the main stakeholders actively
involved in the biannual consultative meetings would spur further development and use of 
energy statistics in the country, supporting the government’s objectives in the areas of 
energy efficiency, long-term energy modelling and GHG emissions reductions.
Recommendations
The government of Azerbaijan should:
 Build on existing policy work and plans with a view to developing an integrated longterm strategic plan for energy and climate change, ensuring effective co-ordination 
among all relevant government ministries and agencies as well as consultation with 
the private sector, higher education bodies and other stakeholders.
 Take the necessary action to rapidly finalise the draft laws and plans currently under 
consideration, including those for energy efficiency and renewables co-generation and 
trigeneration, and ensure their effective implementation based on clearly defined
responsibilities and accountabilities, with adequate resources.
 Take steps to assess and build the capabilities and skills needed in the future, 
including through education and training, and improve public awareness of the reasons 
for energy policy changes and their benefits.
 Further develop the national energy statistics system to improve data coverage and 
quality and to inform policy decisions by:
> Ensuring (with the help of the SSC) that appropriate data are available for 
energy planning and for energy efficiency indicator development (for the 
residential, transport and industry sectors).
> Defining appropriate progress-monitoring mechanisms in secondary energy 
efficiency legislation through dialogue between the MoE and the SSC, while also
clarifying related responsibilities.
> Developing the biannual stakeholder meeting between the MoE and the SSC so 
that it provides a flexible platform for dialogue among all the main data providers 
and users, including academia.
> Completing the IISPUS project and adopting it as the main instrument of
electronic data governance for public utility services.

Overview
Azerbaijan depends on crude oil for most of its export and government revenue. 
Developments in global oil demand and prices are therefore critical for the country. Oil 
production began in the mid-19th century but has been in decline since 2010. Natural gas 
is also important to Azerbaijan’s economy. In contrast to oil, natural gas production, which 
became significant in the 2000s, continues to increase. Efforts to modernise and increase 
oil refining and petrochemicals production have been successful and are continuing.
Oil and gas resources are plentiful, but the long-term outlook for exports – and therefore 
for government revenue – is uncertain, as major importing countries have recently 
committed to net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. 
Domestically, oil and gas continue to provide almost all primary energy, including around 
90% of electricity generation. The state-owned State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan

History of Azerbaijan’s oil and gas production
Azerbaijan is one of the first places in the world to have produced oil regularly. The history 
of its oil and gas sector can be split into five distinct phases: early history (to 1870), first oil 
boom (1871-1921), onshore boom in the Soviet era (1921-48), offshore boom in the Soviet 
era (1949-91), and the third oil boom (1991 onwards).
Active local production and trade of light and dark crude oil has been documented as early 
as the 10th century, initially around the Absheron Peninsula and later in Baku as well as 
Balakhany. In the 16th century, some 500 oil wells were dug by hand to depths of as much 
as 35 metres (m) in Baku alone. Azerbaijani oil was transported and sold in Europe, 
Turkey, the Northern Caucasus, Iran and Central Asia. 
The world’s first modern oil well was drilled in Absheron, Bibiheybat, in 1846, 13 years 
before the first US oil well in Pennsylvania. New well drilling technologies opened new 
fields and boosted oil production. As the number of operating companies multiplied, 
Azerbaijan introduced its first oil industry regulations and concession auctions in 1872. 
After almost a decade in Azerbaijan, Bank Rothschild founded the Caspian-Black Sea Oil 
Company in 1886 and controlled 42% of Baku’s oil exports by 1890. Azerbaijani production 
rose from 20 thousand barrels per day (kbd) (1 million tonnes/year [Mt/a]) in 1883 to 
200-220 kbd (10-11 Mt/a) in 1901-1904, accounting for over 50% of world production. 
Rising oil volumes required infrastructure. In 1859, the country built its first oil refinery1 and 
by 1867 some 15 oil refineries were operating. The first ever oil pipeline to connect the 
Baku refineries to the Balakhany oil fields (12 km) was commissioned in 1878, and by 
1898 some 230 km of pipes linked refineries to oil fields. The Baku-Batumi railway was 
commissioned in 1883 to export crude oil and oil products to Europe. The Baku-Batumi 
pipeline was completed in 1907.
Oil production subsequently fell to around 150 kbd (7.4 Mt/a in 1910-1917) under the 
pressures of war, revolution and other shocks. On the eve of the Soviet nationalisation of 
Azerbaijan’s oil industry in 1920, oil production had deteriorated to 60 kbd (2.9 Mt/a), and 
it fell further to 50 kbd in 1921 (2.5 Mt/a). At the time, the oil industry comprised some 270 
oil producing enterprises, 49 small and mid-sized drilling firms, 25 refining companies, and 
over 100 mechanical, repair and other businesses. 
The first of two peaks in drilling during the Soviet era delivered large onshore discoveries. 
Oil output rose steadily to 470 kbd (23.6 Mt) in 1941, accounting for 76% of Soviet oil 
production. Output then quickly slid to an average 240 kbd (12.0 Mt/a) in 1943-1946, as 
the USSR transferred Azerbaijan’s oil engineers to develop fields in Central Asia. 
The second Soviet-era drilling peak came in the early 1950s and opened up offshore 
exploitation, as some of the first techniques for offshore drilling and infrastructure were 
 
1 A combination of distillation and cooling plants for the extraction of kerosene.

reached 430 kbd (21.5 Mt/a).
Until 1970, offshore work depths did not exceed 40 m. Subsequent investment in offshore 
equipment extended depths to 70 m and eventually to 350 m in the late 1970s and early 
1980s at fields such as Chirag, Kapaz, and Gunashli (Gunashli currently produces more 
than 60% of SOCAR's oil). Production from new offshore fields slowed but did not stop the 
steady decline in aggregate Azerbaijani output that began after 1965-1966 and lasted until 
1995 (except for a brief recovery in 1985-1988). Overall, production stagnated and slowly 
declined to 410 kbd (20 Mt/a), or 5.7% of the Soviet Union’s output in 1970. Declines 
continued until the recession following Azerbaijani independence (post-1991), when oil 
production fell to 200 kbd (10 Mt/a) (Ciarreta and Nasirov, 2010). 
Following collapse of the USSR, Azerbaijan adopted a new oil and gas strategy aimed at
boosting the country’s economy. In September 1994, SOCAR and a BP-led consortium of 
international energy companies (organised as the Azerbaijan International Operating 
Company – AIOC)4 signed a 30-year (1994-2024) production sharing agreement (PSA) 
called the Contract of the Century to develop the supergiant Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) 
block. In September 2017, the PSA was extended to the end of 2049.5 In 1996, the 
government signed a further PSA for developing the Shah Deniz gas field with another 
BP-led consortium (including SOCAR and five other companies).6 The combined contracts 
revitalised the oil and gas sector, attracting massive international investments and 
increases in oil and gas revenues for the country. 
In 2006, construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline to transport oil from Baku 
to the Mediterranean substantially facilitated the access of Caspian Sea oil resources to 
the world oil market. More recently, the construction of natural gas pipelines through 
Turkey to the European Union has unlocked access to Caspian gas resources and yielded 
Azerbaijan associated export revenues while allowing associated gas condensate 
production to rise. 
Reserves 
Azerbaijan’s remaining commercial liquid reserves (crude and condensate) are typically 
indicated to be 7.0 billion barrels (bbl) (BP, 2020). However, the Wood Mackenzie 
consultancy suggests they may amount to only 4.11 billion bbl and explains that official 
data tend to be optimistic and often include some sub-commercial volumes (Wood

Azerbaijan’s oil and gas reserves are located mainly in the South Caspian basin, split 
between the Kura Intermontane depression and the South Caspian depression. The 
former includes most of the onshore fields and the shallow-water offshore fields. The latter 
contains the deeper water reservoirs, which have almost all of Azerbaijan's significant 
remaining resources with exploration and development potential (Wood Mackenzie, 2020). 
The shallow waters of the Absheron-Pribalkhan trough, off the Absheron Peninsula, 
contain most of Azerbaijan’s liquid reserves in a few large fields. There are also some 
onshore resources in the Gobustan trough, but these account for around only 3% of oil 
reserves. Azerbaijan's gas reserves exist both as non-associated offshore gas deposits 
and as associated gas at offshore oil fields (onshore reserves are insignificant). Most of 
the reserves are concentrated in the Absheron-Pribalkhan trough and the South Caspian 
deep-water sub-basin.

Onshore fields (including the onshore Absheron peninsula, one of the world’s oldest oil 
provinces) account for around only 3% of total Azerbaijani output today. They have 
suffered heavy depletion over many decades of development. Nevertheless, onshore 
reserves offer some limited upside potential through rehabilitation and deeper exploration.
Offshore fields now offer the greatest potential for the future. The shallow-water Absheron 
province is the main productive oil play, and its remaining prospective resources lie to the 
south of the peninsula. Multiple fields have been discovered there in the past 50 years, 
including the ACG (around 70% of both current oil production and remaining commercial 
oil reserves), Gunashli (around 10% of current oil production), oil at Gum Deniz, gas at 
Bahar, and large discoveries at Oil Rocks (Wood Mackenzie, 2020). Outside of the 
Absheron-Pribalkhan trend (where the ACG field is), offshore oil exploration has been
disappointing. Offshore commercial fields offer further prospects for the development of 
gas resources, notably at Shah Deniz Phase 3 and in the form of ACG non-associated 
gas. In the north and west of the Absheron peninsula, minor oil discoveries have been 
made, some of which yielded gas (including SOCAR’s Nakhichevan field).

Exploration and production 
Licensing: Production sharing agreements and risk service 
contracts 
Azerbaijan’s oil and gas resource development since 1991 has depended on licensing 
international oil companies (IOCs). Azerbaijan does not allocate exploration and 
development licences through routine competitive licensing rounds; instead, SOCAR has 
directly negotiated almost all contracts. It has arranged licences annually since 1991, 
except in 2003, 2006, 2013 and 2015. It conferred the first 25 licences in the 10 years from 
1991 to 2000, after which activity slowed and the next 25 licences were awarded from 
2001 to 2018. Following the first contract relinquishment in 1999, companies had 
relinquished 17 licences by 2018. Exploration remains active, with several exploration and 
appraisal wells planned (both on- and offshore). 
In Azerbaijan, upstream projects involving international partners operate almost 
exclusively under PSAs (also called production sharing contracts [PSCs]), but recently risk 
service contracts (RSCs) have also been awarded. Prior to the ground-breaking ACG PSA 
in 1994 (often referred to as the Contract of the Century), Azerbaijan used joint venture 
(JV) contracts, but none have been issued since 1998 and all previous JVs were converted 
to PSAs by 2010. Through SOCAR, the state holds a direct interest in all PSAs of 10-50%. 
The first RSC was awarded in 2017 (offshore Umid-Babek), with a second following in 
2018 (offshore Karabagh). Each individual PSA and RSC is ratified by the parliament and 
the president and has the status of a separate law.
PSAs and RSCs share common attributes: they both grant foreign oil companies exclusive 
rights to explore a defined area and to make discoveries; neither confers a right to title 
over the oil produced; both deduct production costs to determine net profit for sharing; and 
neither surrenders sovereignty over resources. The foreign partner assumes all risks and 
costs (carrying SOCAR through the initial investment phases) and, if it makes a 
commercial discovery, has those costs reimbursed plus a share of the production. A PSA 
remunerates companies in oil (cost oil and profit oil), while an RSC remunerates 
companies with cash for costs and profit oil.
PSA and RSC terms include signature bonuses paid to the state, commerciality bonuses 
in the event of a commercial discovery, production bonuses when a commercial discovery 
comes into production, fixed cost recovery (excluding bonuses), and profit splits based on 
a sliding-scale recovery factor.
7 No royalties are payable, and crude oil (for cost recovery 
and profit sharing) is valued at the netback value (weighted average price for quarterly 
export sales adjusted for transportation costs). Azerbaijan has respected the tax stability 
 
7 The R-factor defines the sliding scale that divides remaining production after cost recovery between the contractor 
and the government. R = cumulative net income / cumulative investment, where cumulative net income = cumulative 
capital cost recovery + cumulative financing cost recovery + cumulative contractor's profit share, and where cumulative 
investment = cumulative capital costs incurred
 All rights reserved.discovery.
Most Azerbaijani PSAs have an exploration phase that lasts three years and imposes a 
minimum work plan (environmental and site surveys, defined numbers of 3D seismic 
surveys, and a defined number of exploration wells). PSAs may have an optional two-year 
extension, contingent on drilling more wells. If exploration results in a commercial 
discovery, the government usually awards a 25-year development phase (plus a 
negotiable five-year extension). The development phase begins with the preparation of a 
work programme that has to be undertaken within three years of the date the commercial 
discovery is announced. 
Subject to SOCAR’s approval, PSA or RSC contractors may assign all or part of their 
interest to third parties. They can also give up their contract area to SOCAR, with 90 days’ 
notice and once all obligations have been fulfilled or against payment of an equivalent sum 
to SOCAR. Contract holders are not charged VAT but must pay a 10% withholding tax. 
Tax rates for foreign subcontractors vary and are defined separately for individual PSAs. 
Drilling
Onshore drilling has historically fallen to SOCAR. Between 1986 and 1996, SOCAR’s 
activity (both onshore and offshore as well as in maintenance) declined significantly 
because of insufficient funds. SOCAR failed to develop discoveries (such as ACG), expand 
production, or further its exploration programme. However, SOCAR’s financial resources 
recovered following Azerbaijani independence and the arrival of IOCs. It made its first 
major offshore deep-water discovery in 2010 (the Umid field). 
Offshore drilling in Azerbaijan involves significant complications, notably deep reservoirs 
(3 000-6 000 m, roughly twice the depth of onshore fields), high pressures (typically over 
8 500 psi, or 586 bar), and unconsolidated seabeds. IOCs drilled 18 offshore exploration 
wells between 1991 and 2018, of which only two resulted in commercial discoveries (the 
Shah Deniz and the Absheron gas condensate fields).
Furthermore, the services sector for the oil and gas industry has continually constrained
exploration and development, and it has taken almost three decades to build up offshore 
drilling facilities. Insufficient deep-water facilities and a concentration of service providers 
in just a few companies have imposed long lead times before first production, particularly 
for deepwater projects. 
Semi-submersible rigs are essential both for deepwater exploration and appraisal activity 
and for developing complex projects (such as Shah Deniz and Absheron). To manage the 
post-independence scarcity of drilling facilities, early offshore operators (four companies) 
formed the first “Rig Club” to share two rigs (Dada Gorgud and Istiglal). This was not 
enough to prevent persistent rig shortages, however, so SOCAR pressured international 
operators for assistance, resulting in initial upgrades (Istiglal in 1999, at a cost of
USD 210 million, and Dada Gorgud in 2000, worth USD 36 million) followed by further 
modernisation. Dada Gorgud is now capable of drilling to 7 620 m in water depths of up to 
475 m, and Istiglal (which was further upgraded in 2015-2016) can drill to 7 620 m in water 
 All rights reserved.ENERGY SEC
completed the Heydar Aliyev (at a cost of more than USD 1 billion), a semi-submersible 
sixth-generation rig capable of withstanding up to 1 400 atmospheres of pressure at water 
depths of up to 1 000 m. While the rig spudded its first well in 2018 for Total's Absheron 
EPS, it will facilitate deepwater activity in general and help free up other drilling resources. 
Azerbaijan’s operators also occasionally arrange to use a small fleet of jack-up rigs 
operating elsewhere in the Caspian. 
Oil production
Azerbaijan’s oil production peaked at just over 1 million barrels per day (mbd) in 2009-
2010 (of which around 40 kbd was gas condensate) and then gradually declined to 780 kbd 
in 2019 (of which 60 kbd is condensate and 17 kbd is natural gas liquids [NGLs]) (Figure 
3.1). Development of the ACG field has sustained output growth since 1997, and it 
continues to supply most of Azerbaijan’s oil. In 2010, ACG production amounted to 
828 kbd, or around 80% of the country’s total oil supply, but by 2019 it had fallen to 
540 kbd, representing around 70% of the total (IEA, 2020a). ACG’s peak thus fell well 
below the 1.2 mbd expected by BP in 2006 (BP, 2006). 
Azerbaijan has agreed to several voluntary output cuts in recent years. In December 2016, 
it joined other non-OPEC producers to co-operate with OPEC in efforts to stabilise the oil 
market (later formalised in a Charter of Cooperation or Declaration of Cooperation, signed 
on 2 July 2019). On that occasion, Azerbaijan agreed to cut output by 20 kbd for six months 
(from a baseline value of 796 kbd in October 2016) as part of broader non-OPEC cuts of 
558 kbd and OPEC cuts of 1.2 mbd starting 1 January 2017. 
Since then, OPEC and non-OPEC countries have regularly extended their Declaration of 
Cooperation at biannual OPEC/non-OPEC meetings. In 2020, as part of the OPEC+ 
response to the Covid-19 impact on oil demand, Azerbaijan agreed to cut production from 
720 kbd in October 2019 to an average of 580 kbd from June to December 2020. In 2021, 
OPEC+ has reduced the production cuts, enabling Azerbaijan to gradually increase its 
production to 620 kbd in July. Future oil production will depend upon managing the decline 
of the ACG field, the development of condensate and NGL production from offshore gas 
discoveries, and future exploration success.
To manage falling ACG production, BP (the operator) is investing in short-cycle brownfield opportunities at ACG. The company is also investing in a new production platform 
(Azeri Central East [ACE]) to ramp up production to a peak of 100 kbd in the mid-2020s, 
briefly stabilising overall ACG output. The new investment follows extension of the PSA in 
2017 to end-2049. 
The development of offshore condensate production in recent years has slowed the 
decline in Azerbaijani oil output, reflecting the preponderance of gas discoveries in new 
developments (e.g. Absheron, Shafag Asiman and Babek). Despite additional condensate 
from offshore gas projects (notably Shah Deniz 2 and Absheron Deep Water), overall 
liquids production will continue to fall as output from ACG declines.

Companies have also shown renewed interest in onshore and near-shore exploration. 
Although smaller than the deepwater fields, onshore prospects tend towards higher-value 
liquids; projects do not depend upon semi-submersible offshore rigs with limited 
availability; and any discoveries can be more readily fast-tracked for development (Wood 
Mackenzie, 2020). BP signed a PSA with SOCAR in December 2014 to jointly explore and 
develop potential prospects in the shallow-water area around the Absheron Peninsula up 
to the margins of the Caspian basin in water depths of up to 40 m and potential reservoir 
depths of 3 000-5 000 m. This PSA gives BP a 50% interest as operator. BP has since 
committed to drill exploration wells in three prospective areas. 
Gas production
Azerbaijan has three main sources of gas: 1) the Shah Deniz field, the country’s largest 
gas resource (around 19 bcm output in 2020); 2) associated gas from the ACG block, 
which is provided free to SOCAR under the PSA; and 3) volumes produced by SOCAR 
from the Shallow-Water Gunashli field and other smaller fields. 
Shah Deniz phase 1 started production in 2006 and quickly made Azerbaijan an important 
producer of gas as well as oil. It allowed the country to halt gas imports from Russia and 
rapidly become a regional gas exporter. Initially, Shah Deniz 1 could produce around 
10 bcm/a of natural gas and around 50 kbd of condensates. In 2014, action was taken to 
remove bottlenecks, increasing production capacity to 10.8 bcm/a. The construction of 
Shah Deniz 2 started in 2014 and the first gas was delivered in July 2018. Shah Deniz 2 
is ramping up to produce 16 bcm/a in the early 2020s (Figure 3.2). 
Shah Deniz 2 is the gas source for the Southern Gas Corridor (SGC) project, which will 
take Caspian gas across Georgia and Turkey to Europe. The 16 bcm/a maximum 
production has been sold under long-term contracts to Turkey (6 bcm) and Greece, 
Bulgaria and Italy (10 bcm). SOCAR announced in 2018 that a phase 3 was being 
considered for Shah Deniz, but it is not yet clear whether this will go ahead (Caspian News, 
2018; Wood Mackenzie, 2020).

Two other recent discoveries appear set to boost longer-term Azerbaijani gas production: 
Umid and Absheron (deepwater). Umid, commissioned in 2012, currently produces 
modest volumes, and SOCAR has so far not succeeded in attracting IOC partners for its 
expansion. Absheron, fast-tracked via a small-scale early-production scheme (as a single 
subsea well), is expected to begin production in 2022 and reach 1.4 bcm in 2023 (reserves 
are estimated at 350 bcm of gas and 350 mb of condensate). Subsequently, a larger-scale 
Phase 1 project will expand output.
Box 3.1 The status of national borders in the Caspian Sea
The legal status of national borders in the Caspian Sea has a direct impact on offshore oil 
and gas development as well as on the development of trans-border infrastructure, notably 
oil and gas pipelines crossing the Caspian.
The five Caspian states (Azerbaijan, Islamic Republic of Iran (hereafter ‘Iran’), Kazakhstan, 
Russia and Turkmenistan) signed the landmark Convention on the Legal Status of the 
Caspian Sea in August 2018, almost 30 years after the breakup of the Soviet Union. The 
Convention establishes a special legal regime for the Caspian Sea, distinguishing between 
the legal treatment of its surface and seabed (subsoil). It also provides a framework for 
future bilateral or trilateral talks, as well as environmental protection measures, and allows 
construction of subsea pipelines under agreements only between affected countries (Article 
14), obviating the need for approval by all Caspian states. The Convention should allow the 
resolution of various territorial claims by the Caspian states, as most states have ratified it 
(Turkmenistan in December 2018, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan in February 2019, and 
Russia in October 2019). Only Iran has not ratified the Convention.
Independently of the Convention, Russia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan agreed on 
demarcations of their respective maritime borders in the north Caspian Sea (based on the 
median line principle) through individual agreements between 1998 and 2003, and they 
signed a trilateral accord in 2003-2004. The agreement specifically includes development

 All rights reserved.South Caspian Sea border delimitation remains in dispute, but a framework for future 
bilateral talks exists, since Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan have both agreed to the median 
line principle, although their maritime border remains undefined. The AzerbaijanTurkmenistan maritime border has a potentially greater impact on the oil and gas industry. 
The signing of a memorandum of understanding between Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan in 
January 2021 on joint exploration and development of the Dostluk (Friendship) field 
(formerly Serdar/Kapaz) is a positive development. It also paves the way to potentially 
developing the Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline to deliver Turkmen gas to Azerbaijan and 
Europe.
Both Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan have border disputes with Iran, which refuses to support 
the median line principle and does not recognise the Russian-Kazakh-Azerbaijani trilateral 
accord.
Further exploration and development of deepwater offshore prospects will support the 
expansion of gas production. Prospects include further development of discovered 
resources of non-associated (deep) gas at ACG, Babek (SOCAR-operated) and Shafag 
Asiman (BP-operated) (Wood Mackenzie, 2020). As with oil, lead times from discovery to 
first gas production could be long due to deepwater service facility constraints. Major gas 
export expansion would also require new gas processing facilities and pipeline extension. 
The ramp-up in Shah Deniz 2 and Absheron production looks set to lift Azerbaijani gas 
production in 2019 by around 4 bcm/a to an initial peak of around 28 bcm/a in 2022-2023. 
After a slight dip in subsequent years, new development (Babek, Umid, and Absheron 
Phases 1 and 2) could push output from 2022-2023 up by 10% to a new peak in 2030 
(Rystad Energy, 2020). Development of Shah Deniz 3 would further augment output.
Trade
Crude oil trade
Azerbaijan exports only one single crude quality, the relatively light sweet grade Azeri Light 
(35.2° API and 0.14% S). In 2019, Azerbaijan reported total exports of 31.2 Mt of crude 
and condensates. Exports peaked at around 44 Mt in 2009-2010 and have declined 
steadily since then, following Azerbaijan’s falling crude production (Figure 3.3). The 
decline accelerated slightly in 2019 after the country adhered to the OPEC/Non-OPEC 
Declaration of Cooperation that obliged it to cut output, and exports fell further in 2020 as 
these cuts were expanded.
 All rights reserved.ENERGY SEC
Azerbaijan’s export destinations are diversified, but most are in Europe and the 
Mediterranean region. 
Note: 2019 data are provisional.
Source: IEA (2021a), World Energy Balances 2021 (database), www.iea.org/statistics. 
Over 80% of Azerbaijan’s crude exports were delivered to destinations in Europe in 
2019, with Italy receiving 39%, Germany 11% and the Czech Republic 8%. Around 19% 
of crude exports went to non-European destinations, with China accounting for slightly 
over 5% and Canada for around 1%. Other export destinations close to Europe include 
Tunisia and Israel, and other destinations in Asia include major refiners such as India, 
Indonesia, Taiwan and Thailand. Most of these exports are loaded at the Ceyhan 
terminal in Turkey. Minor volumes move to European destinations through the Russian 
pipeline system (around 0.8 Mt in 2019, mostly delivered to Austria) or are loaded from 
ports in Georgia (see Figure 3.6 map). 
Oil product trade
Oil product trade amounted to 1.5 Mt in 2019. Azerbaijan’s net product surplus has 
progressively eroded over the past decade (Figure 3.4 and Figure 3.5). With rapid growth 
in car use, gasoline demand has outstripped refinery production since 2014 and moved 
the country from being a net gasoline exporter to a modest net importer (around 
280 kilotonnes [kt] in 2019). In addition to premium gasoline, which is not produced in 
the country, net imports include some heavy fuel oil. For other major oil products, 
Azerbaijan is balanced or is a net exporter.

Refining policy has focused on meeting domestic gasoline demand, and the resulting 
surplus products, mainly gasoil and kerosene, create export opportunities. More generally, 
SOCAR imports products to cover local needs during peak seasonal demand, periods of 
refinery maintenance or refinery outages.
Oil export infrastructure 
Although much of Azerbaijan's oil and gas infrastructure dates from the Soviet era, its 
export infrastructure was diversified after independence in the 1990s and 2000s in 
response to large new upstream projects. Foreign investment has been critical for building 
the new export routes and maintaining the legacy pipeline network, which remains in need 
of intensive repairs. 
Oil is exported through three pipelines and by rail. Crude oil is mostly delivered by the BTC
pipeline to Ceyhan, Turkey, and by the Western Route Export Pipeline (WREP) to Supsa,

in Turkey. It has a capacity of 1.2 mbd. The BTC was inaugurated in May 2005 and its first 
oil reached Ceyhan in May 2006. While it mainly transports oil from ACG and condensate 
from Shah Deniz, it also carries oil from Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. BP operates the 
Azerbaijani and Georgian sections of the pipeline, and BOTAS International Limited the 
Turkish section.
The 833-km WREP (Baku-Supsa pipeline) has a capacity of 150 kbd. It was completed in 
1999, following an intergovernmental agreement with Georgia signed in 1996. The WREP 
is owned by the AIOC and operated by BP.
The 1 330-km NREP has been operating since 1983, and originally transported crude oil 
from Grozny (Russia) to Baku for processing. In 1997, the pipeline was reversed and 
upgraded to pump crude from the Sangachal terminal to the port of Novorossiysk in the 
Black Sea basin. The pipeline was then used to export ACG crude until 2007 when this oil 
shifted to the BTC pipeline. SOCAR continues to use the 105-kbd NREP to diversify export 
outlets, but volumes averaged around only 25 kbd in 2014-2018 (Wood Mackenzie, 2020). 
The pipeline is operated collaboratively by Russia’s oil pipeline operator, Transneft, and 
SOCAR.
Cross-border rail infrastructure can transport around 280 kbd of crude oil, condensate and 
refined products to Georgia's Black Sea ports of Batumi, Kulevi and Poti, and to Kars in 
Turkey. Usage has fallen well below capacity, however, as competitive pipeline options 
are preferred. The Baku-Tbilisi-Batumi/Poti rail line (built in 1883, repaired and restored in 
1999) is used by SOCAR and by ACG producers not belonging to the BTC Pipeline 
consortium; it is also used for gas condensate from Shah Deniz. The Baku-Kulevi line was 
commissioned in 2008.
Kazakh crude and Turkmen oil products are transported on both lines to the Georgian 
ports. Azerbaijan's Caspian ports and terminals regularly trans-ship Central Asian crude 
and refined products to the Black Sea (via pipeline or rail, mainly from SOCAR’s 10 Mt/a 
Dubendi Oil Terminal, which is 50 km northeast of Baku) and to the Mediterranean (crude 
via the BTC pipeline). Despite requiring multiple transfers between tankers, pipelines and 
rail, the routes are competitive with exports via Russia because, unlike in the Transneft 
system, they segregate the crude, preserving its quality-linked value.
Box 3.2 The Sangachal oil and gas terminal 
Sangachal is one of the world's largest oil and gas terminals, and it is the critical hub of 
Azerbaijan’s oil and gas sector. It receives, processes, stores and exports crude oil and gas 
from all BP-operated assets in the Caspian basin, particularly from ACG and Shah Deniz. It 
also receives third-party oil from Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. The terminal is located in 
a 600-hectare area on the Caspian Sea coast 55 km south of Baku. It is owned by the 
Azerbaijani International Operating Company and operated by BP.
 All rights reserved.pocess, soe ad epo0 bd ocude a ppee o Supsa ad ooossysS
significantly expanded the terminal’s capacity to receive, process and store oil from the Azeri 
and Deepwater Gunashli sections of the ACG field, and to receive and process gas from 
the Shah Deniz field. It houses three crude oil storage tanks of 880 kb each, together with 
the ACG oil processing facilities. It also accommodates the head pump station of the BTC 
oil pipeline and the compressor of the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum gas pipeline (also known as the 
South Caucasus Pipeline [SCP]). In 2018, the terminal was further expanded to 
accommodate gas from Shah Deniz. 
The terminal can process 1.2 mbd of crude and store around 3.2 mb (4.0 mb maximum). It 
can also process around 50 million cubic metres per day (mcm/d) (18.2 bcm/a) of gas 
(30 mcm/d from Shah Deniz and 20 mcm/d from ACG).
During the first three months of 2020, the Sangachal terminal exported about 735 kbd of 
crude and condensate (640 kbd via the BTC and around 95 kbd through the WREP). BP 
indicates that processed gas during this period amounted to 51 mcm/d. Most of it was 
exported via the SCP and SCP expansion system, but some of it was fed into the national 
gas grid.

Gas trade 
The Azerbaijani gas market and gas trade remained modest until 2007, when Shah 
Deniz 1 was commissioned. Since then, gas supply has expanded rapidly. Azerbaijan has 
developed its own natural gas use, with around 96% of the population today having access 
to gas, and has put pipeline infrastructure in place for gas exports. 
After the commissioning of Shah Deniz 1, the Azerbaijani gas market developed rapidly, 
and Azerbaijan transitioned from being a net gas importer (from Russia) to a regional 
exporter, with exports going to Georgia and Turkey (via the SCP) as well as to Russia 
(2010-2014). Sharply rising domestic demand and a surge in exports (from 1.8 bcm in 
2007 to 6.8 bcm in 2011 and 8.1 bcm in 2015) tightened the Azerbaijani gas balance in 
2016 and 2017, forcing the country to import gas from Russia and Turkmenistan (via Iran) 
to meet domestic demand as well as its rising export obligations to Georgia and Turkey.
The launch of Shah Deniz 2 in 2018 enabled Azerbaijan to reduce gas imports and expand 
exports. The seasonality of Azerbaijani gas demand is likely to continue to create periodic 
domestic supply shortfalls, sustaining some import volumes. Imports from Turkmenistan 
fell from 1.8 bcm in 2017 to 0.6 bcm in 2019, while those from Russia increased from 
0.3 bcm in 2017 to around 1 bcm in 2018 and dropped again to 0.7 bcm in 2019.
Exports reached 11.8 bcm in 2019, notably to Turkey through the newly launched TransAnatolian Pipeline (TANAP). Azerbaijan also exports gas to Georgia (2 bcm in 2018, 
 All rights reserved.ENERGY SEC
since 2004, in which Baku supplies gas to Iran’s isolated northwest border city of Astara 
(disconnected from Iran’s gas grid) and Iran transits 85% of it to Nakhichevan while 
retaining 15% as payment-in-kind for its role. In 2020, Turkey and Azerbaijan fast-tracked 
a new pipeline to Nakhichevan through eastern Turkey (planned since 2010) with a 
capacity of around 2 bcm/a (over four times the region's consumption). The pipeline will 
not begin operating until 2022 at the earliest (Eurasianet, 2020).
Gas export infrastructure
The SGC dominates Azerbaijan’s gas export infrastructure. The project was planned to 
transport Caspian gas to Europe, initially from Shah Deniz 2, and potentially later from the 
broader Caspian region. Azerbaijan signed an initial Joint Declaration on the SGC with the 
European Union in January 2011 and committed to the long-term supply of about 10 bcm/a 
of gas (ECS, 2011). 
The 3 600-km SGC pipeline system comprises four parts: the Shah Deniz 2 gas field; the 
SCP expansion from the Sangachal terminal to Georgia; the TANAP from Turkey’s border 
with Georgia to its border with Greece; and the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) from 
Greece’s border with Turkey across Albania and under the Adriatic Sea to Puglia in Italy. 
SOCAR and BP are key shareholders in each of the four parts of the SGC, but several 
other national and international energy companies also hold shares in them. The SGC, 
which was a priority energy project for the European Union, has now been successfully 
completed. The 16-bcm/a TANAP was commissioned in 2018 and the 10-bcm/a TAP in 
November 2020, and their capacity can be doubled with additional investments. Gas 
deliveries to Italy began at the end of December 2020.
In late 2011, the European Union began negotiations with Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan 
on developing a Trans-Caspian pipeline to transport Turkmen gas to Europe through 
Azerbaijan and Turkey. Despite negotiations reportedly ongoing, other neighbouring 
countries have yet to support the project (see Box 3.1). No natural gas is currently transited
through the territory of Azerbaijan.
 All rights reserved.IEA 2020. All rights reserved.
Azerbaijan also exports gas to Georgia, for which it is the main gas supplier. SOCAR 
exports the gas via a legacy Kazi Magomed-Kazakh pipeline, which was commissioned in 
1970 and extended to Tbilisi in 1972. The 5-bcm/a pipeline was originally used to deliver 
Russian and Turkmen gas to Azerbaijan and also to Georgia and Armenia. In 2010, the 
pipeline was reversed to export Azerbaijani gas under a five-year gas sales agreement 
that was cut short at the end of 2014 (IEA, 2020b).
Azerbaijan’s pipeline system has been connected with Iran’s through the Kazi MagomedAstara line since 1971. The line was used as part of a swap to deliver Iranian gas to the 
Soviet Union, which exported an equivalent amount to Europe. The capacity was 
11.4 bcm/a. Azerbaijan reversed the line in 2006 to allow exports to Iran (1-2 bcm/a) to 
supply the Nakhichevan exclave through swaps.

Republic of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ) alone has provided around half of the governments
revenue in the past decade. From 2010 to 2019, its share ranged from 36.9% in 2017 to 
58.2% in 2013 and the median was 49.7% (SOFAZ, 2019). The oil and gas sector share 
in 2019 totalled 59%: in addition to SOFAZ transfers, it included taxes paid by SOCAR and 
the foreign contractors of the ACG and Shah Deniz PSAs. 
The government established SOFAZ in 1999 as a sovereign wealth fund for oil industry 
revenues. The main objective of SOFAZ is to accumulate and efficiently manage oil and 
gas revenues by transforming depletable hydrocarbon reserves into assets in non-oil 
sectors, both domestically and internationally, which, in turn, generate perpetual income 
for both current and future generations. According to its rules, SOFAZ is to save and invest 
25% of the peak oil and gas revenues it receives. To date, most of its revenues have been 
used to fund the government budget, but total assets grew from USD 22 billion to USD 
43 billion between 2010 and 2019, and they generated an average annual rate of return of 
1.8%. As of January 2021, SOFAZ held assets of USD 43.6 billion, almost equalling the 
country’s GDP. 
In 2019, SOFAZ’s revenues totalled AZN 19.0 billion (USD 11.2 billion) and expenditures 
AZN 11.6 billion (USD 6.8 billion). The revenues were mostly from the sales of oil from 
ACG (USD 7.9 billion) and gas and condensates from Shah Deniz (USD 0.6 billion). The 
state share of the ACG profit oil is fixed at 75%, while its share of Shah Deniz gas is based 
on a sliding-scale recovery factor defined in the PSA. Revenues also included returns from 
SOFAZ’s investments (USD 2.1 billion), bonus payments (USD 0.45 billion) and other oil 
and gas sales revenue, transit fees and acreage fees (USD 0.069 billion in total). Transfers 
to the government budget accounted for 98% of SOFAZ’s expenditures, while the rest was 
used for social projects and SOFAZ’s administrative expenses (SOFAZ, 2019). 
The share of oil and gas in Azerbaijan’s export revenues is relatively stable, ranging from 
90% to 94% during 2014-2019. Growing volumes of gas exports increased its share of 
export revenues from 7% in 2014 to 13% in 2019, while declining volumes and unit prices 
of crude oil reduced its share from 83% in 2014 to 74% in 2019 (Table 3.2).

Demand
Oil demand
In 2019, oil consumption in Azerbaijan was 4.9 Mt (Figure 3.7). Excluding power and heat 
generation, it rose by just over 47% between 2008 and 2019. Most of the growth came from 
the transport sector, where oil consumption increased 51% over the period. The government 
does not publish energy scenarios, but it is reasonable to assume that oil demand in 
transport will continue to rise as car ownership increases.
The transport sector (mostly road transport) remains by far the largest oil-consuming sector, 
using 62% of the total in 2019. Road transport consumption is split roughly 60/40 between 
motor gasoline and diesel. Industry consumption has increased slightly in recent years and 
accounted for around 28% of the total in 2019. The service sector and agriculture accounted 
for another 7%, with the remainder attributed to the residential and energy sectors.
Until 2009, fuel oil was a major source of power and heat production, but it has since been 
phased out. Following a 2002 presidential decree, most oil-fired power plants were 
modernised and switched to natural gas. However, fuel oil can still be used in emergencies. 
In fact, some fuel oil had to be imported to run power plants during 2014-2018 because of 
natural gas shortages. In 2019, a tiny amount of oil was still used in power and heat 
generation.

place of fuel oil in power and heat plants, and today it accounts for more than 90% of the 
country’s electricity generation. The government’s policy of expanding the gas network to 
reach the whole population has led to inexpensive gas becoming the main heating fuel. 
Demand is seasonal: it is lowest in May and June (around 0.7 bcm per month) and highest 
in December-February (around 1.5-1.8 bcm per month).

gas use in 2019, the residential, service and tertiary sectors combined for 33%, industry 
for 8%, the energy industry itself for around 4% (oil and gas extraction, refining and
pipelines), and petrochemical feedstocks for less than 1%. Losses amounted to over 5% 
of total gas supplied to the Azerbaijani market. While the figure for losses is down from a 
peak of 12% in 2009-2010, it is well above the 1% global average.
Although gas use in transport remains very limited, SOCAR has developed compressed 
natural gas vehicle fuels in the Baku area, helping cut oil product imports and reduce fuel 
costs for drivers. Out of Baku’s 2 200 buses, around 600 run on compressed natural gas 
(CNG) (Azernews, 2020).

development and operations were adopted in the 1990s and include (ECS 2011):
 The 1996 Energy Resources Law, which sets out the social, economic and legal bases of 
state policy relating to use of energy resources. 
 The 1998 Subsoil Law, covering subsoil resources in Azerbaijan and within the Azerbaijani 
sector of the Caspian Sea (including, but not limited to, oil and gas). It governs the 
exploration, use, protection, safety and supervision of the use of subsoil resources, and it
stipulates that no person or legal entity may engage in oil or gas exploration and production 
without a licence. Moreover, a production licence must be issued for a particular subsoil 
block.
 The 1998 Energy Law, which complements the Subsoil Law. It regulates the exploration, 
exploitation, production, processing, storage, transportation, distribution and use of all 
“energy materials and products”, including oil and gas. It stipulates that the production 
rights for a specified block are granted exclusively on the basis of a contract, detailing the 
terms and conditions of such a contract and the procedure for its conclusion. 
 The 1998 Law on Gas Supply, concerning all types of gas in Azerbaijan (including natural 
gas) and regulating the industry in various areas, including production, processing, 
transportation, storage, distribution, marketing and use.
 The 1998 Law on Natural Monopolies (amended in 2001), which regulates natural 
monopolies in relevant commodity markets and their relations to consumers and state 
bodies. It applies particularly to monopolies involved in pipeline transportation, storage and 
distribution of natural gas.
 The 1992 Law on the Protection of Foreign Investment, covering the purchase/lease of 
rights to land and natural resources. It deals with the creation of enterprises and 
representative offices wholly owned by foreign investors, and with their participation in JVs 
with Azerbaijani citizens or organisations. It guarantees foreign investors the right to 
repatriate earnings and profits, after payment of all taxes and duties, and provides 
protection against subsequent adverse changes to legal or regulatory regimes (though not 
for legislation on taxation, military defence, national security or environmental protection).
 The 2009 Law on the Application of Special Economic Regulations to Oil and Gas Activity 
for Export Purposes, which provides economic incentives for Azerbaijani suppliers of goods 
and services for oil and gas projects outside the country.
As part of the 2019 push for energy sector reform (see Chapter 2), the Ministry of Energy
(MoE) is preparing a revision of the 1998 Law on Gas Supply that would include a phased 
transition to a gas supply market with the aim of improving overall sector performance. 
The Law on the Regulator is also pending approval. Once in force, it will empower the 
Azerbaijan Energy Regulatory Agency (AERA, established in 2017) to regulate natural gas 
and other utility operations.

been in charge of regulating the oil and gas industry, while the President of Azerbaijan 
directly controlled SOCAR and made all final decisions on contracts with foreign investors. 
When the FEM came into being in 2001, it was given jurisdiction over the state-owned 
energy companies (SOCAR and Azerenergy) and the authority to prepare legislation, 
determine energy policy, set tariffs and ensure energy security. While FEM negotiated 
PSAs, SOCAR still signed the final agreements. 
The MoE was created in 2013 to replace FEM and was given expanded powers to issue 
licences as well as oversee state enterprises and ensure they follow the state's interests. 
It was also put in charge of preparing, negotiating and monitoring PSAs as well as signing 
subsoil agreements. This division of responsibilities was intended to address potential 
conflicts of interest with SOCAR that had previously existed. It is not clear, however, 
whether the MoE is fully exercising these powers yet (Wood Mackenzie, 2020).
With the establishment of AERA in December 2017 and the pending Law on the Regulator, 
the government is taking steps to more clearly separate energy policymaking and oversight 
of the state-owned monopoly. This is consistent with the market reform objective of the 
pending revision of the Law on Gas Supply (see above).
Retail tariffs 
The Tariff Council sets the wholesale and retail prices of all oil products and natural gas 
(and electricity and district heat) except for imports of premium gasoline, the price of which 
is determined by retailers. 
Retail prices for oil products and natural gas are not directly linked to the international 
market. While various methods exist to set energy tariffs, they are generally determined 
based on a “cost-plus” methodology. By international standards, gasoline and diesel prices 
in Azerbaijan are very low, but they are in line with those of many other producing 
countries. Retail oil prices are changed relatively seldom, and the changes appear to lack 
transparency, despite their substantial impacts on consumers. In January 2015, the Tariff 
Council increased the retail price per litre of AI-92 gasoline from AZN 0.70 to AZN 0.72 
(USD 0.42) and that of diesel from AZN 0.60 to AZN 0.62 (USD 0.36). In July 2017, at the 
request of SOCAR, the Tariff Council increased the retail price per litre of AI-92 gasoline 
by AZN 0.2 to AZN 0.90 (USD 0.52). In July 2020, SOCAR hiked the price of imported 
premium Euro-95 gasoline from AZN 1.1 to AZN 1.2 per litre to align it with import costs 
(Ona, 2020). The Tariff Council raised the retail price of RON-92 gasoline to AZN 1 
(USD 0.59) and that of diesel to AZN 0.8 (USD 0.47) per litre in January 2021. 
Natural gas tariffs have been relatively stable and are among the lowest in the region 
(Figure 3.9). There were few price adjustments during 2008-2019, and the latest changes 
relate to the introduction of “inclining block tariffs”. The preferential limit for residential gas 
tariffs was increased from 1 500 cubic metres per year (m3/a) to 1 700 m3/a in December 
2016 and further to 2 200 m3/a in May 2019. As a result of these changes, more than 
1.8 million subscribers and more than 7 million citizens are now in the lowest price 
category, and the proportion of gas subscribers in this category has increased from 70% 
to 85%.

exporting countries as the difference between export prices and domestic end-user prices. 
This price-gap analysis therefore puts the cost of Azerbaijan’s annual oil subsidies at 
around USD 900 million and gas subsidies at around USD 600 million in 2017-2019 (see 
Chapter 2). For example, the average gas export price in 2019 was USD 190 (AZN 330)
per 1 000 m3, which was significantly higher than the tariffs for domestic consumers (Table 
3.3).

SOCAR owns and operates Azerbaijan's domestic crude oil pipeline system, which 
comprises over 770 km of onshore and 1 975 km of offshore pipelines and nine pump 
stations. 
Overall, Azerbaijan has some 7.1 mb of storage capacity for crude oil, condensate and oil 
products, equalling less than ten days of their combined production. The storage is for 
operational purposes, and most of the capacity is at the terminals of Sangachal (4.0 mb) 
and Dubendi (2.2 mb). Other storage facilities include Ali-Bairamly (four tanks of 35 kb 
each), Dashgil (two tanks of 140 kb each), Puta (six tanks of 35 kb each) and Surakhany 
(six tanks of 35 kb and three tanks of 14 kb each).
Gas transportation and storage 
SOCAR subsidiary Azerigaz owns and operates the domestic gas pipeline system and 
implements the state programme of expanding gas supply to the country's municipalities. 
The gas supply system includes around 4 500 km of trunk lines and more than 36 000 km 
of low- and medium-pressure distribution grids, 7 compressor stations and 150 gas 
distribution stations. In 2019, around 1 700 km of new lines were added, and 680 km of 
the existing grid (less than 2% of the total length) refurbished. Losses remain high by 
international standards at more than 5% of total gas supplied.
Azerbaijan has two underground gas storage facilities, both in depleted gas reservoirs: the 
1.5-bcm Galmaz (75 km south-west of Baku) and the 2-bcm Garadagh. In May 2019, a 
new compressor station at Galmaz boosted storage capacity by 0.5 bcm and pumping 
capacity by 30% to 13 mcm/day, helping to meet demand during peak winter periods and 
facilitating the transportation of Azerbaijani gas. Gas storage also helps minimise the 
effects of any production outages. SOCAR is considering action to expand total capacity 
at Galmaz and Garadagh to 5 bcm by increasing operating pressures. 
Downstream 
In addition to oil and gas production, storage and transportation, SOCAR is involved in oil 
refining, gas processing and petrochemicals production at several locations. It also has a 
monopoly in gas retail, but not in oil retail, where there is market competition. SOCAR has 
modernised and expanded its production facilities in recent years, and it is planning a 
major integrated oil, gas and petrochemical complex (OGPC) in Garadagh, close to the 
Sangachal terminal (see Box 3.3).
 All rights reserved.company in terms of tax revenue, employment and international presence. 
SOCAR explores for oil and gas; produces, transports, processes and refines oil, gas, and 
gas condensate; negotiates contracts for the state; markets oil products and 
petrochemicals in both domestic and international markets; and supplies natural gas to 
industry and the public in Azerbaijan. It has a domestic market monopoly in natural gas 
and in oil refining and oil product distribution. It also has subdivisions and trusts operating 
as corporate entities (SOCAR, 2020). Overseas, SOCAR owns a refinery in Turkey, has 
oil product marketing activities in several countries (Georgia, Turkey, Romania, 
Switzerland, Germany and Ukraine) and international oil trading offices.9
SOCAR holds the state’s stakes in all upstream PSAs and RSCs in Azerbaijan as well as 
in oil and gas export pipelines. Other international partners in the PSAs often carry 
SOCAR's financial obligations through one or more contract phases (e.g. the exploration 
phase).
It also participates in around 30 JVs, such as the Caspian Drilling Company (offshore 
drilling operations), Cross Caspian Oil and Gas Logistics LLC, Azfen (construction), Baku 
Shipyard LLC, BOSShelf LLC (offshore construction), Oil and Gas ProServ LLC, SOCAR 
Foster Wheeler Engineering Service, SOCAR KBR, and SOCAR Petrofac.
The state company’s oil output has averaged around 150 kbd since 2016, equivalent to 
roughly 20% of Azerbaijani output. Its production is relatively stable, and its share in 
overall production has been rising slightly. SOCAR’s oil production costs averaged 
USD 9.37/bl in 2018, up 5.8% from 2017. SOCAR’s gross natural gas output has averaged 
around 6.4 bcm/a since 2016, or a bit more than one-fifth of Azerbaijani output. 
SOCAR’s revenues, which come mainly from the ACG and Shah Deniz fields, amounted 
to USD 49 billion in 2019, with a net profit of USD 382 million. International sales and 
trading (conducted through SOCAR Trading in Switzerland) accounted for 76% of total 
revenues. By product category, most revenue (61%) came from crude oil sales, 26.5% 
from oil products, 4.7% from petrochemical products, and 4.9% from natural gas (SOCAR, 
2020). 
The Azerbaijani state continues to provide financial and strategic support to SOCAR. The 
government supports the company through investments, subsidies, loans and tax breaks, 
and by facilitating the raising of capital. In turn, SOCAR pays taxes, invests and supplies 
oil and natural gas domestically at prices that the government sets substantially below 
world market prices. In his August 2020 speech about liberalising the economy, President 
Aliyev called for broader reforms in the sphere of privatisation (BRI, 2020).

total refinery runs have fluctuated from 115 kbd to 130 kbd, averaging 120 kbd.
The HAR produces liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), gasoline, kerosene and diesel, primarily 
for the domestic market, as well as low-sulphur coke. Its output meets most Azerbaijani 
needs for heavy fuel oil and light products, except for small shares of gasoline and 
kerosene. The HAR also provides feedstock for the Azerikimya complex in Sumgayit, north 
of Baku. 
To accommodate closure of the Azerneftyag refinery and to add bitumen blowing capacity 
to maintain asphalt production, HAR capacity is being expanded. The renovation project, 
which includes upgrading as well as expansion, is expected to be completed in 2023 and 
increase throughput up to 7.5 Mt/a, or 150 kbd (SOCAR, 2021). It will reduce import 
requirements and boost gasoline and diesel quality from Euro 2 to Euro 5, which will also 
help improve air quality in and around Baku (BRI, 2020). The upgrades will ensure HAR’s 
reliable operations for another 15 years – long enough to integrate an entirely new refinery 
at the gas processing and petrochemicals production complex planned to be constructed 
in Garadagh (see below). 
Gas processing and monetisation 
Azerbaijan’s gas processing capacity has been expanded to accommodate its rise in gas 
production, and it now totals around 25 bcm/a. Gas is processed at two facilities: the 
Sangachal terminal (around 18 bcm/a; see Box 3.2) and Garadagh (6.5 bcm/a). The 
Garadagh gas processing plant is linked to a 2-bcm gas storage facility, and both are 
operated by SOCAR. The Garadagh plant produces dry gas, natural gasoline, butane, a 
propane-butane mixture, heavy condensates, and other products (SOCAR, 2020). Despite 
several expansions and upgrades since being commissioned in 1961, it is now relatively 
old and there are plans to replace it with a new 10-bcm/a plant in the Garadagh OGPC 
(see below).
Having ample gas supplies has allowed Azerbaijan to develop industrial activities to 
monetise the gas at three facilities: the SOCAR Methanol plant (also in Garadagh) and the 
SOCAR Azerikimya and SOCAR Carbamide complexes in Sumgayit. There are plans to 
replace the Sumgayit complexes with new capacity to be built at the Garadagh OGPC.
 The SOCAR Methanol plant was commissioned in 2013. It has a capacity of 650-700 kt/a 
of high-purity methanol. Production is mostly exported to Turkey, Western Europe and the 
Mediterranean region (SOCAR, 2020). 
 The SOCAR Azerikimya complex holds an ethylene-polyethylene plant (EP-300) and a 
polymer plant as well as an isopropyl alcohol production unit. It also produces steam and 
electricity (32 MW capacity). Plant modernisation in 2017-2021 boosted production 
capacity and product quality, and in 2018 the complex produced over 337 kt of products 
such as polyethylene, ethylene, propylene, liquid and heavy pyrolysis resin, butanebutylene fractions and absolute isopropyl alcohol. Around 70% of production is exported, 
including to Turkey, Russia, the Caucasus, Central Asia, Eastern and Western Europe, 
China and Viet Nam (MENAFN, 2019).
 All rights reserved.Garadagh oil, gas and petrochemical complex
SOCAR is planning to build an integrated OGPC in Garadagh, 15 km south of Baku. The 
complex would be built in phases, with the first one comprising a gas processing plant 
(10 bcm/a) and several petrochemical plants: a gas-powered ethylene pyrolysis plant 
(610 kt/a), a propylene plant (130 kt/a) and a polyethylene plant (600 kt/a) as well as 
Butene-1 and Hexene-1 plants and a heat and power plant. The complex plans to use the 
NGLs recovered from gas plants as a low-cost feedstock. SOCAR has not made a final 
investment decision on the project. A possible second phase would include an oil refinery 
complex able to produce Euro 5-compliant diesel and gasoline. 
The integrated complex is designed to increase the hydrocarbon sector’s production 
capacity, improve product quality, expand product range and generally raise the valueadded revenues Azerbaijan derives from its oil and gas resources. It would also enable 
SOCAR to shut down and demolish old facilities in Baku and Sumgayit, which would make
the areas available for urban development and reduce potential health risks to the 
population. 
Retail oil market 
Unlike retail gas supply, retail oil supply is not under a monopoly. Retail prices for diesel 
and RON-92 gasoline are set by the government, but prices for imported RON-95 follow 
international market rates. Azpetrol is the largest retail oil supplier, with 94 fuel stations at 
the end of 2020, while Lukoil has around 70 and SOCAR has 35 (Petrolplaza, 2020). A 
growing number of fuel stations also offer CNG.
Retail gas market 
The domestic gas market has been operated by SOCAR’s subsidiary Azerigaz since 2009. 
The company transports, distributes and markets natural gas in Azerbaijan, and, through 
its Gas Export Department, it also exports SOCAR gas to Georgia, Iran and Russia. In 
2019, the company transported a total of 12.6 bcm within or outside the country, supplying
2 247 000 natural gas customers – 31 000 of which are non-residential, including the gasfired power plants that generated 92% of Azerbaijan’s electricity in 2019. All the natural 
gas prices are set by the government (the Tariff Council) at a very low level by international 
standards (Finans, 2019).
In a recent move, the government adopted on 28 December 2020 a decision to restructure 
the domestic natural gas supply. The decision entrusts the state-owned company 
Azercontract with organising natural gas purchases from producers and its transportation, 
distribution and sale to the domestic consumers from 1 January 2021. According to the 
decision, Azercontract will buy natural gas from producers and sell it to Azerigaz for 
domestic use.

processing facilities and main pipelines. SOCAR has its own emergency response system 
for emergency situations.
As a net exporter of oil and gas with domestic refining and storage capacity, Azerbaijan 
has not developed emergency storage or stock monitoring systems. The country has 
mitigated the risk of supply/demand shocks by diversifying its export routes and its oil 
product import sources. 
Assessment 
Azerbaijan’s economy and energy supply depend heavily on oil and gas. The two fuels
bring in around 90% of the country’s export revenue and finance around 60% of the 
government budget. They also supply 98% of primary energy and more than 90% of the 
country’s electricity.
Oil and, more recently, gas have been largely responsible for the significant increase in 
the living standards in Azerbaijan since the late 1990s. At the same time, their dominance 
of the economy has left the country exposed to swings in global oil prices. After the oil 
price decline in 2014-2015 resulted in a contraction of GDP, the government launched 
measures to stimulate other sectors of the economy. These efforts are gradually bearing 
fruit, with non-petroleum economic activity rising to 59% of GDP in 2018. The global 
economic recession of 2020 and the collapse in oil prices in spring 2020 underline the 
importance of further efforts to diversify the economy. 
The government is also preparing to reform the gas and electricity markets to increase 
economic efficiency. The major question is how to increase efficiency, attract investments 
and new entrants and diversify the energy supply in the current context of heavily 
subsidised natural gas prices. 
Role of gas set to increase as oil production declines 
Oil production, which had already begun in the mid-19th century, peaked at over 1 mbd of 
crude and 40 kbd of gas condensate in 2009-2010, and has gradually declined since then. 
By 2019, crude production had fallen to 779 kbd, only partly offset by growth in condensate 
output to 80 kbd. In 2020, as part of the OPEC+ response to the Covid-19 impact on oil 
demand, Azerbaijan agreed to cut production from 720 kbd in October 2019 to an average 
of 580 kbd from June to December 2020. In 2021, OPEC+ has decreased the production 
cuts, enabling Azerbaijan to gradually increase its production to 620 kbd in July 2021.
In contrast to the decline in oil production, natural gas production continues to increase. 
Most gas comes from the Shah Deniz field, where Phase 1 production started in the mid2000s and helped turn the country from a gas importer into an exporter. Production started 
at Shah Deniz 2 in 2018, and the field will reach full production – around 16 bcm/a – by 
2022, helping lift the country’s total output from 24 bcm in 2019 to around 28 bcm/a in 
2022-2023. Further increases from other fields towards 2030 are foreseen. 
Shah Deniz 2, a development of international significance, is the gas source for the SGC 
project, which transports Caspian gas across Georgia and Turkey to Europe. The 16 bcm/a 
 All rights reserved.Azerbaijan is an important and reliable gas exporter that, through the SGC, has helped
Europe diversify its gas supply routes and improve gas security. This is significant, as 
domestic production in Europe is steadily declining at the same time as the IEA anticipates 
European demand to rise importantly, by around 45 bcm/a by 2025 (IEA, 2020c). With 
capacity increases, the SGC could transport twice what Shah Deniz 2 can produce, which
could open the way to Azerbaijan becoming a regional gas hub. Azerbaijan’s 
interconnected gas system and the seasonal swings in its gas demand add to this 
potential.
Azerbaijan has succeeded in creating a stable upstream oil and gas investment climate: 
PSA terms have been maintained and companies have had tax stability. The best example 
is the ACG contract area (developed under the 1994 Contract of the Century between the 
government and a BP-led consortium), which is the source of around 70% of the country’s 
crude oil production and more than USD 140 billion in government revenue since 1997 
(Azernews, 2019). It also contains almost 70% of the country’s remaining commercial 
liquids. In 2017, Azerbaijan reached a major milestone when it extended the ACG PSA 
from 2024 to the end of 2049, an additional 25 years.
At 2019 production levels, Azerbaijan’s oil reserves will last for up to 25 years and its gas 
reserves for up to 79 (see Table 3.1). However, despite projects to develop natural gas 
and condensate production in upcoming years, a steady decline in liquids output seems 
likely without significant reforms to make oil exploration and production more attractive.
Azerbaijan’s future success as an internationally competitive producer will depend on how 
well it manages the costs of new developments. The focus should be on collaborative 
access to resources and contracting strategies as well as local capability development, 
notably in digital technologies. In addition, an important emerging factor is the 
environmental footprint of production (see below).
In the short and medium term, Azerbaijan’s position as a gas exporter may become 
stronger, with domestic production in Europe declining faster than demand and many IOCs 
indicating that they will gradually switch their focus from oil and gas to clean energy and 
electricity. However, the long-term outlook for exports – and therefore for government 
revenue – is uncertain, as importing countries increasingly adopt ambitious policies to limit 
GHG emissions.
Global push for clean energy will affect oil and gas revenues
Several of the world’s largest energy importers (the European Union, Japan and South 
Korea) have recently pledged to reduce GHG emissions to net-zero by 2050, and China 
is aiming for the same by 2060. These targets imply little demand for oil or gas without 
carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) three decades from now. Technology 
breakthroughs and policy changes in other importing countries may further accelerate this 
transition, and competition for export opportunities among producing countries may well 
intensify, raising the risk of many oil and gas assets becoming stranded. 
 All rights reserved.ENERGY SEC
deplete the fund in just six years. To enlarge its financial buffer, the government could 
consider saving a higher share of oil and gas revenues in the fund and find ways to raise 
the relatively low average rate of return (1.8%/a from 2010 to 2019) of the fund’s 
investments.
In its efforts to manage Azerbaijan’s oil and gas resources, the government could look to 
Norway for inspiration. It is worth noting that, while natural gas fuels almost all electricity
production and space heating in Azerbaijan, Norway exports practically all the gas it 
produces, generating almost all its electricity from renewable sources and using that 
electricity to heat its buildings. Azerbaijan has excellent untapped renewable energy 
potential and could consider aiming for something similar (see Chapter 8). Azerbaijan’s 
2030 target of roughly doubling the share of renewable energy to 30% of total electricity 
generating capacity is a welcome move in the right direction. 
The government should also prepare for the possibility of importing countries gradually 
placing stricter requirements on the GHG intensity of oil and gas production. SOCAR 
succeeded in eliminating gas flaring altogether in 2020 (see Chapter 6), and it is also 
working to reduce methane emissions with its partner companies and in its own activities. 
An additional way to reduce GHG intensity would be to integrate low-carbon electricity into 
oil and gas production. The IEA encourages the government to continue working closely 
with leading companies operating in the country’s oil and gas sector to reduce sectoral 
emissions to help meet Azerbaijan’s 2030 climate targets. Most of the IOCs operating in 
Azerbaijan have set net-zero targets; for example, BP will have to implement measures to 
reduce emissions associated with production and consumption in Azerbaijan. The 
government should therefore develop a strategy that encompasses IOC plans to discover
what it would mean for the country.
To increase value-added production from Azerbaijan’s oil and gas resources, SOCAR has 
recently increased and modernised its petrochemicals capacity, helping to eliminate 
imports, create new exports and reduce local pollution. This work continues with plans to 
construct the Garadagh integrated OGPC. As the complex would replace facilities currently
located close to cities, it would improve the safety and air quality of those populations and 
the IEA therefore encourages constructing the OGPC. 
Beyond being used to produce petrochemicals, natural gas could also be converted into 
fuels such as hydrogen, using CCUS to avoid emissions. As hydrogen is increasingly being 
recognised as a decarbonisation option, its global demand may begin to grow quickly, 
potentially providing an opportunity for Azerbaijan to diversify its exports. Because CCUS 
technology could be used both to help mitigate CO2 emissions from gas processing and 
oil refining and to enhance oil recovery, its potential in Azerbaijan should be studied.
One further way to increase oil and gas revenue is to raise the efficiency of domestic 
transportation, distribution and use. Reducing leakage by investing in pipelines would help, 
as would reducing currently high oil and gas subsidies: this would encourage energy 
efficiency investments, save energy for other uses and strengthen incentives for clean 
 All rights reserved.Domestically, oil and gas provide 98% of primary energy, and gas is used for more than 
90% of electricity generation. SOCAR controls all segments of the oil and gas sector apart 
from retail oil supply. Efficiency could be increased by introducing competition, reforming 
tariffs to at least cover supply costs and eliminate cross-subsidies, and abolishing 
SOCAR’s role in social and employment policy.
To improve sector performance, the IEA encourages the government to consider 
transitioning gradually to a liberalised domestic market, particularly for gas. As a very 
welcome first step, the regulator (AERA) was established in December 2017. Next, in the 
interests of transparency, the government should ensure AERA’s independence from the 
MoE, the policy maker, and grant it the legal right to take binding decisions and issue gas 
market rules and network codes, including on tariffs. 
The government is preparing to revise the Law on Gas Supply, and the IEA encourages it 
to model gas market reform on international best practices. At minimum, network 
operations should be separated from gas production and sales, and non-discriminatory 
third-party access to the network should be allowed. The level of ambition and the pace of 
reform need to be consistent with electricity market reform measures, given that subsidised 
gas is the dominant fuel for electricity production and that low tariffs on gas used for power
generation make renewable energy and efficiency measures less appealing. Even lower 
gas prices for households disincentivise other heating options, such as gas-based 
combined generation of power, district heating and cooling (see Chapter 5).
Regardless of how open the market is, it is essential that regulations enable operational 
profitability. As in many other producer countries, Azerbaijan’s government has chosen to 
subsidise citizens and businesses by providing low-cost energy in the form of oil, natural 
gas, electricity and district heat. This tariff policy leads to the inefficient use of natural 
resources that could (and should) be better used elsewhere. 
The availability of artificially inexpensive gasoline and diesel encourages citizens to 
purchase inefficient vehicles, and the impacts of this policy will become more obvious – 
and the implied subsidies larger – as the car fleet continues to expand. In the gas sector, 
subsidies help gas outcompete other, potentially more efficient, options for generating heat 
and electricity (see Chapters 4 and 5). Gas tariffs that do not cover costs not only constrain 
SOCAR/Azerigaz financially, they undermine incentives to improve gas networks and, if 
markets are opened to competition, discourage new entrants.
The currently low tariffs reduce SOCAR’s profits and the autonomy of its decision-making, 
as does the retention of significant labour surpluses. To help improve the financial viability 
of SOCAR, and that of Azerbaijan’s domestic energy supply in general, the government 
should gradually eliminate state-owned energy companies’ involvement in social 
protection and employment policy. Instead of subsidising oil and gas prices for all 
consumers, the government should provide direct support to low-income and vulnerable 
ones. Paying a fair market price would motivate consumers to use energy more efficiently
and provide a clear incentive for suppliers to improve productivity. Oil and gas saved 
through improved efficiency could be exported at much higher prices or turned into highervalue-added petrochemicals.

Overview
Azerbaijan’s electricity supply relies on the country’s ample natural gas resources. The 
electricity system is dominated by state-owned monopolies, and the government sets all 
wholesale and retail prices. 
Investments are needed to modernise and expand generating capacity and networks to 
ensure security of supply and enable electricity demand growth. Electricity market reform 
is being undertaken to attract private sector investment and increase efficiency, and 
several laws and other legal instruments have been drafted and are awaiting approval.
Meanwhile, the country’s significant solar and wind power potential could be harnessed to 
meet several energy policy goals simultaneously. The government has recently set a target 
for renewable energy to provide 30% of generating capacity by 2030, around twice the 
current share. 
Supply and demand
Over the past 15 years, increased domestic natural gas production has led to the 
installation of new gas-fired generating capacity to replace oil-fired capacity and to meet 
expected electricity demand growth. Today, more than 90% of Azerbaijan’s electricity is 
generated at flexible natural gas plants and network losses have fallen from 11.7% of total 
supply in 2015 to less than 10% in 2019. Electricity consumption has grown only modestly
(averaging 2.5% per year since 2013), and the country has also begun to use its 
generating capacity for exports (Figure 4.1).

network losses have declined and exports increased.

Generation
Azerbaijan’s gross electricity generation reached 26.1 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2019, up 
20% from 2008. Natural gas is the main source of electricity, at 92% in 2019 (ten-year 
average 88%). Hydropower accounted for 6% (ten-year average 9%) and other renewable 
sources (solar, wind and waste) for 1% of total generation (Figure 4.2). Co-generation1
plants generated 7.5 TWh of electricity, or 31% of the total in 2019.
In the first eight months of 2020, electricity generation was 0.7% lower than during the 
same period in 2019. The decline can be linked to the impact of Covid-19 on economic 
activity, but the decline is mild compared with other countries (MoE, 2020c).

A major switch from mostly fuel oil-based generation to natural gas started in the early 
2000s. Since then, the share of oil in the electricity supply has dropped rapidly, and fuel 
oil is currently used only as an emergency fuel (Figure 4.3).

Capacity 
Azerbaijan’s installed generation capacity stood at 7.6 gigawatts (GW) at the end of 2019. 
Gas-fired power plants accounted for around 83% of the total, followed by hydropower 
plants (HPPs) at 15% (Table 4.1). All large HPPs are connected to reservoirs, but none 
has pumped storage facilities. The combined capacity of solar PV and wind power totalled 
0.1 GW in 2019. Total capacity has increased by 2.4 GW from 2005, or by half. Around 
90% of these capacity additions are gas-fired.
However, further capacity additions are on the way. A 385-megawatt (MW) modular gasfired power plant in the Gobu district is expected to be commissioned in 2022. The 36-MW 
Ordubad HPP in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic is also under construction, and 
the Ministry of Energy (MoE) is in talks with international energy companies about building 
a private combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) of up to 550 MW.

State-owned Azerenergy owns around 85% of the country’s generating capacity, including 
the 2 400-MW gas-fired Azerbaijan Thermal Power Plant (TPP) and the 424-MW 
Mingachevir HPP in Mingachevir, a key city for electricity generation. In total, 92% of all 
installed capacity belongs to state-owned companies. Private companies, mainly 
autoproducers at oil and gas facilities, had a capacity of around 600 MW in 2019.
According to the Energy Charter Secretariat (ECS), peak demand in the Unified Energy 
System of Azerbaijan (i.e. without the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic) was around 
3 700 MW in 2017. Thus, the system’s installed capacity of around 6 800 MW exceeds 
domestic demand considerably. This is due partly to the unanticipated slowdown in 
economic growth (and therefore in electricity demand) that followed the oil price drop of 
2014-2015 (ECS, 2020). As a result, capacity factors for TPPs are rather low. According 
to the SSC, they averaged 37.3% from 2011 to 2019, ranging from 34.6% in 2017 to 41.3% 
in 2012 (SSC, 2020). Azerbaijan’s electricity system is thus dominated by relatively new 
CCGT and gas engine plants that are underutilised. 
Prioritising the use of the most efficient power plants and, correspondingly, avoiding the 
use of the least efficient ones, would raise fleet-wide plant efficiency. In fact, the Energy 
Charter Secretariat has calculated that making electricity generation more energy-efficient 
would save the sector around two billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas per year and would 
also reduce CO2 emissions by 4.8 million tonnes (Mt) per year (ECS, 2020).

Consumption
Electricity consumption totalled 21.6 TWh in 2019, one-quarter more than in 2008, but 
relatively unchanged since 2014 (Figure 4.6). The residential sector accounted for 30% 
of the total and the service sector for 29%. From 2008 to 2019, commercial sector 
electricity consumption rose 72% while residential use actually fell 14% as a result of a 
tariff increase in 2016, the installation of meters and more assiduous bill collection. The 
commercial sector is expected to drive demand in the medium term.
Industry was the third-largest electricity consumer, at 20% of the total (+36% since 
2008), followed by energy industries (14%, +178% since 2008) and agriculture (5%, 
+79% since 2008). Electricity consumption for transport, which accounted for just 2% of 
the total, has decreased by one-third since 2008 as rail travel has declined.

Electricity generation is closely linked to domestic demand, which peaks in winter for 
heating (the peak month is January) and in summer for cooling (the peak occurs around 
July) (Figure 4.7). Historically, the winter peak (averaging 2 150 gigawatt hours 
(GWh)/month) has been higher than the summer peak (around 2 000 GWh/month).

Electricity sector structure and reform 
Azerbaijan is at an early stage of liberalising its electricity sector. The state-owned 
vertically integrated monopolies Azerenergy and Azerishiq continue to dominate the sector 
and the government still sets the wholesale and retail electricity prices, but a new electricity 
market law promoting liberalisation was drafted recently and its approval is now pending.

transmission and distribution systems are directly operated by the Nakhchivan Energy 
Authority. Azerishiq OJSC (formerly Bakielektrikshebeke OJSC, i.e. Baku Electric 
Company), was created in 2015 when the government passed Azerenergy’s distribution 
assets and functions to this new company as the first step towards market reform.

Source: INOGATE Technical Secretariat (2016) as modified by IRENA (2019).
Azerenergy and Azerishiq receive government budget support to implement part of their 
capital expenditure programmes. According to the MoE, state capital investments from 
2015 to 2019 amounted to USD 397 million for Azerenergy and USD 601 million for 
Azerishıq. The companies need this government financial support both because their 
tariffs are set at a level that keeps services affordable and because they have significantly 
more employees than they need for optimum efficiency, as state-owned enterprises often 
serve social protection and employment policy purposes (ADB, 2020). 
The 1998 Law on the Power Industry provides the legal basis for the electricity sector. It 
sets out some provisions for third-party access so that Azerenergy can purchase electricity 
from other generators, and other entities can buy electricity from Azerenergy (or other state 
companies) and sell it to end-consumers in their own grids or through the state 
transmission system. In practice, these arrangements account for around 1% of electricity 
generation.
The 2016 Strategic Roadmap
Following the global oil price decline in 2014-2015 and the subsequent recession in 
Azerbaijan, its government set out to reform the economy, drawing up plans for the 
electricity sector as part of this task. The 2016 Strategic Roadmap for the Development of 
 All rights reserved.ENERGY SEC
The Roadmap proposed eliminating end-user subsidies and introducing differentiated enduser tariffs for different times of the day. It also included several quantitative targets for 
2020, including for example to reduce distribution losses, add 1.9 GW of conventional 
power plant capacity and 420 MW of renewable electricity capacity, and increase the 
efficiency of combined-cycle power plants from 47% to 50%.
Following a recommendation in the Roadmap, the Azerbaijan Energy Regulatory Agency 
(AERA) was established in December 2017. AERA reports to the MoE and covers the 
electricity, natural gas and heat sectors. Its functions include licensing and the 
development and submission of proposals on tariff design and methodology. Its precise 
roles and responsibilities will be clarified in the Law on the Regulator for which adoption is 
pending (see next section).
Since 2016, generating efficiency has continued to improve, network infrastructure has 
been modernised and the bill collection rate has increased. Nevertheless, many of the 
suggested reforms have yet to be implemented, and the three key electricity sector 
challenges identified by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 2016 remain valid: 
improving operational and financial efficiency; restoring and maintaining high levels of 
service throughout the country; and establishing a sustainable cost recovery financing 
mechanism (ADB, 2016b). 
Current reform plans
The Order of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan on the Acceleration of Reforms 
in the Energy Sector of the Republic of Azerbaijan was adopted in May 2019 to boost 
reform efforts. It broadly reiterates the 2016 market reform ideas and sets timetables for 
preparing electricity sector laws and regulations. 
According to the MoE, the government’s aim is to establish a transparent, competitive and 
open electricity market to which access will be allowed on a fair and equal basis. 
Government subsidies and expenditures will gradually be eliminated and renewable 
energy used to diversify the electricity supply and reduce dependence on natural gas 
(MoE, 2020a).
The government drafted several laws for electricity market reform that were awaiting 
adoption in December 2020, including on the development of the electricity market; on the 
role and responsibilities of the regulator in energy and public utility services; and on the 
use of renewable energy in electricity generation (see Chapter 8). Agreements for power 
purchases and sales, investments, transmission network connections and land leases 
have also been drafted with the help of international consultants (MoE, 2020b).
The Law on the Regulator, modelled on the EU Third Energy Package, sets out the 
regulator’s main activities as tariff setting, licensing, market monitoring, and settling 
disputes and customer claims. Proposals have also been drafted for tariff methodology 
and for accelerating reforms in the heating sector. Business models for co-generation of 
power and heat and trigeneration of power, heat and cooling are also covered in the draft 
Law on Electricity (see Chapter 5).
 All rights reserved.possible privatisation, Azerenergy’s power plants will be separated into individual 
companies. A plan has also been drafted to privatise the renewable electricity capacity of 
Azeralternative LLC (16 MW) and some modular thermal capacity, while public-private 
partnerships are planned for building gas-fired capacity (MoE, 2020a). 
The MoE has also stated that the government aims to raise the share of renewable energy 
in total electricity generation capacity to 30% by 2030, roughly doubling the 2018 share of 
16%. The Ministry has identified eight potential areas for the construction of solar and wind 
power facilities (100-200 MW each) and plans to use auctions to choose project 
participants. It has also signed memorandums of understanding (MoUs) to co-operate on 
renewable energy ventures with 11 large companies, including BP, Equinor, Total, Masdar 
and ACWA Power (MoE, 2020b). In January 2020, the MoE signed implementing 
agreements with ACWA Power to build, own and operate 240 MW of wind capacity and 
with Masdar for 230 MW of solar capacity. Project agreements, including 20-year PPAs, 
were signed in December 2020 with ACWA Power and in March 2021 with Masdar (see 
Chapter 8).
Networks 
Transmission and distribution
Azerbaijan’s high-voltage network totals around 7 800 km: 1 505 km at 220 kV; 31 km at 
230 kV; 1 542 km at 330 kV; and 477 km at 500 kV (Table 4.2). The network has 93 highvoltage substations.
Although the distribution system’s voltage is generally below 110 kV, in some cases both 
the transmission system operator (TSO) and the distribution system operator (DSO) 
operate at the 110-kV level. The total installed capacity of the substations operated by the 
DSO Azerishiq exceeds 10 000 megavolt amperes (MVA).

Efforts to reduce network losses are delivering results. From 2015 to 2019, the percentage 
of transmission losses in total electricity supply fell from 2.1% to 1.5%, and distribution 
losses from 9.6% to 7.5% (SSC, 2020). Azerishiq is carrying out a programme to 
rehabilitate distribution network substations and lines, replace low-quality customer

identified the requirements for international standards covering energy system 
management, power transmission, relay protection and automation, and network 
strengthening (MoE, 2020b). 
The German company VPC has been contracted to determine technical options to 
increase the share of renewable energy in electricity generation capacity to 30% by 2030. 
It has been studying network connection opportunities for pilot projects and to determine 
measures for network integration and strengthening (MoE, 2020b; see Chapter 8).
Cross-border connections
Azerbaijan’s power system is interconnected with those of Georgia, Turkey, Russia and 
Iran. Cross-border flows are operated and metered by Azerenergy and governed by 
bilateral agreements. 
Azerbaijan’s electricity system is synchronised with Russia’s Integrated Power 
System/Unified Power System (IPS/UPS), as is Georgia’s. Iran will be synchronised with 
the IPS/UPS once grid compatibility studies have been completed in 2021 (FNA, 2020). 
Azerbaijan has two cross-border connections with Georgia: the 500-kV (700 MW) 
Samukh-Gardabani and the 330-kV Agstafa-Gardabani lines. The 500-kV line is part of 
the AGT Power Bridge. The lines from Azerbaijan to Georgia and from Georgia to Turkey 
were all completed in 2013 and power transmission started in 2016. A second 330-kV 
connection being added to the 330-kV (670 MW) Agstafa-Gardabani line is expected to 
become operational in 2022 (IEA, 2020b).
With Turkey, Azerbaijan has three cross-border connections in the Nakhchivan 
Autonomous Republic: the 154-kV Igdir-Babek 1 and 2 lines and the 34.5-kV AdaliqSadarak.
Cross-border capacity with Russia is around 350 MW and the main connection is the 
330-kV Yashma- Derbent line; the other connection, the 110-kV Yalama-Bilici line, is 
seldom used. Negotiations are under way to develop a second 330-kV Absheron-Derbent 
air transmission line with Russia as well as a Russia-Azerbaijan-Iran electricity corridor.
Azerbaijan’s five cross-border connections with Iran are the 330-kV Mugan line, the 230-kV 
Imishli and 110-kV Astara-Astara lines, owned by Azerenergy, and the 132-kV Araz-Araz 
and 132-kV Julfa-Julfa lines, owned by the Nakhchivan Energy Authority. Mugan, the main 
connection, began operations in 2016. Total cross-border capacity with Iran is 600 MW 
(MoE, 2020). A 220-kV Masalli connection is also being constructed. 
System operation
Azerenergy’s Central Dispatching Department (CDD) operates Azerbaijan’s transmission 
system. It uses a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system to manage, 
control and optimise the system in real time.
 All rights reserved.Prices and tariffs 
The Tariff Council sets electricity prices for generators and consumers in a variety of 
categories (Table 4.3). In practice, the tariffs for producers are feed-in tariffs for small 
renewable electricity producers, while the wholesale electricity tariff is what the DSO 
Azerishiq pays to the TSO Azerenergy for electricity. The wholesale tariff thus includes 
payments for electricity generated at Azerenergy’s large hydro and thermal power plants, 
for feed-in tariffs for small producers of renewables for electricity, and for electricity 
transmission to the distribution network. The transit tariff is what Azerishiq pays for the 
transmission of electricity from its three wind power plants.
The several energy-intensive industries that are supplied directly from the transmission 
network are also eligible for daytime and night-time tariffs. 
On the retail side, block tariffs apply to residential consumers and a flat-rate tariff to all 
other consumers, regardless of category, voltage or capacity. Because residential 
electricity tariffs are a social policy instrument (like residential natural gas and district heat 
tariffs), they do not reflect the true cost of service. 
Twice in recent years the government has raised the consumption threshold for the lowest 
tariff (i.e. the category with the highest implied subsidies). In late 2016, it increased the 
threshold from 250 kWh/month to 300 kWh/month, and in April 2020 it was temporarily 
raised to 400 kWh/month for two months in relation to the Covid-19 economic downturn. 
Of Azerbaijan’s 2.6 million electricity customers at the end of 2018, those with monthly use 
of less than 300 kWh were responsible for 28% of total electricity consumption, according 
to the government. 
The tariff system also provides implicit cross-subsidies from urban to rural customers: even 
though retail electricity tariffs, which include compensation for distribution, are the same 
across the whole country, it costs Azerishiq much more to supply rural customers than 
urban ones. Essentially, demand per customer is lower and capital costs higher in the 
countryside. This type of cross-subsidisation that reflects social policy designed to support 
rural communities is common in many countries in which the state is a major shareholder 
in electricity supply companies (ADB, 2016a). 
Overall, the electricity tariff system includes and implies sizeable consumer subsidies. 
Azerenergy’s and Azerishiq’s financial reports are not made public, but the IEA has used 
the commonly applied price-gap methodology to estimate that electricity subsidies from 
2015 to 2019 averaged USD 700 million per year, due mainly to subsidies to keep natural 
gas prices low (see Table 2.1 in Chapter 2). For example, Azerbaijan’s natural gas export 
price averaged USD 190 (AZN 323) per 1 000 m3 in 2019, but the price charged 
domestically for natural gas for electricity generation was much lower at only AZN 120 per 
1 000 m3.

Metering has helped improve the financial performance of the electricity sector. While 
Azerenergy started a programme to install pre-paid end-user meters in 2007, Azerishiq 
took it over in 2015 and the expectation is that all consumers will soon be equipped with smart 
meters. Collection rates reached more than 94% in 2018, a major improvement from around 
50% in 2007.
International comparison shows that in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms, Azerbaijan’s 
residential electricity price is relatively low, but still higher than in Georgia, its main 
electricity export destination (Figure 4.9).

Security of supply 
Azerbaijan has improved its electricity supply security over the past decade with major 
investments to modernise generation and strengthen the east-west transmission system. 
Construction of gas-fired generation capacity has curtailed the electricity shortages that 
used to be common. Electricity supply security relies on use of the country’s abundant 
domestic natural gas as the default energy source and on the establishment of adequate 
national generation capacity. In 2019, Azerbaijan had 7.6 GW of capacity, 6.4 GW of which 
was gas-fired, while peak demand was around 4 GW.
At the same time, more network infrastructure needs to be modernised, and the country 
continues to lack governance and operational security protocols and measures for 
electricity security. Out-of-date technologies and equipment have decreased the reliability 
and efficiency of energy system operations, while the lack of electricity supply reliability 
has been one of the government’s main energy security concerns. The July 2018 
countrywide blackout particularly revealed the urgent need to improve the electricity 
system’s ability to maintain reliability and respond to emergencies (see Box 4.1).
After this blackout, the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan set new priorities for 
Azerenergy to restore the power system’s generating capacity, modernise the substations 
and increase the transmission system’s load capacity. In 2018, the MoE and the German 
company VPC launched a broad programme to meet these goals, and by the end of 2019, 
485 MW of lost power had been restored through power plant rehabilitation. Azerenergy, 
which is still implementing the programme (destined to end in 2021), intends to restore 
1 000 MW of lost power capacity (MoE, 2020a). Pending electricity market reforms also 
aim to boost security of supply by improving the power sector’s financial viability and 
investment capacity. 
However, a regulatory framework for monitoring power quality had yet to be introduced as 
of September 2019. According to AERA, draft rules have been submitted to the 
government to approve the calculations of the System Average Interruption Duration Index 
(SAIDI) and the System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI). The draft rules also

On 3-4 July 2018, Azerbaijan was hit by two blackouts that left most of the country without 
electricity, and in some cases without water, for several hours. Thirty-nine cities and 
districts across the country were affected. 
Azerenergy, the plant’s owner and operator, stated that the blackouts were caused by a 
sudden increase in electricity demand for air conditioning during a strong heat wave and 
a simultaneous explosion at the Mingachevir thermal power plant’s substation in northwestern Azerbaijan.
However, a government investigation found rather different causes. At the plant level, they 
included the continued use of outdated equipment and a disregard for technical and 
security norms. Within the electricity system, capacity to compensate for power disruptions 
was insufficient, and the responsible organisations had been focusing mainly on individual 
initiatives rather than on implementing the country’s strategic development plan.
The blackouts revealed major areas for improvement at several levels. The think tank 
Center for Economic and Social Development (CESD) recommended that the technical 
functioning of the country’s power plants and electricity system be improved, that its 
electricity supply be diversified and that its electricity generation and network systems be 
better integrated. Furthermore, Azerbaijan’s economy and state-owned enterprises need 
to prepare for electricity risks and the entities responsible for maintaining electricity security 
(such as Azerenergy) need to be better organised and co-ordinated.
CESD also pointed out that the state funds allocated to developing and strengthening the 
electricity system had been spent inefficiently and improperly monitored.

http://cesd.az/new/?p=11477. 
Globally, the concept of electricity security is being broadened to also respond to three 
emerging challenges: the clean energy transition, cyber security and climate change. 
Technology developments and climate change mitigation efforts are spurring an electricity 
supply transition from centralised, vertically integrated systems of relatively few large, 
dispatchable thermal power plants to more diversified capacity types and sizes that include 
variable solar and wind power in particular. While cyber security concerns are linked with 
the increasing digitalisation of electricity supply systems, the need for demand-side 
measures is also rising as connected devices, electric vehicles and behind-the-meter
distributed energy resources become more prevalent. Finally, mounting evidence indicates 
that electricity system infrastructure needs to be better adapted to climate change impacts 
such as heat waves and droughts, and the associated reductions in water availability (IEA, 
2020b). These emerging electricity security concerns are likely to become increasingly 
relevant for Azerbaijan.

increase demand. To maximise the benefits of electricity for the population, investments 
are required in new and more efficient generating capacity and electricity grids. The 
country needs a more dynamic electricity sector and could model transformation on 
international best practices that demonstrate how to develop competitive electricity 
wholesale and retail markets. The IEA welcomes the government’s determination to reform 
the electricity system by gradually transitioning from a state-dominated vertically integrated 
system to a more dynamic, efficient and environmentally sustainable one. The challenge 
now is to deliver this metamorphosis.
Market reform
The need for electricity reform was recognised in the 2016 Strategic Roadmap, and several 
proposals have been drafted, including the draft laws on electricity; on the role of the 
regulator in energy and public utilities; and on the use of renewable energy in electricity 
generation. 
The IEA urges the government to adopt the pending legislation and to implement ambitious 
electricity market reforms for the benefit of the country and its economy. International 
experience suggests that reform approaches should be shaped by a country’s specific 
political and economic context, be tailored to achieve desired policy outcomes, and offer 
multiple institutional pathways to achieve the desired outcomes (see Box 4.2). 
The government should first focus on governance issues and financial viability. Tariffs and 
subsidies should be revised to enable full cost recovery, and to encourage investment in 
power sector development and RD&D. Reforms of this kind should help reduce operating 
costs and improve generation, transmission and distribution efficiency. 
Specific policy objectives should also be set for a secure, efficient and clean electricity 
system. Although Azerbaijan has enough gas resources to generate all the electricity it 
needs for decades to come, it is also in the enviable position of having excellent solar and 
wind power potential. Technology costs for solar and wind have declined dramatically, 
making it more inviting for the country to tap into their potential and save more natural gas 
for exports and for petrochemical production, for example. To enable the energy sector to 
allocate resources more efficiently, the IEA urges the government to also reform and 
gradually abolish subsidies for natural gas in electricity generation. 
At the same time, diversifying electricity generation to include more renewable energy 
would help limit CO2 emissions, in line with Azerbaijan’s commitment under the Paris 
Agreement. In this context, the IEA welcomes the government’s plans to raise the share 
of renewable energy in total generating capacity from 16% in 2018 to 30% 2030. 
 All rights reserved.ENERGY SEC
Power sector reforms should be designed according to the enabling conditions of each 
country and oriented primarily towards achieving better sector outcomes. 
 Every power sector reform design needs to be thoroughly grounded in the political 
realities of the specific country to which it pertains. 
 Greater emphasis should be placed on building institutional capacity for power sector 
planning and associated implementation. 
 Generation plants should be procured through a transparent and competitive process, 
with as much contractual flexibility as the context allows. 
 Unbundling should not be the highest priority in countries where more fundamental 
financial and governance challenges persist; it should be undertaken primarily to 
facilitate deeper reforms. 
 Wholesale power markets remain a viable option for countries that have all the 
foundational measures in place; others may derive greater benefit from regional trade.
 Greater efforts should be made to strengthen the corporate governance and 
managerial practices of state-owned utilities. 
 The regulatory framework needs to be adapted to reflect the institutional context and 
accommodate emerging technological trends. 
 Private sector participation in distribution should be considered only when enabling 
conditions are met. 
 Achieving the 21st-century goals of universal access and decarbonisation will require
additional reform measures targeted explicitly at these objectives.
Source: Foster and Rana (2020), Rethinking Power Sector Reform in the Developing World. 
Policies and measures are needed to meet electricity market reform objectives, for 
example to provide for unbundling, third-party access to grids, transparent wholesale 
markets, and partial privatisation of monopolies. If reform is to be successful, it must 
ensure the effective unbundling of Azerenergy’s generating assets from its transmission 
grid ownership and grid operations. It must also provide for non-discriminatory third-party 
access to the transmission and distribution grids. At the same time, transmission and 
distribution tariffs should be separated from energy supply tariffs to enable the use of 
performance-based incentives.
Electricity generation should be opened up to competition, and wholesale and retail 
markets created. This is best done gradually. The first steps should be to remove entry 
barriers for new participants and to transition towards unsubsidised cost-based economic 
dispatch of power plants to increase efficiency. This should be quite feasible, since – 
except for autoproducers – almost all generating capacity is owned by Azerenergy.
To increase competition, the government should consider privatising some of 
Azerenergy’s generating assets. Emphasis should be on privatisation as a potential means 
to increase competition and operational efficiency rather than as an end in itself, and full 
privatisation will probably not be necessary to achieve the desired goals. For example, in 
 All rights reserved.long-term PPAs, a mechanism should be designed to integrate PPAs into the future 
wholesale market (see Chapter 8).
Gains from more efficient generation and grid operations would limit the need to raise enduser prices, and in any case social policy measures could be targeted to vulnerable 
customers. 
A major step in Azerbaijan’s electricity market reform has been the establishment of a 
regulator. As AERA remains closely overseen by the MoE, just like the electricity sector 
monopolies Azerenergy and Azerishiq, it will be essential to grant it the legal right to take 
binding decisions and issue recommendations. 
Efficiency would be further increased by differentiating consumer tariffs by time of use to
encourage electricity consumption when it is less expensive, and thus help businesses 
increase their competitiveness. Time-of-use tariffs are standard practice in many 
countries, as they provide an incentive for demand-response applications, smooth the 
daily load curve, decrease peak loads and reduce the need for additional capacity. 
Dynamic end-user pricing could also encourage utilities to innovate, for example in terms 
of demand-response measures. 
Electricity security
Having an uninterrupted supply of electricity is critical for a modern society. In their efforts 
to ensure electricity security, many IEA member countries have found it useful to put a 
comprehensive framework in place, supported by laws, regulations, policies and measures 
that address generation, transmission, distribution and supply challenges. The IEA urges 
Azerbaijan to consider a similar framework approach.
An electricity security framework should include clear targets covering fuel security, 
resource adequacy, operational security and governance. It should also include indicators 
to measure progress. Azerbaijan’s fuel/energy source security appears sound, as the 
country has significant natural gas resources and is set to diversify into solar and wind 
power generation. The country is also relatively well placed to deal with resource 
adequacy, and it is building more power plants and cross-border connections to 
supplement its generating capacity, which already is twice as high as peak demand. 
Furthermore, efforts to modernise Azerbaijan’s networks are under way to keep up with 
growing demands. 
Operational security challenges are more of a concern. While the gas-fired power plants 
that dominate generation are relatively new and flexible, the 2018 blackouts demonstrated 
that improvements are needed in several areas: system operations, emergency protocols, 
resilience, co-ordination and communications, and situational awareness. Another key 
area to strengthen is governance, including legislation, institutions and regulation. 
 All rights reserved.ENERGY SEC
incentives and rules. 
2. Identify risks: undertake regular systemwide risk analyses. 
3. Manage and mitigate risk: improve preparedness across the electricity supply chain. 
4. Monitor progress: track, record and share experiences. 
5. Respond and recover: cope with outages or attacks and benefit from the lessons 
learned. 
Energy policy makers should raise awareness of these three risk areas and engage with 
all government agencies as well as stakeholders to improve understanding and decide 
how to avoid and deal with complications. 
To help prevent electricity security emergencies, the government should carry out 
emergency response exercises, as they have proven effective in boosting preparedness 
and response capability in other countries. In addition, the government could devise 
probabilistic simulations to assess how various system elements contribute to operational 
security related to solar and wind generation variability, generator and transmission line 
outages, cross-border connection availability, system reserve margins, load variability and 
demand response.
Efficient system operations 
A decade of electricity sector changes lies ahead for Azerbaijan as it implements market 
reforms and takes action to roughly double the share of renewable electricity in total 
generating capacity by 2030. While the government should assess electricity infrastructure 
requirements and prepare long-term network development plans, it also needs to ensure 
that it has enough people with the expertise necessary to accomplish this transformation. 
Of increasing concern is the grid integration of variable solar and wind power, which will 
require greater electricity system flexibility. While gas-fired capacity will continue to provide 
flexibility, the government should also prepare a general plan for ancillary services, 
including storage and demand response. An ancillary services market should be 
developed to allow energy-intensive enterprises (such as aluminium and steel 
manufacturing) to participate in a demand-response system. 
As cross-border trade can also be a source of flexibility and improved economic efficiency, 
the IEA is glad to note that Azerbaijan has strengthened its cross-border connections. The 
country intends to significantly increase its electricity exports in the coming years, while 
trade with hydropower-rich Georgia would allow seasonal imports of hydropower 
generation. 
Azerbaijan is modernising its transmission and distribution infrastructure and has 
succeeded in reducing network losses in recent years. Modernising network infrastructure 
offers the opportunity to upgrade it and make it smarter: installing smart meters, digital 
substations and sensor control and operational systems would help raise efficiency. It 
would also accommodate higher shares of solar and wind power and prompt the adoption 
of cyber-security protection measures. Furthermore, it would encourage the use of 
 All rights reserved.wind power, and would also help ensure equipment quality and standardisation. The IEA
therefore urges the Azerbaijani authorities to adopt the network code that has been drafted 
as soon as possible.
Recommendations
The government of Azerbaijan should:
 Support effective unbundling and develop competitive electricity wholesale and retail 
markets, overseen by an independent regulatory body with clear duties and 
appropriate powers, to enable third-party access to the grid on non-discriminatory 
terms and to help attract private sector investment.
 Consider the case for privatising elements of the country’s generating capacity and 
developing public-private partnerships to promote competition and operational 
efficiency.
 Develop a transparent electricity tariff-setting methodology that will incentivise 
investment in efficient power sector development and RD&D.
 Differentiate tariffs according to voltage level and time of use.
 Develop and introduce a framework for short- and long-term generation, transmission, 
distribution and supply security, supported by targets and indicators to measure 
progress.
 Task the regulator and the TSO with preparing a long-term network development plan, 
monitoring its implementation and updating it regularly.
 Prepare a plan to develop ancillary services, including storage and demand-side 
response, to maintain network stability and security.
 Expedite the adoption of a network code for the electricity system, including rules and 
standards for variable renewable energy integration.

Consumption: 0.32 Mtoe (industry 54.3%, residential 38.3%, services/other 7.4%), +133%

Overview
Azerbaijan uses natural gas for around 99% of its space heating. In the decades since the 
collapse of the Soviet Union, the government has focused on expanding the natural gas 
grid to the whole population, and district heating (DH) has become less important.
Detailed data on the market shares of individual heating technologies in Azerbaijan are 
not available, but individual gas boilers cover at least 80% of heating needs, owing to 
generous subsidies for small-scale gas use. However, DH continues to be important in 
some sectors: in 2017, it provided heating services to 26% of hospitals; 9% of preschools; 
6% of schools; and 2.6% of residential buildings (ECS, 2020). Moreover, there is scope 
for it to figure more significantly in Azerbaijan’s future energy system. Combined with 
electricity and cooling generation and heat pump and waste heat use, modern DH 
technology has the potential to provide economically and environmentally attractive clean 
energy.
Supply and demand 
Practically all Azerbaijan’s district heat is generated from natural gas (Figure 5.1). In 2019, 
district heat consumption amounted to 0.32 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) (133% 
more than in 2008) (Figure 5.2), or 3% of the country’s total final consumption (TFC). 
Residential district heat use grew more than fourfold from 2008 to 2019, while consumption 
in the energy industry declined to almost zero. The share of heat generated by 
co-generation1 plants therefore decreased from 64% in 2008 to 9% in 2017 (ECS, 2020). 
Reversing the declining trend of the past decade, the use of DH for process heat in the 
chemicals/petrochemicals sector started in 2018.

in which the end-user heat price (tariff) is set directly or indirectly by the government. DH 
companies are subsidised to compensate for losses from heat tariffs that do not fully cover 
generation and distribution costs. In contrast, Sweden and Finland have unregulated DH 
markets, in which DH has to compete with other heat sources such as direct electric 
heating or heat pumps (IEA, 2019). 
In some cases, a regulator is responsible for price-setting, often in conformity with a model 
of some kind. These situations tend to fit somewhere between strict government regulation 
and free market pricing systems. Prices can be regulated according to a cost-plus model, 
which allows the heat supplier to cover its costs and obtain a reasonable return on its 
investments (this is what happens in the Slovak Republic, for example). Another model for 
price regulation puts a cap on the DH price and allows for any price models below that 
cap. The price cap can be based on best practice through a market benchmark, as in 
Denmark, or defined by an alternative heating technology, as in Norway and the 
Netherlands (IEA, 2019; 2018).
In Azerbaijan, district heat prices are regulated by the Tariff Council and approved by the 
government. Current tariffs, which have been in force since December 2011 and were 
reconfirmed in January 2017, apply to all DH systems in the country. For residential use, 
the tariff is AZN 0.15 per m2 of living area per month, and for non-residential use it is AZN 
0.25 per m3 of heated space per month. For the relatively few consumers with a heat meter, 
the tariff is AZN 30 per gigacalorie (Gcal). Tariffs for hot water used to be set by the Tariff 
Council, but since January 2017 they have been determined by Azeristiliktejhizat, which 
increased the tariffs (per m3) for households from AZN 0.4 to AZN 1.92 and for nonhouseholds from AZN 1.5 to AZN 3.1 (ECS, 2020). 
Importantly, natural gas tariffs in Azerbaijan differ across consumer groups, which puts DH 
at a competitive disadvantage with other heating technologies. In 2019, gas prices per 
1 000 m3 were AZN 100 for small consumers (individual gas boiler users) and AZN 120 
for electricity generators, but AZN 200 for district heat generators (see Chapter 3).
Azeristiliktechizat does not publish its financial reports, but it is obvious that current tariffs 
do not enable the company to make a profit, let alone generate sufficient revenue for the 
investments needed to rehabilitate and modernise the DH system. According to the Law 
on the State Budget, the company has consistently received state aid. In 2011-2012, the 
aid was allocated as increases in fixed capital (USD 51 million in total), and in 2013 as a 
subsidy (USD 27 million). Since 2014, state aid to Azeristiliktechizat has been categorised 
as financial assistance (totalling USD 110 million from 2014 to 2019, or USD 18.4 million 
per year) (ECS, 2020). 
The current tariff methodology does not oblige or encourage Azeristiliktechizat to reduce 
its operational costs or to improve the efficiency of heat generation or distribution. In fact, 
international experience shows that this kind of tariff methodology may instead prompt
utilities to increase their costs to justify a greater need for regulated revenue.

through integrated district heating, cooling and electricity systems, but finding the financing 
necessary for investments is difficult because of below-cost district heat tariffs and 
subsidies for natural gas heating.
Azerbaijan does not have an official strategy for the DH sector, or for the heating sector in 
general. Since 2005 (subsequent to a 2004 USAID technical assistance project),
Azeristiliktechizat has focused on abandoning large, Soviet-era centralised systems and 
establishing smaller boilers in individual urban areas. These smaller boilers typically supply 
heat to 10-15 blocks of flats and are relatively highly automated. 
Distribution losses were relatively stable from 2010 to 2017 at 11-13% of heat generated, 
and decreased to 7% in 2018 (SSC, 2019). However, a lack of heat meters means that 
these figures are indicative only, calculated according to a formula. 
Modernising existing DH systems would reduce thermal losses and water leakage and 
decrease maintenance and repair costs. Integrating heating, cooling and electricity would 
also help optimise energy supply more generally. 
Heating and electricity systems can be integrated in several ways, for example through 
co-generation or by using heat pumps to generate district heat. From a given electricity 
input, heat pumps can produce roughly three to four times more energy in the form of heat, 
depending on the outdoor temperature and the technology used. They are thus an 
attractive heating option with no local emissions of their own. DH systems typically use 
large heat pumps.
DH systems can also be used to generate cooling in absorption/adsorption chillers 
(refrigerators that use heat instead of electricity to drive the cooling process). With heat 
pumps, DH and district cooling (DC) can be generated in an efficient and integrated 
process. Combining DH and DC in an integrated district energy network can deliver 
efficiency gains of 30-50%. District energy is best suited to densely populated areas that 
can exploit waste heat and provide flexibility to the electricity grid through thermal inertia 
(IEA, 2020). DH and DC can also be generated together with electricity through 
trigeneration, as is done, for example, in the district heating and cooling (DHC) systems of
Stockholm and Helsinki.
In Azerbaijan, DHC could be used in the Baku area, for example, to supply large residential 
buildings, industries, offices, commercial buildings such as shopping malls, and public 
services such as hospitals.
As heat can also be stored more easily than electricity, thermal storage could be used to 
facilitate system balancing as more power is generated from variable wind and solar 
resources (an emerging sector in Azerbaijan). In an open electricity market, a DH supplier 
can also respond to price and demand signals by using co-generation, heat pumps and 
thermal storage. For example, in times of high electricity demand, it can adjust DH 
generation to maximise power production and use thermal storage to cover heat demand, 
while in periods of excess power, it can mobilise more heat pumps to generate heat.

the network. Lower temperatures also enable the use of more waste heat, not only from 
industry but also from supermarkets and data centres, as well as heat from renewable 
sources such as geothermal energy and solar irradiation. 
Assessment 
Although Azerbaijan’s government has successfully restored the DH system that was 
practically dismantled in the 1990s, for several reasons the system remains economically 
unviable. Natural gas subsidies favour individual gas boilers over other heating 
technologies, while the state-owned DH monopoly Azeristiliktechizat needs to find 
revenues to modernise its ageing and inefficient Soviet-legacy infrastructure. 
Nevertheless, the current lack of economic viability does not mean that DH has little or no 
future. Modern DH technology, combined with electricity and cooling generation and heat 
pump and waste heat use, has been proven an economically and environmentally 
attractive way to supply energy in many IEA member countries, and could be in Azerbaijan 
also if certain energy market reforms are carried out.
Gas price subsidies for residential consumers remain a major barrier to DH development. 
The household price for gas is only half what Azeristiliktechizat must pay for gas to
generate district heat. As a result, individual gas boilers are by far the most popular space 
heating technology in the country. Many apartments in multi-apartment buildings have 
voluntarily been disconnected from the DH network and opted for individual natural gas or 
electric boilers instead. This compounds the challenge for DH systems, because the 
disconnection of customers from the system leads to overcapacity, which in turn increases 
the average cost of heat supply for final consumers. 
At the same time, the consumer tariff for district heat does not appear to reflect actual 
supply costs and is too low for Azeristiliktechizat to generate the revenues needed to 
modernise the Soviet-era infrastructure. Thus, Azeristiliktechizat is subsidised from the 
state budget to cover its losses (around USD 60 million from 2016 to 2019). Furthermore, 
district heat prices remain the same throughout the year and for all the country’s DH 
systems, and nominal prices have not been changed since 2011. 
The government should therefore introduce cost-reflective consumption-based energy 
tariffs that would enable Azeristiliktechizat to fully recover its costs and compete on equal 
terms in the heat market. Until such tariffs are introduced, the viability of DH infrastructure
could be maintained by avoiding any further erosion of the DH customer base: the best 
way to do this would be to ensure that the cost of natural gas for DH does not exceed the 
price for residential consumers.
A more diversified and dynamic pricing approach that recognises differences in heat loads 
and generating costs would also help save energy and encourage the development of new 
business models. Examples of numerous other countries employing this type of approach 
may provide useful models for Azerbaijan’s government. 
 All rights reserved.also help reduce CO2 emissions. 
Establishing a more efficient integrated energy system would also allow the country to 
save more natural gas for export. An upgraded system could be built gradually and should 
be more economically viable than the current one, which is based on subsidised natural 
gas and therefore ensures complete dominance of individual natural gas boilers, the 
continuous need for DH subsidies, and the loss of potential gas export revenues. 
To identify heating sector opportunities, the government should develop a heat map that 
includes existing DH capacities and waste heat from industry and power generation. It
could then assess strategic investments in DH infrastructure modernisation based on this 
heat map, and direct public and private investment funds towards these areas. The 
government should also evaluate cogeneration and trigeneration potential, and introduce 
incentives or obligations to support them.
It will also be critical to co-ordinate policies on DH, cooling, natural gas and energy 
efficiency. For example, incentives would be needed for a DH system with overcapacity to 
improve the energy efficiency of its operations and promote efficiency for end users. While 
lower heat demand in a DH system could be compensated for by additional new customers 
as more people move into urban areas, this would require the establishment of undistorted 
competition among heating options (i.e. the abolishment of price subsidies for individual 
gas users). Regulation should encourage heat supply innovation and integration with 
smart and energy-efficient buildings, and incentives should be introduced to reward 
gradually more efficient generation. The government should also set efficiency 
improvement targets for Azeristiliktechizat: additional options to boost the company’s 
operational efficiency include restructuring and full or partial privatisation. 
An obvious way to increase efficiency is through metering, which is currently absent 
throughout the DH chain. Although the 1998 Law on Energy stipulates that all energy 
supplied must also be metered, in reality DH network losses are calculated through a 
formula that covers only living space, not the full dwelling area. The installation of meters 
and implementation of consumption-based billing would therefore enable 
Azeristiliktechizat to track actual network losses, while consumers would receive 
transparent information on what they are being billed for. Replacing boilers and pipes, and 
installing energy controls such as individual heating substations and temperatureregulating valves, would also increase efficiency. To encourage further improvements, the 
government should also facilitate the establishment of energy service companies.

effectiveness, competition, efficiency and flexibility, including through sector 
integration, and encourages investment for these purposes. Achieving these ends 
would involve:

which would enable Azeristiliktechizat to fully recover its costs and compete on

Overview
Azerbaijan joined the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC) in 1995 and ratified the Kyoto Protocol in 2000. As a Non-Annex 1 Party to the 
Convention, it did not have to set a target for its GHG emissions, but it has nevertheless 
committed to reduce them. Its main measures in the energy sector have been switching 
from oil to natural gas, increasing power and heat generation efficiency, and limiting 
methane leaks from oil and gas production. In October 2016, Azerbaijan ratified the Paris 
Agreement and pledged to reduce its net GHG emissions to 35% below the 1990 level by
2030. 
In 2018, Azerbaijan’s net GHG emissions, which include a net sink of 7.2 million tonnes of 
carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2-eq) from LULUCF, totalled 46.4 MtCO2-eq, or 2.5% 
more than the 2030 target level.
Broken down by GHG, CO2 accounted for 61.0% of total emissions in 2018, CH4 for 31.5%, 
N2O for 6.5% and F-gases for 0.9%. The relatively high share of CH4 is linked to the 
country’s significant oil and gas production.
 All rights reserved.Azerbaijan’s total GHG emissions have risen less than 10% since 2005.

CO2 emissions from fuel combustion 
In 2019, Azerbaijan’s CO2 emissions from fuel combustion were 34.1 Mt (+18% from 2008) 
(Figure 6.2). Power and heat generation, which relies on natural gas for more than 90% of 
its primary energy, accounted for 36% of the total. The remaining emissions came from 
transport (24%), the residential sector (19%), the energy industry, mainly oil and gas 
production and oil refining (5%), the commercial sector (8%) and the manufacturing 
industry (7%).

raised them by over three-quarters (77%) from 2018 to 2019. The commercial sector’s
emissions developed in a similar manner, dropping by half between 2000 and 2018 (-48%) 
and more than doubling from 2018 to 2019 (148%). Related energy use trends in these 
sectors are analysed elsewhere in this report (see Chapters 3, 4 and 7).
Azerbaijan’s CO2 emissions are driven by a set of factors that include population changes 
and the structure and size of its economy. These, together with the technologies deployed, 
determine the economy’s energy intensity.
Because Azerbaijan’s economy relies heavily on oil and gas exports, the country’s CO2
emissions are not strongly linked to its GDP (Figure 6.3). Rather, emissions correlate more 
strongly with electricity generation, which is based on natural gas and is the highestemitting sector. Growing electricity consumption is in turn linked with population increases
(+25% since 2000) and economic activity outside the oil and gas sector.

Azerbaijan’s CO2 intensity of GDP, at 0.24 kilogrammes of carbon dioxide (kgCO2)/USD 
(2015 PPP) in 2019, is below the world average (Figure 6.4). This reflects the structure of 
its economy as well as its lack of reliance on coal in electricity generation: over the past 
two decades, the country’s power plants have been modernised and fuel oil has been 
replaced by natural gas as the main energy source.

In 2018, Azerbaijan’s power generation sector emitted an average of 430 grammes of CO2
per kilowatt hour (gCO2/kWh) of electricity (Figure 6.6). The relatively high carbon intensity 
reflects the high share (92%) of natural gas in power generation. In the short term, this 
could be reduced by increasing both the efficiency of gas-fired power generation and the 
use of renewable energy, and by introducing incentives to this end as part of electricity 
market reform (see Chapter 4). In the longer term, carbon capture and storage (CCS) 
could also be a viable option for Azerbaijan.

Institutions
The Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources (MENR) is responsible for formulating 
environmental and climate policy, and its Climate Change and Ozone Center co-ordinates 
the National GHG Inventory. The Center has four departments dedicated to: the GHG 
inventory; Climate Change Impact Assessment; Adaptation; and Climate and Ozone. GHG 
data is published in the annual Environment in Azerbaijan report prepared by the State 
Statistical Committee (SSC). 
The National Coordination Council on Sustainable Development, set up in 2016 and 
headed by the deputy prime minister, brings together representatives from various 
ministries to ensure that the country’s socio-economic programmes and strategies 
conform to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The Council includes a separate 
working group for environmental issues, including climate change. 
Policy 
Azerbaijan’s January 2017 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the Paris 
Agreement under the UNFCCC lays out the country’s climate policy objectives and 
planned mitigation policies and measures. The NDC defined the country’s first-ever 
quantitative target for GHG emissions: a 35% reduction from the 1990 level by 2030.
1 
Prior to submitting its NDC, as a Non-Annex 1 Party to the UNFCCC, Azerbaijan did not 
have an emissions target, and climate policy received rather limited attention in
government policy documents. The Azerbaijan 2020 vision from 2012 did, however, 
include a target to decrease energy and CO2 intensities to the OECD average, and the 
2016 strategic roadmaps covering heavy industry and machinery, utilities, and 
manufacturing and processing agricultural products listed several measures to address 
 
1 In absolute terms, the 35% reduction equates to a drop of 25.7 MtCO2-eq from the 1990 level excluding LULUCF
(73.3 MtCO2-eq), or 24.4 MtCO2-eq from 1990 level including LULUCF (69.6 MtCO2-eq).

climate strategy, although MENR, together with the UN Development Programme (UNDP), 
is now preparing a national action plan to meet the NDC targets. MENR has also begun to 
formulate a national strategy for low-carbon development and has established related 
working groups that bring together representatives of various ministries and state 
agencies. 
The 2017 NDC
Azerbaijan’s 2017 NDC outlines climate change mitigation actions for the electricity and 
heat, oil and gas, residential and commercial, transport, agricultural, and waste sectors, 
as well as for LULUCF. They focus on technological improvements, but also include 
regulatory changes and public awareness measures (see Box 6.1). The NDC document 
also explicitly mentions that declining global oil prices will constrain the country’s ability to 
meet its pledge.
A key part of the Paris Agreement is establishing a common system for the transparency of 
climate change mitigation. Measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) is central to 
effective NDC implementation. Measurement is needed to identify emissions trends and 
determine where to focus emissions reduction efforts and to monitor progress. Reporting 
and verification are important for ensuring transparency, good governance, accountability, 
and the credibility of results. Sound MRV is also a precondition for introducing carbon pricing. 
Azerbaijan has plans for an MRV system that would apply to around 70 emitting facilities 
However, the government recognises that building an MRV system will require greater 
institutional capacity within the government – which means personnel must be trained to 
calculate emissions projections and verify emissions – as well as increased know-how 
within companies. 
It is for these reasons that Azerbaijan has not yet introduced a national MRV system. 
Instead, the emitting companies have been measuring and reporting emissions 
themselves, and the environmental administration under MENR has been analysing the 
reports and verifying them through company inspections. However, according to 
Azerbaijan’s 2018 Second Biennial Update Report to the UNFCCC, the government 
suspended all company inspections, including environmental ones, from 2015 to 2021 to 
stimulate entrepreneurship (MENR, 2018).

Limiting GHG emissions from oil and gas production
The outlook for oil and gas exports in a decarbonising world is of critical strategic 
importance for Azerbaijan. Oil and gas continue to provide around 90% of the country’s 
export revenue, and completion of the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline in late 2020 means that gas 
exports to the European Union are set to increase significantly. However, many importing 
countries are aiming to move away from oil and gas use in the medium to long term. The 
European Union especially is striving to make its economy carbon-neutral by 2050.
As 15% of global energy-related GHG emissions come from the process of getting oil and

 All rights reserved.The State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) is part of the Zero Routine 
Flaring by 2030 initiative launched by the World Bank and the UN in 2015. From 2011 to 
2017, SOCAR reduced annual gas flaring from its operations by more than 600 million 
cubic metres (mcm) and is targeting to eliminate flaring completely in 2021. The company 
is also working to reduce methane emissions to 95 mcm per year by 2022 under the plan 
"Reduction of associated gas emissions in SOCAR and projects involving SOCAR for 
2017-2022". In addition, it is planning to adopt in 2021 a low-emission development 
strategy to 2030. (MGP, 2021; SOCAR, 2020a). 
To make oil and gas production more compatible with emissions reductions, facilities could 
be equipped with carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), and the captured CO2
used more extensively in petrochemical production or converted to zero-carbon fuels (e.g.
hydrogen). CCUS equipment could also help mitigate CO2 emissions from gas processing 
and oil refining and aid enhance oil recovery (IEA, 2020a; 2020b). 
To combat climate change and the pollution that threatens the environmental sustainability 
of the Caspian Sea and Absheron Peninsula, in May 2020 SOCAR initiated the Caspian 
Environmental Protection Initiative (CEPI). Global oil and gas companies operating in 
Azerbaijan (BP AGT, Equinor Absheron AS and Total E&P Absheron B.V.) have also 
joined the CEPI. The initiative brings these companies together to share knowledge and 
experience, conduct joint research and implement environmental activities in a 
co-ordinated manner (SOCAR, 2020b). 
Climate change adaptation
The government is preparing a national climate change adaptation plan focused on the 
three priority areas of water, agriculture and coastal areas. This work, led by MENR and 
involving representatives of the relevant ministries and state agencies, builds on 
adaptation measures for agriculture, water supply, forestry, coastal communities, human 
health and tourism already identified in Azerbaijan’s Third National Communication to the 
UNFCCC from 2015.
For the energy sector, the main concerns are linked to water availability, both to supply 
cooling water to thermal power plants – which generated 92.5% of Azerbaijan’s electricity 
in 2019 – and for hydropower, which generated 6.0%. Some of the key climate change 
impacts on the country are expected to result from reduced water availability as winter 
precipitation and snow-melt water decrease, surface and groundwater resources diminish, 
summertime precipitation declines and drought periods become longer/more frequent
(Arent, 2018).

 Higher temperatures reduce the viscosity of transported fuels.
 Higher temperatures increase cooling demand (mostly affecting electricity) and reduce 
heating demand (involving heating fuels and electricity).
 Extreme events (e.g. flooding, landslides) and erosion can damage electricity networks as 
well as oil and gas pipelines.
Local air pollution
Transport is by far the largest source of air pollution in Azerbaijan. According to the SSC, 
it accounted for 85% of the country’s total air pollutant volume in 2018, up from 47% in 
2005 and 78% in 2010. During this period (2005-2018), total national air pollutant 
emissions remained broadly flat (SSC, 2019).
As transport was responsible for more than three-fifths of the country’s total oil
consumption in 2018, better fuel quality is the key to limit air pollution from this sector. 
Azerbaijan follows EU vehicle emission standards, and since April 2014 it has been 
applying the Euro 4 standard, which sets emission limits for several pollutants, including 
NOx and PM. Ongoing modernisation of the Heydar Aliyev Oil Refinery, which supplies 
almost all the country’s transport fuel, will enable it to produce high-quality diesel and 
gasoline that meet the Euro 5 standard (see Chapter 3). Although electric vehicles offer 
significant potential to reduce local air pollution, their numbers remain low in Azerbaijan.
In contrast with transport, air pollution from stationary sources has fallen in the past 15 
years, thanks to a switch from oil- to gas-fired power generation and to modern 
technologies in oil and gas production. Emissions could be reduced further by increasing 
efficiency, saving energy and using alternative energy sources.
Assessment 
Under the Paris Agreement, Azerbaijan’s NDC goal is to reduce net GHG emissions 35% 
from 1990 to 2030. In 2018, its emissions (including LULUCF) stood at 46.4 MtCO2-eq – 
33.4% below the 1990 level and 2.5% higher than the 2030 target. According to the most 
recent IEA data, in 2019 Azerbaijan’s CO2 emissions from fuel combustion amounted to 
34.1 MtCO₂ (+17.3% since 2005, -36.3% since 1990). Attaining the 2030 NDC target will 
be complicated if the country does not tackle the rise in transport fuel demand 
(unrestrained by prices or taxes) and expanding natural gas consumption (subsidised in 
all sectors). 
Since Azerbaijan currently does not have legally binding climate targets or measures, the 
government should consider introducing them, for example as part of revising the Law on 
Energy. The government has, however, outlined climate change mitigation actions for the 
power and heat, oil and gas, residential and commercial, transport, agriculture and waste 
sectors. These measures primarily entail technological improvements to reduce negative 
 All rights reserved.instituting fuel efficiency requirements would help reduce air pollution and CO2 emissions, 
as would using the country’s valuable fossil fuel resources more efficiently and increasing 
the use of its considerable untapped renewable energy resources in power generation. 
Fossil fuel subsidy reforms and revenue-neutral carbon pricing could achieve these ends, 
making more oil and gas available for export.
There is also a strong case for developing policies and strategies beyond 2030. As more 
buildings will be constructed, more appliances and equipment sold, and more vehicles 
bought in upcoming decades, strong energy efficiency policies will be increasingly
relevant, and the country will need a long-term approach to keep it on an environmentally 
sustainable pathway. With its population set to continue to grow, urbanise and become 
wealthier, Azerbaijan will need to build more urban infrastructure: energy and climate 
concerns should be an integral part of long-term transport and urban development policies 
to avoid the lock-in of private car-dominated, inefficient and energy-intensive urban 
structures. For instance, if private car ownership in Azerbaijan were to increase to the 
current EU average, it would explode almost fourfold to 5 million (see Chapter 7). 
The long-term decarbonisation objectives of the European Union and many other countries 
challenge Azerbaijan’s reliance on oil and gas for export revenue. Further measures are 
therefore needed both to reduce the CO2 intensity of oil and gas production and to diversify 
the country’s economy.
Climate change could affect Azerbaijan’s energy supply in several ways. Abnormal heat 
could necessitate power plant capacity reductions as well as reduce the availability of 
water for cooling thermal power plants and for generating hydropower. While higher
temperatures and stronger winds could complicate electricity transmission and distribution, 
higher temperatures would also likely reduce energy demand in the winter and raise
consumption in the summer. 
Encouragingly, MENR is preparing a National Strategy for Low-Carbon Development and 
a Climate Change Adaptation Plan, and working groups made up of representatives from
all the relevant ministries and state agencies have been established. To make
policymaking more effective, a system to measure, report and verify emissions should be 
introduced, modelling capacity should be increased and co-ordination among the relevant 
government ministries and other entities strengthened.

Overview
Population growth and economic development are major drivers of energy demand. From 
2000 to 2019, Azerbaijan’s GDP increased more than fourfold, largely owing to higher oil 
and gas exports since the mid-2000s. Its population expanded by almost one-quarter, and 
total final consumption (TFC) of energy by almost two-thirds (Figure 7.1).
Azerbaijan’s use of energy increased 65% between 2000 and 2019 to reach 10.8 million 
tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe). Most (over 60%) of this growth resulted from oil use in the 
transport sector more than tripling. The country’s main energy sources in 2019 were oil 
(42%), natural gas (40%) and electricity (15%).
Since 2008, transport has shown the strongest absolute growth (+70%), whereas 
consumption in the residential sector (still the largest end consumer) increased only 1%. 
Industry consumption was essentially flat for a decade, but it jumped almost 30% from 
2018 to 2019 due to new economic activity. Commercial consumption has also increased 
rapidly in recent years (+118% since 2008), but from a low base (Figure 7.2).
Globally, while technologies and processes are becoming more efficient, structural factors 
such as changes in transport modes and increasing floor area per person are dampening 
the impact of these technical efficiency gains on energy demand and slowing global energy 
intensity improvements. This poses a challenge for Azerbaijan’s policymakers, as the 
country’s population is projected to continue increasing. Judging from other countries’ 
experiences, the quality of the housing stock will improve as the population becomes 
wealthier. Heating and cooling devices are expected to become more efficient but also 
more numerous, as are other household appliances.

and per unit of output.

Source: IEA (2021), World Energy Balances 2021 (database), www.iea.org/statistics. 
Energy intensity can be measured as TFC per capita, and in 2019 Azerbaijan’s per capita 
TFC was 1.1 tonne of oil equivalent (toe), or 18% below the 2018 world average of 1.3 toe 
(Figure 7.3). Energy intensity is often also measured as TFC per GDP. In 2019, 
Azerbaijan’s energy intensity per unit of GDP at PPP was 74 toe per million USD – just 
below the 2018 world average of 77 toe per million USD. However, the high share of oil 
and gas exports in GDP constrain the usefulness of TFC/GDP as an efficiency indicator 
for Azerbaijan (see note under Figure 7.1.).

Trends by sector 
Residential
In 2019, the residential sector was the largest end user of energy, consuming 3.5 Mtoe 
and accounting for 32% of TFC. The sector’s TFC has remained stable (+1% since 2008), 
but its TFC structure has continued to change, as natural gas use for space heating has 
increased at the expense of electricity (Figure 7.4). Today the gas grid reaches 96% of 
Azerbaijan’s population thanks to the government’s grid expansion policy.
Natural gas therefore made up 80% of residential TFC in 2019, up from 75% in 2008. 
Electricity provided 15%, down from 19% in 2008, while district heat accounted for 3% of 
residential TFC. District heat in Azerbaijan is generated from natural gas and its use in the 
residential sector more than quadrupled from 2008 (a rise of 314%), but subsidies are 
significantly higher for gas used in residential natural gas boilers than by district heat 
generators (see Chapter 5).
Residential heating is dominated by individual natural gas boilers. According to the SSC, 
20% of all dwellings were connected to a centrally driven heating system in 2019 and 2% 
had hot water delivered through a district heating system. Oil and bioenergy (firewood) 
together accounted for less than 1% of residential TFC: firewood use decreased 83% from 
2008 to 2019 and oil by 90% mainly owing to the government’s policy to expand natural 
gas use. Thus, almost four-fifths of dwellings were individually heated in 2018, mostly by 
natural gas boilers but in some cases by electricity.

Although residential sector TFC increased only slightly from 2010 to 2018, by 6.3% 
(196 kilotonnes of oil equivalent [ktoe]), the decomposition of energy consumption reveals 
that without energy efficiency improvements, it would have been 5.1% (169 ktoe) higher 
in 2018. From 2010 to 2018, changes in the sector’s structure raised its TFC by 65 ktoe, 
and increased activity (i.e. floor area expansion) boosted it another 299 ktoe (IEA, 2020c).
Transport
Transport accounts for most of the increase in Azerbaijan’s TFC since 2000 (see Figure 
7.2). In 2019, it was the second-largest consuming sector (26% of TFC) at 2.8 Mtoe, up 
70% from 2008 (Figure 7.5). The sector consumes oil for almost all its energy needs (99% 
in 2019). Electricity made up around 1% of consumption in 2019 (down 31% from 2008), 
while natural gas use remains marginal.
Vehicle ownership and transport volumes have expanded quickly in the past decade. From 
2005 to 2018, the total number of registered vehicles in Azerbaijan more than doubled 
from 612 000 to 1 371 000 (an increase of 124%) (SSC, 2019a). Also during this period, 
the number of passenger cars increased from 479 000 to 1 171 000 (+144%), while 
passenger cars ownership per thousand inhabitants rose from 56 to 119. The number of 
buses increased by only 4 000, or 15%. In recent years (2015-2018) growth has been 
slow, with the total number of vehicles rising by 3.6%.
Azerbaijan’s vehicle fleet is rather old: in 2018, only 6% of all motor vehicles in the country 
were less than five years old, while 77% were more than 10 years old, up from 50% in 
2010. Lorries and buses were older than the average, implying low fuel efficiency, a greater 
impact on the environment and high operational and maintenance costs compared with 
new vehicles. Around 40% of passenger cars imported into Azerbaijan over the last 
decade were second-hand.
The total volume of public transport roughly doubled (+113%) during 2005-2018, and all 
forms of travel (excluding railways) expanded. Since 2015, however, the increase has 
been only 6%. In 2018, 88% of passenger transport was by road (23.8 billion passengerkm, up from 10.9 billion pkm in 2005), compared with only 1.6% by rail (0.5 billion pkm,

Industry
In 2019, industry consumed 2.8 Mtoe, or 26% of TFC, virtually equal to transport 
consumption (Figure 7.6). Its TFC dropped notably in the aftermath of the 2008 economic 
crisis, bottoming out in 2010 and then rising to surpass the pre-crisis level in 2016. Overall, 
TFC grew only 4% from 2008 to 2018 but jumped almost 30% from 2018 to 2019.

boosted it 315 ktoe (Figure 7.8). 
The most significant energy efficiency improvement was in the chemical subsector 
(151 ktoe), followed by the food industry (73 ktoe) and iron and steel (64 ktoe). At the 
same time, higher energy intensity increased energy consumption in the machinebuilding sector by 28 ktoe.

From 2008 to 2019, TFC in services (both public and commercial) increased by 720 ktoe, 
or 158%, reflecting the country’s overall economic development. In recent years, most of 
the energy consumed has come from electricity (2013-2018 average 66%), but in 2019 
natural gas and electricity were on par. The decomposition of the change in TFC 
(+224 ktoe) reveals that energy intensity accounted for 34 ktoe of the total change, and 
activity increase for 190 ktoe. 
In agriculture, forestry and fishing, TFC grew 64% from 2008 to 509 ktoe in 2019, reflecting 
increased mechanisation of the sector. Agriculture depends on oil for most of its energy 
needs (63%), but also uses electricity (19%) and natural gas (17%). The decomposition of

 All rights reserved.Azerbaijan has yet to adopt specific legislation, strategies, action plans and targets for 
energy efficiency. Many obstacles hinder energy efficiency improvements (see Box 7.1), 
and government institutions for implementing energy efficiency policy also remain to be 
developed. Nevertheless, the situation is expected to improve soon: the government 
recently developed a draft energy efficiency law that is awaiting adoption and is also 
preparing a national energy efficiency action plan (see below).
Existing energy legislation refers to energy efficiency in rather general terms. In the 1996 
Law on the Use of Energy Resources, it is included among the guiding principles for 
governing the use of energy resources. The 1998 Law on Energy, in turn, lists the 
conservation of energy resources and the efficient use of energy among the principal 
energy market policies. In practice, energy efficiency has not been a particular area of 
focus for the government, and legislation passed to date has had very limited impact, partly 
because end-use energy prices have been kept very low and because minimum energy 
performance standards (MEPS) have not been introduced. Efficiency measures 
implemented in recent years have been financed primarily by foreign donors, including the 
European Union and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
In 2012, the government set a target to improve energy efficiency 20% by 2020, but this 
goal was not supported by a strategy or legal framework. The 2016 Strategic Road Map 
for the Development of Utilities was more specific and has produced results. It outlined the 
need for greater efficiency in the gas, electricity and district heat sectors and aimed 
specifically to reduce electricity distribution losses in Baku from 8.5% to 7% by 2020, and 
in the other regions from 12% to 8%. It also aspired to reduce gas distribution losses from 
18.6% to 8% by 2020, and these efforts to reduce losses have been quite successful (see 
Chapters 3 and 4). 
A draft Law on the Efficient Use of Energy Resources and Energy Efficiency is in the 
process of adoption. The draft law was prepared by the Energy Charter Secretariat and 
the Ministry of Energy (MoE) as part of the EU-funded EU4Energy programme and it is 
based on EU and other international best practice. It passed the inter-ministerial 
consultation process in 2018 and was submitted to the Administration of the President in 
May 2019. 
Once adopted, the law will define the legal, organisational and economic basis for energy 
efficiency policies and measures. The draft law covers the entire energy chain: exploration 
and production, transportation, distribution, supply and final use. It also includes a 
requirement to develop a five-year national energy efficiency action plan (NEEAP). The 
MoE started developing the NEEAP with the support of the EU4Energy programme in May 
2019.

Box 7.1 Key barriers to energy efficiency in Azerbaijan
In its 2020 In-Depth Review of the Energy Efficiency Policy of the Republic of Azerbaijan, 
the Energy Charter Secretariat identified several barriers to improving energy efficiency in 
the country (ECS, 2020): 
 The country has no legislative framework or targets for energy efficiency.
 Before 2016, political willingness to implement energy efficiency reforms was lacking.
 Azerbaijan’s energy tariff policy is not sustainable and does not create incentives to implement 
energy efficiency measures and broader strategic targets, such as increasing energy exports. 
 Non-cost-reflective energy tariffs and the lack of a long-term energy tariff policy cause consumers 
to be resistant to tariff increases.
 The MoE’s Energy Efficiency and Ecology Department lacks sufficient human resources to 
introduce energy efficiency policies.
 General awareness and knowledge about the multiple benefits of energy efficiency are low.
Removing barriers such as these have helped governments in other countries save energy 
and money, reduce harmful emissions and create jobs.

Buildings
Specific policies and measures to save energy in buildings have yet to be adopted. For 
example, there are no MEPRs for buildings or building components. Although several 
energy audit training programmes have been carried out in recent years, energy audits are 
still not required. Expertise in the sector is scarce, and awareness of the benefits of energy 
efficiency refurbishments and of renewable energy technologies (e.g. solar thermal 
installations for hot water production) remains low, hindering action. Financing 
programmes to construct energy-efficient buildings do not exist, partly because low 
subsidised energy prices lengthen the payback period, reducing their attractiveness. Low 
subsidised energy prices are also part of the reason that construction companies have 
notactively considered energy efficiency measures, and why consumers are not seeking 
energy-efficient appliances. Fortunately, the pending energy efficiency law is expected to 
fill many of these gaps.
 All rights reserved.half of that energy could be saved. Similarly, the NAMA project3 to retrofit six State Oil 
Company of the Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) buildings indicated a technical energysaving potential of 58% (ECS, 2020).
Transport
Although Azerbaijan does not have specific measures to increase energy efficiency in 
transport, excise taxes on passenger cars and buses favour small engines (Table 7.1). 
However, incentives to purchase vehicles with an engine capacity of less than 2 000 cubic 
centimetres (cm3) are not particularly strong,4 while excise taxes do not consider the age 
of the vehicle or its emissions of air pollutants or CO2. 
Transport costs are high in Azerbaijan, and limited domestic connectivity outside of Baku 
continues to constrain rural residents’ economic prospects. Azerbaijan’s road and rail 
networks need to be modernised, and more money needs to be spent on maintenance so 
that the country can take better advantage of its position on the Caspian Sea and its 
proximity to major markets such as Iran, the Russian Federation and Turkey (OECD, 
2019). Road investments dominate government spending on transport infrastructure, while 
inland waterway transport infrastructure remains of significant but secondary importance. 
Only 0.2% of inland infrastructure spending benefits the country’s rail network (ITF, 2019).

In recent years, public transport availability has been improved by Baku metro and railway 
network expansions, and 300 compressed natural gas (CNG) buses were also added to 
the Baku bus fleet. Repair and electrification of the national railway network have been 
carried out, and locomotives and rolling stock have been modernised. Efforts to increase 
economic efficiency have also improved the environmental performance of Azerbaijan’s 
railways. At the same time, however, railway use has declined in absolute terms (SSC, 
2019a).
According to the World Economic Forum, Azerbaijan ranks 27th of 141 countries in the 
category of "quality of road infrastructure", 34th in the category of "railway density" and 
11th in "efficiency of train services".
Industry
There are currently no estimates of energy efficiency potential, and no targets or incentives 
to reduce energy consumption in industry. At the same time, low energy tariffs continue to 
undermine the economic attractiveness of energy efficiency measures.
However, the government is drafting a national action plan on energy efficiency. The draft 
suggests setting up a database on energy efficiency measures that would delineate their 
potential and benefits, arranged according to industry subsector. It also includes the 
introduction of energy audits, applied energy management systems, and a system for 
periodically reporting the results of efficiency measures.
In the energy industry, several state programmes to install meters have been enacted to 
reduce electricity and gas distribution losses, to increase power plant efficiency and to 
prevent the theft and inefficient use of electricity. They have focused primarily on improving 
utilities’ financial viability. 
Appliances
MEPS and energy labelling have proven highly effective policy tools to improve the 
efficiency of new appliances, and although they are now used in over 80 countries, 
Azerbaijan has yet to introduce them. The country needs to adopt standards for devices 
and products (required for energy labelling) and establish a certification mechanism. It also 
requires more specialists in this field.
The most recent study on Azerbaijan’s energy-saving potential, carried out in 2015 by the 
Center for Energy Efficiency (CENEF) and the Copenhagen Centre on Energy Efficiency 
(C2E2), looked at replacing household appliances and lighting with the most efficient 
options. It concluded that these replacements could reduce household energy 
consumption by 7%. However, Azerbaijan’s relatively low energy prices weaken the 
incentive to replace appliances.
According to SSC statistics on the penetration of household appliances, the country is 
likely to experience particularly rapid growth in dishwashers (available in 7% of households 
 All rights reserved.widespread installation of meters for electricity and gas consumption in recent years. They 
have helped reduce losses and promote more rational energy use.
Assessment 
Like other countries that have legacy infrastructure and subsidised energy prices, there is 
great potential for Azerbaijan to use energy more efficiently. The IEA strongly encourages 
the government to view energy efficiency as a source of revenue, clean air and jobs, and 
to quickly adopt the laws, strategies, policies and measures needed to realise these 
possibilities.
Although Azerbaijan does not yet have specific energy efficiency legislation, the 
government has been committed to developing it in recent years. In 2016, the president 
approved the Strategic Roadmap for Development of Utilities Services (Electric Energy, 
Heating, Water and Gas) and the parliament ratified the Paris Agreement. Furthermore, 
the president is expected to submit the draft Law on the Efficient Use of Energy Resources 
and Energy Efficiency to the parliament soon, and the government is also developing the 
country’s NEEAP.
There is a strong argument for taking rapid action on energy efficiency, building on the 
draft legislation currently being considered and bearing in mind Azerbaijan’s Paris 
Agreement pledge to reduce GHG emissions 35% from 1990 to 2030. Experience in IEA 
member countries has demonstrated that MEPS are among the most effective and costefficient energy efficiency policy instruments. The government should therefore introduce 
stringent standards across all sectors (covering buildings, vehicles, appliances and 
equipment) and should implement an effective energy efficiency audit mechanism to 
ensure compliance. It should also regularly update the standards and, when applicable, 
accompany them with energy labelling.
In addition to regulating through stringent energy efficiency standards, the government 
could do more to encourage investment in energy-efficient equipment. This would require 
changes to the tariff regulation methodology. 
Energy prices must be set at an optimal level to attract investment and to encourage 
citizens to use energy efficiently. However, Azerbaijan’s end-user energy prices, which are 
set by the government, are currently among the lowest in the region and do not reflect the 
full cost of supply (see Chapters 3 and 4). In 2018, the country’s energy price subsidies 
were three times higher than in 2010, totalling USD 2.6 billion or 5.8% of GDP, according 
to IEA estimates. Such subsidised tariffs do not encourage residential and industrial 
consumers to improve their energy efficiency (IEA, 2019b), even though doing so would 
benefit the whole country economically. The oil and gas saved thanks to energy efficiency 
measures could be exported for revenue, or simply used more efficiently elsewhere for the 
good of the national economy.
Instead of subsidising energy for everyone, the government should gradually switch to 
supporting more efficient energy use. For example, it could launch programmes to replace 
 All rights reserved.ENERGY SYSTEM TRANSFORMA
energy efficiency policies and measures. The government should ensure the availability of 
robust and meaningful disaggregated energy efficiency indicators by sector. It should also 
use the data to assess the energy efficiency potential of the buildings, transport and 
industry sectors. 
Another area that merits considerable attention is energy efficiency capacity-building and 
training, which should be co-ordinated both nationally and regionally. Dedicated 
educational programmes should also be launched at both levels. 
Buildings and appliances
The residential and commercial sectors account for around half of Azerbaijan’s TFC. They 
have significant energy efficiency potential, as the energy performance of the existing 
building stock is low and there are no MEPRs for new buildings and appliances. 
Disaggregated data for a more detailed analysis are needed.
The economic benefits of retrofits are likely to be highest when projects focus on the least
efficient buildings and include both building envelope improvements and heating
equipment installation. Raising building efficiency, through retrofits and efficient 
construction that encourage electrification and the installation of smart energy 
management systems, helps improve energy system security and resilience by reducing 
energy use (IEA, 2020a).
In line with the Energy Charter Secretariat’s work to identify the main barriers to energy 
efficiency in Azerbaijan’s buildings, the IEA encourages the government to: 
 Introduce specific targets and MEPRs for energy efficiency in new and existing public and 
residential buildings. 
 Review and update standards for the thermal protection of buildings. 
 Increase awareness of the benefits of energy-efficient buildings among decision makers, 
businesses and the general population. 
 Introduce financial incentives or state support to improve energy efficiency in buildings. 
 Increase awareness of no-cost or low-cost energy efficiency measures in public and 
residential buildings. 
 Introduce incentives for local municipalities and owners of buildings to reduce energy 
consumption. 
Energy codes and standards will be essential to improve the energy performance and 
comfort of Azerbaijan’s buildings. As the long-term benefits for consumers in terms of 
energy-cost savings and health benefits are clear, there is a strong argument for 
introducing financing mechanisms for efficient housing. The government also needs to 
 All rights reserved.where compliance is verified by public sector building inspectors.
Azerbaijan does not have MEPRs, energy labelling or financial incentives for energyefficient appliances. The government should therefore introduce them, starting with 
products that are less technically complex and that may offer the highest energy savings 
for residential consumers, such as heaters, air conditioners, dishwashers, washing 
machines and televisions, in addition to lightbulbs. MEPRs should also be applied to 
appliances used in industry and the service sector.
As low electricity prices typically dampen consumer interest in higher-efficiency 
appliances, tariff reform is needed. Households and services are the foremost electricity 
consuming sectors. Measures to raise the efficiency of electricity use as well as the level 
of electricity security include modernising transmission and distribution systems, 
introducing MEPRs for appliances, deploying energy management systems for buildings, 
and auditing large buildings (government, residential and corporate). 
Transport
TFC in the transport sector, which has more than tripled since 2000, accounted for 26% of 
the country’s TFC in 2019. The number of vehicles has more than doubled since 2005, but 
ownership rates remain relatively low by international standards. In 2018, Azerbaijan had 
119 passenger cars per 1 000 inhabitants, while the EU rate, for example, exceeded 500 
per 1 000 inhabitants. Road transport energy consumption is expected to continue rising 
rapidly in the medium term, as the country’s road network is improved and people become 
wealthier. Policy decisions are therefore critical to ensure that the transport sector’s 
developmental pathway prioritises sustainability and efficiency.
Practically all vehicles in Azerbaijan are imported. Around two-fifths are second-hand, and 
as the number of these imports has been rising in recent years, older vehicles with lower 
energy performance are having a significant impact on the sector’s energy consumption. 
To improve energy efficiency and limit air pollution, the government should set minimum 
energy efficiency requirements for all vehicles imported and sold, including second-hand 
ones.
Measures to raise Azerbaijan’s fuel prices and taxes – which are among the lowest in the 
world – are critical to improve energy efficiency and limit pollution and CO2 emissions from 
transport. This could be done in a revenue-neutral manner. A scrappage system could 
also be considered for old light- and heavy-duty vehicles and buses, as they tend to pollute 
more. Projects to scrap old vehicles have been carried out in recent years, and Azerbaijan 
does offer incentives under certain conditions for the purchase of vehicles that use lowcarbon fuels, but specific subsidies for direct vehicle purchases appear to be an expensive 
policy measure.
More ambitious policy attention should be given to railway use, as increased rail transport 
could yield multiple benefits. A positive development is the commissioning of a new railway 
line connecting Baku to Ganja in 2018, and policies and programmes promoting further 
 All rights reserved.ENERGY SYSTEM TRANSFORMA
quality and reduces noise and congestion. Those who would particularly benefit from this 
transition are people living in cities with high pollution, such as the Greater Baku area, 
where almost half of Azerbaijan’s population lives and nearly half of all its vehicles are 
registered. Although public transport availability has improved in recent years with 
expansion of the Baku metro, it will be important to integrate public transport 
considerations into urban planning to create a more sustainable and efficient transport 
system as Azerbaijan’s population continues to urbanise. 
Industry
Industry accounted for 26% of Azerbaijan’s TFC in 2019. In absolute terms, industry sector
TFC has fluctuated over the past two decades and is 40% higher than in 2008.
International practice shows that price signals are the most effective way to incentivise 
industry to implement energy efficiency measures, but Azerbaijan’s non-cost-reflective 
energy tariffs do not provide them. Its tariff design does not stimulate efficient use of the 
electricity system because electricity prices do not depend on voltage and capacity, and timeof-use pricing and peak pricing have not been instituted for all consumers (ECS, 2020). Tariff 
reform is therefore also essential for the industry sector.
As tariff reform would likely increase energy prices for industry, including small and 
medium-sized enterprises, the government could consider temporary measures to 
neutralise the impact of energy costs on competitiveness, where necessary. Investing in 
energy-efficient equipment could quickly generate financial savings that would allow 
industries to spend more on their core business operations. As the IEA explains in its 2020 
Sustainable Recovery report, payback periods for investing in more energy-efficient 
industrial electric motors, heat pumps for low-temperature process heat and agricultural 
irrigation pumps are typically attractive. Governments can encourage energy efficiency 
investments by introducing mandatory state-level energy audits and by offering financial 
incentives (tax deductions, guaranteed lending, rebates, cash-for-replacement schemes) 
as well as specific incentives for energy management systems and the training and hiring 
of energy managers (IEA, 2020a). Azerbaijan’s government should consider including 
incentives such as these in its draft energy efficiency law.

Total renewable energy supply: 0.23 Mtoe (1.4% of TES): hydropower 0.13 Mtoe (0.8% of

World renewable energy shares (2018): 13.5% of TES and 25.2% of electricity generation
Overview
Azerbaijan has excellent renewable energy potential. In addition to being quite sunny and 
windy, the country also has considerable hydro, bioenergy and geothermal resources, but 
its energy policy has focused until recently on developing Azerbaijan’s significant oil and 
gas resources. This focus is changing, however: the government is now drafting legislation 
to promote renewable energy and is aiming for renewable energy to provide 30% of 
electricity generating capacity by 2030, roughly twice the current share. Major contracts to 
build wind and solar power capacity were signed in early 2020.
Supply 
The share of renewable energy sources (RES) in Azerbaijan’s total energy supply (TES) 
has been stable – but low – since the 1990s. The portion of RES in electricity generation 
was higher during 2008-2019, ranging from 7% to 18% of total generation. This strong 
variation reflects the country’s changing hydrological conditions and, in consequence, its 
hydropower output. The dominance of hydropower in RES leads to similarities in the 
patterns of RES in TES and RES in total final consumption (TFC) (Figure 8.1). 
Hydropower accounted for 59% of total renewable energy supply in 2019, with the 
remainder coming mainly from municipal waste and bioenergy (Figure 8.2). With a 
combined installed capacity of 102 megawatts (MW) in 2019, wind power and solar PV 
shares remain small, but the government has indicated a strong desire to develop the 
sector. Statistics for heat pumps were available for the first time in 2018, showing a total 
installed capacity of 1.4 MW. Heat pumps are also in the early stages of utilisation in the 
country.

Azerbaijan’s bioenergy supply totalled 0.12 Mtoe in 2019 and consisted of renewable 
municipal waste and primary solid biofuels (Figure 8.3). Municipal waste has been used 
since 2012 at the Baku solid waste incineration plant. The plant can incinerate 0.5 Mt of 
solid waste per year to generate around 200 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity annually. 
Solid biofuels are used mostly in the commercial and residential sectors for space heating 
and, in some cases, cooking.
Following a peak in hydropower generation, the supply of energy from renewables and 
waste has declined since 2010. In addition to being caused by hydropower fluctuations, 
this drop reflects the reduced use of wood for heating, a result of the government’s policy 
to expand the natural gas network and promote natural gas as a clean and modern heating 
option. At less than 2%, the share of RES in Azerbaijan’s TES was well below the world 
average in 2018 (Figure 8.4).

Renewable electricity generation
In 2019, Azerbaijan had a total installed renewable electricity capacity of 1 291 MW. 
Renewable energy accounted for 17% of the country’s total installed capacity and for 7% 
(1.81 terawatt hours [TWh]) of its electricity generation. 
Azerbaijan’s renewable electricity comes primarily from hydropower (Figure 8.5). From 
2008 to 2019, hydropower capacity increased by around 15% to 1 145 MW. The major 
change was the 2010-2017 refurbishment of the Mingachevir hydropower plant (HPP) and 
its capacity upgrade from 284 MW to 424 MW. Wind power capacity was 66 MW, of which 
50 MW was added in 2018, and that of solar PV was 35 MW in 2018.

to increase both the total capacity and the share of renewable power generation.

Increasing the share of variable renewable energy (VRE) – namely solar and wind power 
– in electricity generation will have implications for power system operations. The IEA has 
identified six phases of VRE integration, each with its own challenges and responses (IEA, 
2017) (Figure 8.7). With its minor solar and wind generation, Azerbaijan – like most other 
countries today – is in Phase 1, in which VRE integration should not pose any difficulties.

Renewable energy potential
Although a comprehensive atlas of Azerbaijan’s renewable energy resources has not yet 
been published, several studies since the late 1990s have indicated significant untapped 
potential, mainly for solar and wind energy, but also for hydropower, biomass and 
geothermal resources. 
Solar
According to the Ministry of Energy (MoE), Azerbaijan’s technical solar power potential is 
around 23 000 MW. The country has 2 400 to 3 200 hours of sunshine per year and its 
annual solar intensity is estimated at 1 500 kilowatt hours per square metre (kWh/m2) to 
2 000 kWh/m2; both values are high compared with other countries. The best resources 
are in the central river valleys and in the north and northwest of the country.

Azerbaijan has around 3 000 MW of technical and around 800 MW of economic wind 
power potential according to the MoE. Harnessing the economic potential could generate 
around 2.4 TWh per year, which would conserve around 500 million cubic metres (mcm) 
of natural gas and avoid 1 Mt of CO2 emissions. The best resources are along the Caspian 
Sea, particularly on the Absheron Peninsula, where wind speeds average around 6 m per 
second and are higher than that from January to April and from September to December 
(CIC, 2013; Kerimov, Ismailova and Rahmanov, 2013). 
At the time of writing (October 2020), the MoE and the regulator, along with the 
International Financial Corporation, were preparing a roadmap for offshore wind in 
Azerbaijan. The goal is to identify potentially rich wind energy areas, their economic 
viability, network connectivity and possible onshore and offshore environmental impacts.

Hydropower
Hydropower is currently Azerbaijan’s primary source of renewable energy, but its potential 
has not been fully exploited. Modernising large hydropower installations would increase 
their capacity, and for small hydropower, numerous small mountain rivers in various 
regions of the country offer potential. According to the MoE, the technical potential for 
small hydro is 520 MW, which could generate up to 3.2 TWh annually. The MoE will 
prepare a strategy to develop small hydropower, based on water potential, water shortages 
and the country’s power generation needs (MoE, 2020). Water availability has recently 
received government attention at the highest level (Eurasianet, 2020). 
Geothermal 
The former State Agency on Alternative and Renewable Energy Resources (SAARES) 
estimates Azerbaijan’s geothermal energy potential to be up to 800 MW. Initial studies 
indicate that Azerbaijan has 11 geothermal zones with water temperatures ranging from 
30°C to 100°C (ANAS, 2004). 
 All rights reserved.disposed of at waste treatment sites in Azerbaijan annually could be used to generate heat 
and/or electricity in Baku and other large industrial cities.
Institutions 
The MoE oversees renewable energy policy. Policy implementation was delegated to 
SAARES from 2009 to 2018, but the agency was abolished in 2018 and its functions 
transferred to the MoE. In September 2020, the President of Azerbaijan signed a decree 
establishing the State Agency for Renewable Energy Sources. The new agency will report 
to the MoE.
Policies and measures 
Azerbaijan’s energy supply relies on the country’s abundant oil and natural gas resources, 
and interest in using renewable energy has begun to increase only recently. The 
government recognises that using more renewable energy in power generation can help 
diversify the country’s energy sources as well as divert natural gas from power generation 
to potentially more profitable exports and use in petrochemicals, in addition to helping the 
country meet its Paris Agreement climate objectives. 
Azerbaijan does not have a specific renewable energy strategy or action plan. In 2014, 
SAARES drafted a national strategy on the use of alternative and renewable energy 
sources for 2015-2020, but the document was not formally adopted (ECS, 2020). However, 
the 2016 Strategic Roadmap for the Development of Utilities (Electricity, Heating, Water 
and Gas) in the Republic of Azerbaijan included the addition of 420 MW of renewable 
electricity capacity by 2020: 350 MW of wind, 50 MW of solar and 20 MW of bioenergy.
The government is aiming for renewable energy to provide 30% of electricity generating 
capacity in the country by 2030, and in May 2020 the Cabinet of Ministers approved the 
Action Plan on Attracting Additional Investments in the Renewable Energy Sector (MoE, 
2020). The role for renewable energy in heat supply is small, and no direct involvement in 
transport is envisaged.
Draft renewable electricity law
As of October 2020, Azerbaijan did not have a regulatory framework for renewable energy, 
except for specific purchase tariffs for certain types of renewable electricity and tax 
exemptions for companies purchasing renewable energy equipment and generating 
renewable energy (see section below). 
However, a law on renewable electricity is in the works. Following instructions from the 
Cabinet of Ministers in March 2018, the MoE has prepared a draft Law on Renewable 
Energy Sources in Electricity Generation. The draft was to be submitted to the President 
of the Republic of Azerbaijan by the end of May 2020.
 All rights reserved.ENERGY SYSTEM TRANSFORMA
Current incentives
The government offers tax and tariff exemptions to promote renewable electricity 
generation and alternative energy production. Qualifying companies and entrepreneurs 
are exempt from customs duties and, for a period of seven years, value-added tax for 
technical equipment and facilities. They are also exempted from paying property tax, land 
tax and half their income tax (Aydin, 2019).
Azerbaijan’s electricity market is strongly regulated, and all electricity tariffs, including 
purchase tariffs for RES generators, are set by the Tariff Council. For small hydropower, 
the tariff is AZN 0.05 (USD 0.029) per kWh; for wind power it is AZN 0.055 (USD 0.032 US 
cents) per kWh; and for other renewable energy it is up to AZN 0.057 (USD 0.034) per 
kWh. Large hydropower is not eligible for a purchase tariff. For comparison, the wholesale 
electricity tariff in Azerbaijan has been AZN 0.057/kWh since 2016. 
Permitting
Renewable electricity facilities are granted permits in a four-step process. First, local 
authorities award a land use permit, then a construction permit is granted by the Ministry 
of Ecology and Natural Resources, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Emergency 
Situations. Third, electricity generation is permitted by the MoE,1 and fourth, a permit for 
network connection is granted by the network owner (the transmission system operator or 
the distribution system operator; see Chapter 4). 
Current projects
In a significant development for Azerbaijan’s renewable energy sector, in January 2020 
the MoE signed implementing agreements for the country’s first two independent power 
projects, under which ACWA Power of Saudi Arabia will build, own and operate 240 MW 
of wind power, and Masdar of the United Arab Emirates will develop, build and operate 
230 MW of solar PV capacity. The two companies were selected in a three-stage process 
from the seven companies that submitted proposals (ACWA, 2020; Masdar, 2020). The 
projects are backed by 20-year PPAs, the details of which have not been disclosed. The 
MoE and Azerenergy, the power offtaker, signed the main project agreements, including 
the PPAs, with ACWA Power in December 2020 and with Masdar in March 2021.
The MoE expects the USD 400 million projects to generate 1.4 TWh of renewable 
electricity per year, save more than 300 mcm of natural gas that would otherwise be used 
for power generation, reduce CO2 emissions by more than 0.6 Mt and create hundreds of 
jobs. 
The wind power capacity is to consist of 40 turbines of 6 MW each, 17 of which (102 MW) 
will be built in Pirakashkul in the Absheron region and 23 (138 MW) in a mountainous area 
 
1
 The key document is the 24 November 2016 Resolution No. 482 of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of 
Azerbaijan on the Establishment of Power Limits for the Production of Electricity and Commissioning of Electrical 
Installations. 
 All rights reserved.The MoE is also preparing to construct roughly 1 000 MW of additional renewable 
electricity capacity through competitive bidding processes. It is currently defining and 
prioritising zones of high renewable energy potential, and it will then assess land 
ownership, existing infrastructure and environmental concerns (IRENA, 2019). With the 
help of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the MoE is developing 
renewable energy auctions to attract more private investment to the sector.
To increase the share of renewable energy in the country's total electricity capacity to 30% 
by 2030, the MoE invited the German consulting company VPC to determine the optimal 
limit of new capacity to be connected to the electricity grid. According to its report, 
Azerbaijan needs to install 1 500 MW to reach the 30% target by 2030. VPC suggests 
doing this in three stages: 440 MW in 2020-2022, 460 MW in 2023-2025 and 600 MW in 
2026-2030.
Addressing solar PV development specifically, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is 
financing the design and construction of the country’s first floating solar PV (FPV) plant. 
The 100-kW pilot plant will be installed on Lake Boyukshor, close to Baku. While FPV 
installations require stricter standards than land-based PV because of their exposure to 
water, the advantages over land-based PV are that they are quick to install and land use 
is not an issue. They also allow higher energy yields because of the cooling effect of the 
water (ADB, 2018). Azerbaijan’s many reservoirs offer opportunities to synergise FPV 
technology with existing hydropower generation and related grid infrastructure.
Renewable energy for heat
Natural gas is the default heating fuel in Azerbaijan, but continued reliance on it will not 
allow the country to decarbonise its heat use in the decades ahead. Furthermore, gas 
resources may be better used for exports or as a feedstock for petrochemical production.
District heating, heat pumps and gas heat pumps are all alternatives to individual gas 
boilers, while renewable heat options include solar thermal heating, low-emission biomass 
boilers and geothermal energy with ground-source heat pumps. Solar thermal 
technologies can provide hot water at low operational cost, while geothermal groundsource heat pumps offer efficient and reliable solutions for the whole year, since 
underground temperatures are relatively stable. Geothermal heat pumps enable seasonal 
storage and offer high performance during cold spells (as a heat provider) or heat waves 
(as a cooling provider) (IEA, 2020a).
Azerbaijan’s main renewable energy projects for heating have been the installation of solar 
collectors at the SOS Children’s Village in Baku and solar panels at some educational and 
medical facilities. 
Assessment 
Although Azerbaijan’s energy supply is strongly dominated by oil and natural gas, the 
country also has excellent renewable energy potential that – aside from large hydro – 
 All rights reserved.ENERGY SYSTEM TRANSFORMA
more affordable. Wind and solar power generating costs have fallen significantly over the 
past decade, and in many countries they are now the lowest-cost forms of new generation 
(IEA, 2020b). Relying more on renewable energy would help Azerbaijan save natural gas 
for exports and for use in the petrochemical industry; reduce the country’s GHG emissions 
to meet its 2030 Paris Agreement commitment; and improve electricity security by
diversifying generation. 
As part of its planned energy market reforms, the government has drafted a renewable 
electricity law and aims for renewable energy to provide 30% of electricity generating 
capacity by 2030 – almost twice the 2018 share of 16%. The draft law would provide the 
legal basis to develop renewable energy projects in the country and would introduce 
competitive bidding processes and support mechanisms such as feed-in tariffs. Templates 
for PPAs and connection agreements have also been drafted.
The IEA applauds the government’s increased ambition to develop renewable energy and 
urges it to adopt the pending legislation without delay. This needs to be done in a coordinated manner, consistent with other pending energy reforms, particularly the country’s 
overall energy strategy and the Law on Electricity. Short-, medium- and long-term 
renewable energy targets are needed, as is an action plan that includes policies and 
measures to ensure the targets are met. Progress should be monitored and plans regularly 
updated. 
International experience shows that renewable energy targets are most effective when it 
is clear why they are being adopted. Their level should reflect the economic potential of 
renewable energy, as well as the use of other policies and measures to meet energy policy 
goals. For example, it is often more affordable to meet policy goals by increasing energy 
efficiency than by building new generating capacity. Cost-effectiveness should be a key 
policy choice criterion.
Attracting investment
Increasing the share of renewable electricity capacity to 30% of the total by 2030 means 
much more generating capacity will need to be built, which raises questions about the most 
effective way to do this and what kind of a regulatory regime is needed. Government plans 
include large hydropower, and although solar and wind power offer excellent potential, 
attracting investments in these technologies generally requires adequate remuneration, 
grid access, system integration, and the removal of non-economic barriers. In general, 
renewable energy should be developed as an integral part of the electricity market and 
should be factored into electricity market design at the outset (see Chapter 4). 
Azerbaijan does not have a competitive electricity market to provide price signals for 
investors. At the same time, it has excess electricity generation capacity, and the price of 
the natural gas that fuels 90% of electricity generation is low because it is subsidised.2 As 
long as the state-owned monopoly generator (Azerenergy) receives subsidised gas for 
 
2 In 2019, the natural gas export price averaged AZN 33 (USD 19) per megawatt hour (MWh), while the price of gas 
for domestic electricity generation was set at AZN 12 per MWh. The fixed annual wholesale electricity price was AZN 
57 per MWh.
 All rights reserved.competition from natural gas domestically as a result.
While the purpose of the pending electricity market reform is to introduce more competition 
and dynamism to the sector, the government could also make renewable energy more 
cost-competitive by phasing out fossil fuel subsidies and introducing carbon pricing or a 
revenue-neutral carbon tax. Fuel subsidy reform, which is dealt with more fully in other 
chapters, would offer numerous benefits. Together with carbon pricing, it would help the 
country meet its CO2 emissions reduction targets and save gas for exports and for 
petrochemical production. Fuel subsidy reform and carbon pricing or a revenue-neutral 
carbon tax offer a much better way forward than direct subsidies for renewable energy, 
which would be inefficient both for the energy sector and for the national economy.
Competitive bidding and long-term purchase agreements 
Finding the optimal level of remuneration for renewable electricity will be challenging as 
long as the country does not have a competitive electricity market. To overcome similar 
investment challenges, many countries have used auctions (centralised, competitive 
procurement of renewable energy capacity through a government or public body), and 
they have been instrumental in driving down prices, especially for solar PV and wind (IEA, 
2018a). They are typically accompanied by long-term PPAs.
In fact, Azerbaijan has already begun to use auctions and PPAs to attract renewable 
energy investors. In December 2020, the MoE and Azerenergy signed a 20-year PPA for 
a 240-MW wind farm with Saudi Arabia’s ACWA Power and in March 2021 for a 230-MW 
solar power project with Abu Dhabi’s Masdar. These are very promising developments.
Although PPAs help facilitate project financing, as they reduce the perceived project risk, 
they should be used with care. As the World Bank finds in its study of power market reforms 
across the world since the 1990s, long-term contracts can distort power dispatch and build 
contractual rigidity into the power system, both of which significantly limit the scope for 
competition when a wholesale market is eventually introduced. On the other hand, while 
wholesale markets should provide price signals for dispatch and new capacity 
investments, they do not guarantee those investments. Two suggestions can be offered to 
balance these considerations: first, using supply auctions may well be worthwhile to ensure 
that investment takes place, especially as the auctions can be geared towards specific 
policy goals or technologies (Foster and Rana, 2020). Before the electricity market is fully 
functional, annually adjusted price caps could be introduced to limit the risk of collusion. 
Second, a mechanism should be designed to integrate PPAs into the future market. 
It could make sense to expand renewable capacity in increments to allow time for rising
electricity demand to counterbalance the current power generation capacity surplus, and 
for electricity market reforms to be implemented. This should in turn reduce the need for 
long-term PPAs that could otherwise lock in a large segment of renewable energy supply 
outside the competitive market, reducing efficiency and incentives for innovation in the 
sector.

created with the offshore oil and gas companies already operating in the country.
Grid integration and the need for more power system 
flexibility
As VRE shares expand, new approaches to electricity market design and investments in 
grid infrastructure will be needed. Establishing a regulatory framework that facilitates the 
integration of renewables should be part of the electricity market reform: for example, clear 
rules are needed on how to organise power dispatch and how to allocate and govern grid 
connection costs. Auctions for solar and wind capacity should ideally incorporate system 
costs. 
Increasing solar and wind power generation capacity considerably (to more than 10% of 
total generation) would require Azerbaijan’s power system to become more flexible to 
accommodate the natural daily and seasonal variations of these energy sources (see 
Figure 8.7). The country’s most obvious sources of flexibility are its combined-cycle gas 
turbine, gas engine and hydropower plants, and it could strengthen its electricity networks. 
Additional options include stronger cross-border connections, electricity trading, and 
storage ranging from minutes to hours and days (for example, pumped hydro and district 
heating systems with thermal storage; see Chapter 5). Financial incentives to put these 
measures in place and to establish demand-response capabilities should be considered 
as part of the electricity market reform. Emerging flexibility options include grid-scale 
batteries and hydrogen production, but reducing their cost continues to be a major 
challenge (IEA, 2020a; 2020b).
One intriguing option is the installation of FPV capacity on reservoirs connected to HPPs. 
Azerbaijan has several reservoirs suitable for this, the largest of which is the 605-km2
Mingachevir HPP reservoir. Although FPV is a nascent technology, coupling it with 
hydropower would offer several advantages. Transmission costs should be low, as FPV 
equipment could be linked to the HPP substation and no extra grids would need to be built. 
Also, solar and hydro generation could balance each other, as dry seasons offer the 
highest solar resources while rainy seasons offer the best hydro potential. A hybrid FPVhydro plant could also use pumped hydro technology to store excess solar power. 
Faster permitting
Permitting renewable energy projects is often a complex and sometimes lengthy process. 
Ideally, the whole procedure – from site selection to gathering basic data for project 
evaluation and planning, to negotiating terms and conditions with the government – should 
involve close co-ordination of all relevant government agencies. Azerbaijan’s government 
should explore how to streamline the licensing process, and recognise that project 
implementation could be made more efficient through the use of tools such as requests for 
prequalification (RFPQs), requests for proposal (RFPs) and government support 
agreements (GSAs). Ideally, the entire permitting and licensing process would be 
managed through a single point of contact (i.e. a one-stop shop). 
 All rights reserved.out, keeping in mind lessons learned from other countries. Renewable heat could also be 
provided in these areas, both directly (e.g. through clean bioenergy, geothermal or solar 
heat) and indirectly (through heat pumps).
The government should install off-grid renewable energy technologies through pilot 
programmes to ensure cost-effective energy access to all parts of the country. These pilots 
should incorporate the sustainable use of local renewable energy resources for heat.
The government could consider providing incentives for small renewable energy suppliers, 
to encourage entrepreneurship and the establishment of small businesses in the energy 
sector. 
Recommendations
The government of Azerbaijan should:
 Evaluate the economic potential of renewable energy and use the assessment results 
to design an action plan to take advantage of that potential. 
 Set renewable energy targets that take account of the cost-effectiveness of all 
available policy options and of the need for consistency with electricity market reform 
measures.
 Minimise the costs of additional renewable energy capacity through competitive 
bidding processes and by identifying ways to incorporate long-term PPAs into the 
competitive electricity market the government plans to introduce.
 Take account of the need for renewable energy integration in plans to develop and 
and upgrade the grid.
 Facilitate renewable energy capacity increases by streamlining authorisation and 
licensing processes as well as project implementation procedures, keeping in mind the 
case for establishing a single point of contact and for ensuring that grid connection 
rules do not discourage renewable electricity. 
 Develop and implement programmes to install solar collectors, batteries and other 
independent renewable energy technologies in remote parts of the country to ensure 
cost-effective access to energy in those areas. 
 Consider providing incentives for small renewable energy suppliers, to encourage
entrepreneurship and the establishment of small businesses in the energy sector.

9. Energy research, development and 
demonstration 
Overview
The Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences (ANAS) co‑ ordinates academic research, 
while the Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of Transport, Communications and High 
Technologies, the Azerbaijan State Oil and Industrial University and the State Oil Company 
of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) carry out research and development (R&D) activities in 
their own institutes or by funding other organisations. Private businesses, international 
financial institutions (IFIs) and donors also contribute to R&D. 
Nevertheless, Azerbaijan has significant potential to increase its R&D activities, including 
in the energy field, with the support of long-term planning. Overall spending on R&D is low, 
and the country does not yet have a specific strategy or action plan for energy R&D. 
Funding 
According to the Science Development Foundation, Azerbaijan’s total R&D spending over 
the past decade equates to around 0.2% of its GDP (SDF, 2020). This is around half what
the lowest-spending Organisation for Economic Co‑ operation and Development (OECD)
member country spends, and less than one-tenth of the OECD average (around 2.5% of 
GDP), but is similar to the R&D spending of many of Azerbaijan’s neighbours. 
R&D is primarily publicly funded, 86% from public research institutions and 9% from higher 
education establishments, while private sector funding covers only 5%. More than 80% of 
total funding is allocated to basic research, and less than 20% to applied R&D. The level 
of competitive funding (project-based and grants) remains negligible (WB, 2018). Around 
65% of total funding has been allocated to the natural and technical sciences in recent 
years, but detailed information about energy R&D spending is not available. 
Energy research institutions
Azerbaijan has a number of research and higher education institutions that carry out 
energy technology R&D. They have participated in national and international programmes 
and projects, enabling Azerbaijani scientists and researchers to contribute to the 
development of these projects while acquiring new skills and knowledge.

 SOCAR’s Oil and Gas Research and Design Institute
 the Azerbaijan State University of Architecture and Construction 
 the Baku Higher Oil School.
Developing relevant skills and know-how, for example through better schooling and 
greater participation in higher education programmes, is necessary to carry out R&D 
activities. Such knowledge and capabilities are also critical for Azerbaijan to develop its 
economy more generally. Although steps are being taken to make improvements, the 
Asian Development Bank (ADB) has suggested that more resources and a more effective 
institutional setup and cohesive policy framework are needed to further develop the 
country’s infrastructure and human capital (ADB, 2019). 
The 2019‑ 2023 State Programme on Increasing the International Competitiveness of the 
Higher Education System promotes dual-degree programmes with highly rated universities
in other countries. For example, the Baku Higher Oil School, in conjunction with the 
Geneva Business School, is introducing a dual-diploma MBA in Oil and Gas Management.
Energy technology innovation 
According to the Word Bank, Azerbaijan’s public sector R&D institutions, which focus 
primarily on basic research, have relatively weak links with the private sector and, 
consequently, there is scope to improve the country’s commercialisation and general 
innovation performance (patents, etc.) (WB, 2018). The ADB has also argued that private 
sector participation in R&D should be increased. To this end, in January 2019 the president 
issued an order on Ensuring Co‑ ordination in the Field of Innovative Development in the 
Republic of Azerbaijan.
Efforts to stimulate innovation include the establishment of technology parks, which are 
typically offered tax, land acquisition and customs benefits. The High Tech Research 
Center under the Ministry of Transport, Communications and High Technologies was 
established in 2008 to import advanced technologies to Azerbaijan and develop sciencebased industries in the country. The Center has developed prototypes of light-emitting 
diodes (LEDs) and a small-scale LED production line, for example. 
ANAS’s High Technologies Park (HTP) was created by a presidential decree of 8 
November 2016. The HTP aims to establish application mechanisms for industry-driven 
projects, provide technological innovation for mass production, and facilitate practical work 
in the field of science and technology. Petrochemicals is one of the HTP’s focus areas.

innovation. The park organises competitions and provides funding to help students

per year for research, together with the National Academy of Science; it also offers
stipends for scientists. The Institute’s work covers a wide range of petroleum industry 
activities: geological and geophysical surveys of prospects and oil and gas fields; 
exploration, and the preparation of prospects for development; oil and gas field 
development; well drilling, completion and operation; petrochemical and petroleum 
processing engineering; petroleum industry economic and management studies; the 
preparation of short-term reservoir engineering strategies; environmental protection; and 
the processing, storage and transportation of petroleum products (SOCAR, 2020). 
Assessment 
RDI activities are necessary to help Azerbaijan maintain and improve the competitiveness 
of its economy and diversify it away from oil and gas. The country has the means to 
increase its RDI potential and make better use of it, but stronger efforts and a long-term 
commitment are required. 
Several of Azerbaijan’s research and education institutions have been important in setting 
the country on the path to further technological progress. They have participated in various 
national and international programmes and projects, enabling Azeri scientists and 
researchers to contribute to the work being done while acquiring new skills and knowledge. 
At the same time, RDI governance in Azerbaijan remains fragmented, as do its systems. 
Policy and funding are not as well co‑ordinated as they could be and would benefit from 
streamlining. A welcome sign of improvement and interest is the January 2019 presidential 
order on Ensuring Co‑ordination in the Field of Innovative Development in the Republic of 
Azerbaijan.
Total R&D spending remains at 0.2% of GDP, which is low by international standards, so 
there is a strong case to be made for increasing spending and changing the country’s 
approach. R&D is primarily funded from Azerbaijan’s state budget, with the private sector 
providing only 5% of the total, whereas in developed economies the private sector covers 
the majority of R&D expenditures, followed by higher education institutions. Furthermore, 
the share of funding allocated to applied research in Azerbaijan is low (less than 20% of 
the total) and should be raised to develop the economy’s non-oil sectors; the level of 
competitive funding (project-based and grants) should also be increased. Active policies 
to promote co-operation among public research institutions, universities and the private 
sector will be required to enact the necessary revisions.
Regarding energy RDI specifically, the government should develop a strategy, policies and 
programmes. It should also encourage and facilitate wider participation in international RDI 
programmes and projects.
As Azerbaijan’s economy, as well as its energy research and technology base, is 
dominated by the oil and gas industry, there is a strong argument for diversification focused 
on energy efficiency and renewable energy. RDI in the field of energy efficiency and 
 All rights reserved.technologies for power, district heating and cooling (DHC) and gas networks as well as 
new oil and gas sector technologies, notably carbon capture, utilisation and storage 
(CCUS).
For the oil and gas industry, international experience offers models of resource 
development compatible with deep decarbonisation, with especial focus on CCUS, 
hydrogen production and strategies to find and develop non-combustion uses for 
hydrocarbons. Incorporating CCUS into petrochemical production may be particularly 
rewarding, given the potential for cost-efficient carbon storage options (IEA, 2020a). 
Depleted oil and gas reservoirs also merit careful consideration because they could be 
one of the lowest-cost CO2 storage options in a future in which hundreds of millions of 
tonnes of CO2 will need to be stored. The availability of inexpensive natural gas and CO2
storage could also provide a comparative advantage in the production of clean hydrogen. 
Furthermore, as technologies to capture CO2 and to inject it for enhanced oil recovery are 
commercially mature and have been applied in industry for decades, they could be used 
to boost oil production from existing assets as well as reduce Azerbaijan’s overall 
emissions intensity and avoid the need for new production infrastructure.
Recommendations
The government of Azerbaijan should:
 Formulate an integrated energy RDI strategy based on close co-ordination among 
ANAS, the Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of Transport, Communications and High 
Technologies, SOCAR, private sector businesses, and IFIs and donors in the field; 
include measures to ensure their continued co-operation for effective implementation 
of the strategy. 
 Establish a framework to develop infrastructure and knowledge related to sustainable 
technologies, especially energy efficiency and renewable energy, in the RDI strategy.
 Include in the RDI strategy: 
> a mixture of base financing and competitive project-based granting 
> support for innovative SMEs and start-ups
> support for research on climate change and adaptation in the energy sector 
> measures to further develop university technology parks 
> measures to strengthen the country’s capacity to participate in international RDI 
and education programmes, including Horizon Europe 2021-2027, and to develop
a national contact point.

 Facilitate access to available technology transfer options offered by climate funds, IFIs 
and donors, build up relevant policy capacity, and promote the development of relevant 
projects. 
 Track public energy-related R&D funding in detail (e.g. by technology and energy
source) to inform energy-related R&D policy decisions.

 All rights reserved.development and to the well-being of their people and the environment. In formulating energy policies, 
the establishment of free and open markets is a fundamental point of departure, though energy security 
and environmental protection need to be given particular emphasis by governments. IEA countries 
recognise the significance of increasing global interdependence in energy. They therefore seek to 
promote the effective operation of international energy markets and encourage dialogue with all 
participants. To secure their objectives, member countries therefore aim to create a policy framework 
consistent with the following goals:
1. Diversity, efficiency and flexibility within the energy sector are basic conditions for longer-term 
energy security: the fuels used within and across sectors and the sources of those fuels should be as 
diverse as practicable. Non-fossil fuels, particularly nuclear and hydro, make a substantial contribution to 
the energy supply diversity of IEA countries as a group.
2. Energy systems should have the ability to respond promptly and flexibly to energy emergencies. 
In some cases, this requires collective mechanisms and action: IEA countries co-operate through the 
Agency in responding jointly to oil supply emergencies.
3. The environmentally sustainable provision and use of energy are central to the achievement of 
these shared goals. Decision makers should seek to minimise the adverse environmental impacts of energy 
activities, just as environmental decisions should take account of the energy consequences. Government 
interventions should respect the Polluter Pays Principle when practicable.
4. More environmentally acceptable energy sources need to be encouraged and developed. Clean 
and efficient fossil fuel use is essential. The development of economic non-fossil sources is also a priority. 
A number of IEA member countries wish to retain and improve the nuclear option for the future, at the 
highest available safety standards, because nuclear energy does not emit carbon dioxide. Renewable 
energy sources will also have an increasingly important contribution to make.
5. Improved energy efficiency can promote both environmental protection and energy security in a costeffective manner. There are significant opportunities for greater energy efficiency at all stages of the 
energy cycle, from production to consumption. Strong efforts by governments and all energy users are 
needed to realise these opportunities.
6. Continued research, development and market deployment of new and improved energy 
technologies make a critical contribution to achieving the objectives outlined above. Energy technology 
policies should complement broader energy policies. International co-operation in the development and 
dissemination of energy technologies, including industry participation and co-operation with non-member
countries, should be encouraged.
 All rights reserved.ANN
8. Free and open trade and a secure framework for investment contribute to efficient energy markets 
and energy security. Distortions to energy trade and investment should be avoided.
9. Co-operation among all energy market participants helps improve information access and 
understanding, and encourages the development of efficient, environmentally acceptable and flexible 
energy systems and markets worldwide. These are needed to help promote the investment, trade and 
confidence necessary to achieve global energy security and environmental objectives.

Energy Policy Review
Oil and gas continue to dominate Azerbaijan’s economy and provide most of its export and 
government revenue. While these resources have sharply raised the country’s living 
standards since the late 1990s and remain plentiful, the long-term outlook for this economic 
model is uncertain. Oil production is declining and major oil and gas importing countries 
have pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by mid-century, implying little 
demand three decades from now for oil or gas without carbon capture and storage.
This report assesses the energy sector and related economic challenges facing Azerbaijan. 
It proposes several ways to respond by increasing the efficiency and diversity of domestic 
energy supply and use. The overriding recommendation is a gradual transition to competitive 
markets with significant private sector participation and energy prices that reflect the cost of 
production. The withdrawal of subsidies should be accompanied by support measures for 
those most in need. Such a transition would attract new market entrants and new 
investments, helping to develop Azerbaijan’s significant solar and wind potential, and limiting 
greenhouse gas emissions.
These recommendations are in line with efforts already underway in Azerbaijan. Prompted by 
the oil price shock in 2014-15, the government has recently drafted proposals for electricity 
and gas market reforms, as well as laws on energy efficiency and renewable energy. The 
country’s first specific energy strategy is also nearing completion. The report encourages 
Azerbaijan to move swiftly to adopt all these proposals and implement them effectively to 
ensure secure and sustainable energy in the future.
