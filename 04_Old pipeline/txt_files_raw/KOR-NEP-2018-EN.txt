National Action Plan for Electric Mobility
April 2018 In our country, outdoor air pollution has become an urgent 
issue. Every year, is contributes to an estimated 9,000 
premature deaths in Kathmandu Valley alone. In our fight 
against air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, the 
electrification of the transport sector is an important goal 
because widespread electrification would greatly improve 
the quality of the air we breathe. And in fact, switching to 
electric vehicles has been a core target of the Ministry of 
Forests and Environment since 2015, when Nepal’s 
Nationally Determined Contribution was established.
But switching to electric is challenging and much needs to 
change. This National Action Plan for Electric Mobility
charts a path ahead for the achievement of the ambitious 
electric mobility targets we adopted under the Nationally 
Determined Contribution, supported by policy from the 
Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport. The plan 
identifies both the major barriers that constrain us and 
proposes ideas and strategies for solutions and 
opportunities that can lead us forward. Success with the 
plan’s many recommendations will require proactivity and 
optimism from a range of government, private sector and 
civil society partners.
I would like to thank the team that assembled this plan, 
including experts from the Ministry of Forests and 
Environment, the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and 
Transport, and the Global Green Growth Institute, as well 
as private sector and civil society partners. As Nepal moves 
toward greater and greater sustainability, this plan acts as
an important guide for cleaning our air and greening our 
transport sector. 
Bishwa Nath Oli, Ph.D
Secretary
Ministry of Forests and EnvironmentWe are a landlocked country and to meet our demand for 
fossil fuel, we must import all our oil needs, costing an 
estimated NPR 108 billion (USD 1.3 billion) during the last 
fiscal year (2073/74). But the other side of the coin looks 
better - we have immense hydropower potential. There is 
an estimated 83,000 MW of energy in our rivers, and we 
are currently capturing only a fraction of that. This makes 
electric vehicles well positioned to assume a much greater 
role within our transport systems. In addition, electric 
vehicles are cheaper to run than conventional vehicles.
The Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport 
believes that the electrification of the transport sector is 
the way forward. For over a decade, we have been setting 
out ambitious, sustainable and low-carbon transport policy 
and targets. We need to ensure that all the supporting and 
enabling conditions are in place to stimulate growth in 
electric vehicles, and this plan is a valuable contribution to 
this. The many actions in the plan collectively chart a path 
forward, supporting the transport sector into a bold new 
electric future.
Madhusuda Adhikari
Secretary
Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and TransportI would like to thank the leaders of the Ministry of Forests 
and Environment and the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure 
and Transport for giving the Global Green Growth Institute 
the opportunity to support the Government of Nepal by 
developing this National Action Plan for Electric Mobility. 
The Institute’s Nepal office is hosted by the Ministry of 
Forests and Environment, and we are particularly grateful 
to Dr. Oli for his ongoing guidance. In many of Nepal’s 
sectors, ambitious policy and targets are in place for a 
greener, more sustainable and inclusive future, and the 
Global Green Growth Institute is actively working alongside 
the Government of Nepal to help realize these. 
We believe the actions presented in this plan, if realized by 
government and partners, can make a significant difference 
to the sustainability of Nepal’s transport sector, and as a 
result, the prosperity, health and well-being of Nepal’s 
people and environment. We are confident that these 
actions are well designed to generate strategic and 
operational advantages for Nepal, and we stand ready to 
support federal, provincial and local governments with any 
further services to advance implementation.

Stakeholders and Consultations............................................................................................................................................... 94Working under the overall direction of the Ministry of 
Forests and Environment and in partnership with the 
Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, the 
Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) launched the Electric 
Mobility Program in 2017, to support a transition towards 
clean and sustainable transportation in Nepal. Under the 
program, which supports implementation of Nepal’s 
Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) by boosting the 
adoption of electric vehicles in Nepal, this National Action 
Plan for Electric Mobility was developed.
This National Action Plan supports implementation of 
Nepal’s NDC targets for the transport sector. It does this by 
reviewing Nepal’s NDC and related policy (Part 1); exploring 
the transport sector and most effective policy options for 
increased adoption of electric vehicles (Part 2); identifying a 
wide range of barriers and issues that are currently 
restricting adoption of electric vehicles (Part 3); and 
outlining key proposed actions and initiatives for 
overcoming these barriers (Part 4). As well as quantitative 
analyses, the development of the National Action Plan
pursued an intensely participatory process, drawing on 
numerous interviews and focus group discussions with 
government bodies, non-government organizations, 
consumers and the business and research communities. 
Transport and Nepal’s Nationally Determined 
Contribution
Leveraging a history of pioneering electric mobility 
initiatives, Nepal’s Nationally Determined Contribution
includes ambitious targets for low-carbon sustainable 
transport - The Paris Agreement (2015) established the 
NDC as the primary policy mechanism through which global 
action for climate change is expected to take place. Nepal’s
NDC outlines a series of 14 targets. Of these, four targets 
are focused on the transport sector: 
• By 2020, Nepal aims to increase the share of 
electric vehicles up to 20% from 2010 level.
• By 2050, Nepal will decrease its dependency on 
fossil fuel in the transport sector by 50% through 
mass public transport, while promoting energy 
efficient and electric vehicles.
• Nepal will develop its electrical (hydro-powered) 
rail network by 2040 to support mass 
transportation of goods and public commuting.
• By 2025, Nepal will strive to decrease the rate of 
air pollution through proper monitoring of sources 
of air pollutants like wastes, old and unmaintained 
vehicles, and industries.
These transport sector targets are backed by robust policy 
and necessary fiscal and banking incentives - The 
government has put in place a robust policy framework to 
support sustainable and electric transport. In particular, 
this includes the National Transport Policy (2001) and the 
Environment Friendly Transport Policy (2015). This latter 
policy sets specific targets for electric vehicle adoption. 
More broadly, Nepal’s adoption of the Sustainable 
Development Goals further cements an overall policy shift 
towards electric mobility. A supportive fiscal environment is 
also now in place, with a significantly reduced customs tax 
on electric vehicles, and value added tax (VAT) exemption. 
Similarly, the Nepal Central Bank and the Ministry of 
Finance are consistently improving the lending regulations 
to support electric vehicle consumption, for example 
through increased loan-to-value ratios (loan limits).The transport sector is growing rapidly due to 
urbanization, rising incomes and increased road access in
rural areas - Road transport accounts for over 90% of the 
domestic movement of passengers and freight in Nepal. As 
a landlocked country, Nepal does not have direct access to 
any sea ports, and as such the country imports 100% of its 
fossil fuel, and more than 75% of its goods from immediate 
neighbours. Expansion of national and local road networks 
go hand-in hand with economic development and 
urbanization. The total number of registered vehicles grew 
by 14% per annum during 1990-2015. In this, the share of 
registered two-wheelers increased substantially from 55% 
in 1991 to more than 80% in 2014. As a result, the share of 
public buses in the total vehicle fleet declined from 11% in 
1990 to only 3% in 2015.
As a result of rapid transport sector growth and rising 
fossil fuel consumption, greenhouse gas and local 
pollutant emissions are climbing - Greenhouse gas 
emissions grew by 22% per year during 2007-2013, mostly 
due to the rise in number of passenger vehicles on the 
roads. In addition, non-methane volatile organic 
compounds and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions increased 
by 5.4% and 5.2% respectively per year during 1994-2008. 
According to the World Health Organization, poor air
quality contributes to an estimated 9,000 deaths per year in 
Nepal, and a loss of welfare of USD 2.8 billion. 
Increased adoption of electric vehicles across the transport 
sector will reduce final energy consumption, greenhouse 
gas and local pollutant emission, and enhance energy 
security – To address these transport-related challenges, 
sector electrification is needed. For this, a range of 
scenarios are feasible. These scenarios, when modelled,
lead to differing degrees of benefit when compared against 
a baseline case (business as usual). In particular, scenarios 
show that a combination of increased electric mass 
transport and increased adoption of electric passenger 
vehicles will lead to robust benefits through to 2050. Under 
these scenarios, final energy consumption will decrease by 
14-19% compared to business as usual with moderate rises 
in electric mass transport capacity, and moderate increases 
in electric passenger vehicles. Similarly, greenhouse gas 
emissions will decrease by 9-25%, and local pollutant 
emissions by 5-10%. 
gpy fp, 
range of barriers currently restrict greater adoption of 
electric mobility – These barriers can be identified across 
four major areas, namely a) policy and governance; b) 
infrastructure and markets; c) financing and resources; and 
d) data and monitoring (see Figure 1 below). 
Gaps in the policy and governance system for electric 
vehicles undermine operational action and progress on the 
ground – High-level policy needs to be transformed into 
concrete directives, plans and regulation to support a 
switch to electric vehicles. In addition, management of 
public vehicle operators and businesses, and management 
of vehicle distributors need to be strengthened. 
Furthermore, greater political support and leadership for 
electric mobility would help to foster buy-in, investment 
and enthusiasm from consumers and the private sector
Insufficient infrastructure and underdeveloped electric 
vehicle markets discourage consumers and inhibit private 
sector investment and entrepreneurship – Insufficient 
investment in charging stations acts as a major barrier to 
increased adoption of electric vehicles by significantly 
reducing the convenience of electric vehicle ownership. 
There has also been very limited investment in electric 
mass transport infrastructure such as electric rail and 
electric bus systems. In addition, the electric vehicle market 
is underdeveloped: consumers are unaware of the benefits 
of electric vehicles; some vehicle types are difficult to 
purchase; vehicle prices overall remain prohibitively high; 
spare parts are expensive; and electricity supply is 
uncertain. 
Insufficient financing, limited technical and human 
resources, and limited data availability restrict investment 
and business activity for electric mobility and undermines 
decision-making - Although government has provided tax 
relief measures and increased the loan-to-value ratio for 
electric vehicles, a lack of subsidy and other government 
incentives reduces consumption of electric vehicles. In 
addition, there is limited financial support for electric 
vehicle start-ups, which weakens entrepreneurship. Human 
and technical resources for vehicle servicing and testing 
could also be improved. Data on electric vehicles, on the 
current vehicle stock and on air quality and emissions levels 
is under-developed which leads to issues of decisionmaking for policy and regulation. In addition, the lack of 
access to data hampers analysis to assess electric mobility 
options in the country.Figure A.1. Summary of barriers by category
Priority Actions for Electric Mobility
To overcome the barriers outlined above, three strategic 
actions should be prioritized at the national level – These 
priority actions include setting up a national taskforce for 
electric mobility, designing and implementing a national 
program for electric mobility and establishing a national 
financing vehicle for electric mobility (see Figure 2 below). 
Each of these priority actions will deliver progress across 
numerous of the 15 identified barriers. As such, they are 
high-level umbrella actions with multiple operational and 
strategic benefits.
A Unit for Electric Mobility will act as a centralized 
regulatory and promotional entity providing oversight to 
financial and programme initiatives - The proposed unit
could be established either as a unit within an existing 
government entity, or as a quasi-independent government 
entity (taskforce or center, for example) answerable to a 
board comprised of government, business and citizen 
representatives. The fundamental mandate of the unit
would be the promotion of electric mobility across relevant 
transport systems in Nepal, in line with national policy, and 
well as to provide oversight on the proposed program and 
financing vehicle for electric mobility.
A National Program for Electric Mobility will facilitate
public and private acquisition of electric vehicles, invest in 
infrastructure, push for operational progress and refine 
legislation – The proposed program would comprise a suite 
of regulatory, institutional, financing and legislative 
measures designed to collectively provide focused support , pgg 
within the infrastructure and markets space. The program 
would include measures to support consumer and 
government acquisition of electric vehicles, measures to 
support investment in construction of charging stations and 
measures for the legislative changes required for greater 
electric vehicle adoption, and build market awareness. 
A National Financing Vehicle will manage and disburse 
financial support to promote infrastructure, innovation 
and entrepreneurship for electric mobility - The proposed 
financing vehicle will boost business and industry activity 
and investment in electric mobility and electric vehicles. 
Part of the role of the financing vehicle will be to signal 
strong and consistent commitment from government to the 
p ppy 
infrastructure for widespread electric vehicle adoption. 
Lastly, in addition to the three priority actions outlined 
above, a range of contributing initiatives to support 
greater electric mobility in Nepal should be implemented –
These range across a) policy and governance; b) 
infrastructure and markets; c) financing and resources; and 
d) data and monitoring and are designed to act as targeted, 
specific interventions that directly respond to barriers 
identified in Part 3. In this way, such initiatives support the 
three priority actions, and/or can be implemented 
separately, depending on the appetite for action.
Figure A.2. Overview of priority actionsBackground
The Ministry of Forests and Environment produced Nepal’s 
Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) in 2015. The 
NDC effectively gathered targets, strategies and policy goals 
from numerous national policies across a range of sectors. 
As such, the NDC constituted an effort to consolidate 
existing climate change and low-carbon related ambitions 
from across the federal government. An overview of the 
relevant policies upon which the NDC drew are outlined in 
Chapter 2.
However, since the production of the NDC, and its 
submission and adoption at the international level via the 
UNFCCC COP21 platform, implementation has been limited. 
While many of the policy origins of the NDC have 
progressed, as policy efforts in their own right, systematic 
NDC-focused progress has yet to fully emerge. As such, this 
action plan has been formulated by the Global Green 
Growth Institute (GGGI), through extensive consultations 
and in partnership with a range of government bodies, in 
an effort to direct, facilitate and align efforts for investment 
and implementation of the ambitious electric mobilityrelated targets set out under the NDC.
The request to develop this Action Plan, and more generally 
to provide technical assistance to the Government of Nepal 
in implementing the NDC and achieving green growth 
within the transport sector, came from the Ministry of 
Forests and Environment (MOFE). In responding to this 
request, GGGI and MOFE jointly developed the Electric 
Mobility Program, with significant guidance from the 
Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport (MOPIT). 
The Electric Mobility Program, expected to run through to 
2021is designed to boost action and investment for 
electric transportation in Nepal, thereby significantly 
reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the 
transport sector. The first phase of the program (2017-18) 
involves the development of this National Action Plan, to 
guide systematic efforts for electric mobility nationally; as 
well as the development of an investment plan for viable 
electric vehicle projects, and the facilitating of financing for 
these projects; and the initiation of an electric bus pilot 
project in Kathmandu.
Goal and objectives
Within this context, the overall goal of this National Action 
Plan is to facilitate action for the achievement of transport 
provisions laid out under the NDC. 
Such a goal includes the following objectives:
• Undertake a comprehensive review of current 
gaps, barriers and challenges to the 
implementation and/or advancement of the NDC’s 
transport provisions;
• Identify and conceptualize clear and concrete 
action to support implementation of the transport 
provisions of the NDC;
• Engage a comprehensive range of stakeholders, 
including public and private sectors and 
consumers, in participatory dialogue, prioritization 
and action planning for electric mobility; and
• Build the capacity of government partners, civil 
society and transport operators to support and 
advance the transport provisions of the NDC.

targets to support climate change mitigation and 
adaptation in Nepal. Of these targets, four focus on 
climate change adaptation; three focus on energy 
sources and supply; two address the forestry sector; one 
addresses multi-sectoral mitigation; and four address the 
transport sector.
The NDC targets that address the transport sector
include:
• NDC Target 9: By 2020, Nepal aims to increase 
the share of electric vehicle up to 20% from 
2010 level.
• NDC Target 10: By 2050, Nepal will decrease its 
dependency on fossils in the transport sector by 
50% through effective mass public transport 
means while promoting energy efficient and 
electrical vehicles.
• NDC Target 11: Nepal will develop its electrical 
(hydro-powered) rail network by 2040 to 
support mass transportation of goods and 
public commuting.
• NDC Target 14: By 2025, Nepal will strive to 
decrease the rate of air pollution through 
proper monitoring of sources of air pollutants 
like wastes, old and unmaintained vehicles, and 
industries.
This National Action Plan explores barriers to achieving
these four targets and lays out actions and initiatives for 
overcoming them. Above all, given the primacy of road 
transport in Nepal, it supports activities for Target 9, 10 
and 14.

Structure of the report
This action plan is divided into four parts, as outlined 
below:
• Part 1. Electric Mobility in the Nationally 
Determined Contribution and Associated Policy –
The action plan opens with a review of Nepal’s 
NDC. The specific transport-related targets and 
provisions of the NDC are presented. Given the 
role of the NDC as a consolidating mechanism, a 
review of wider policy efforts is also undertaken.
• Part 2. Transport Sector Growth, Emissions and 
Electrification Scenarios – This second part begins 
ppgg
emissions are presented, with an initial focus on 
emissions over the past two decades. Issues 
around local pollutant emissions are also 
presented. Projecting through to 2030 and 2050, 
likely emissions and consumption patterns for the 
transport sector are explored, and three key 
transport electrification scenarios are introduced 
and extrapolated for their impact on their sector. 
• Part 3. Barriers to Electric Mobility – Barriers, 
gaps and challenges to widespread and systematic 
adoption of electric mobility, including the 
achievement of the NDC transport provisions, are 
presented in Part 3. These barriers range across 
four key thematic areas, namely policy and 
governance, infrastructure and markets, finances 
and resources, and data and monitoring. Each of 
the fifteen barriers identified is comprised of a 
series of issues. Barriers and issues were identified 
using the highly consultative process outlined in 
the sections below. 
• Part 4. Actions for Electric Mobility – The fourth
part of the Action Plan lays out three priority 
actions and a suite of contributing initiatives to 
speed up implementation of the NDC’s transport 
provisions. As for Part 3, actions are categorized 
across four thematic areas, namely policy and 
governance, infrastructure and markets, finances 
and resources, and data and monitoring. These 
actions are the result of both qualitative and 
quantitative assessments and respond specifically 
to barriers and issues identified in Part 3, as well as 
medium- and long-term opportunities that can be 
capitalized.
Methods and engagement process
The overall framework for the preparation of this Action 
Plan was set by a combination of GGGI knowledge and 
experience developing NDC implementation tools; globally 
emerging best practices advocated by Ricardo Energy and 
Environment and CDKN (Climate and Development 
Knowledge Network); and the United Nations Development 
Program (UNDP). The GGGI team gratefully acknowledges 
the work of both these agencies in this field and recognizes 
the precedent and best practices they have established. In 
particular, the work and methods of Ricardo Energy and 
Environment were built up in the methodological 
development of this Action Plan, under consultation with Overall, a highly participatory approach was taken, blending 
qualitative and quantitative data, and using data gathering 
methods including key informant interviews with over 
twenty priority stakeholders, focus group discussions with 
transport operators and investors, and a small survey with 
current and prospective electric vehicle consumers. 
The preparation of this National Action Plan followed the 
process outlined below, and presented in Figure 1:
• Review of NDC Technical Literature – A range of 
NDC technical documents and literature were 
reviewed, including UNFCCC, CDKN and UNDP 
documentation, and national action plans and 
strategies for NDC implementation globally.
• Consultation Round 1:
o Key Information Interviews – Priority 
stakeholders were identified, and first 
round consultations were implemented 
using key informant interviews
o Focus Group Discussion - focus group 
discussion methods to constitute a gap 
analysis.
o Consumer Interviews – Current and 
prospective consumers of both electric 
car and electric motorbike were 
interviewed using a structured 
questionnaire.
• Scenario Discussion – Scenarios from a range of 
sources was discussed and analyzed.
• Consultation Round 2
pp
implementation to stakeholders for 
discussion and feedback. Actions were 
then revised based on stakeholder inputs, 
and prioritization.
• Preparation of Draft Action Plan – The draft 
Action Plan was prepared, and reviewed by both 
technical, private sector and government 
stakeholders.
• Validation of Final Action Plan – The finalized 
action plan was validated by lead government 
partners, including MOFE and MOPIT, through 
focused consultations.
Stakeholders and consultations
A comprehensive stakeholder mapping exercise was

and Associated Policy1.1 Introduction
Given the growth of the transport sector, its reliance on 
fossil fuels and its contribution to national greenhouse gas 
emissions, any dedicated mechanism to address climate 
change in Nepal needs to proactively address the sector. 
Nepal’s NDC, which is such a mechanism, provides a range 
of critical targets for transport. These targets, as well as the 
process and role of the NDC at national and global levels, 
are presented below. 
1.2 A Global Mechanism for Managing Climate 
Change
The NDC is a mechanism by which countries agree to 
manage climate change. It is the principal mechanism of 
the Paris Agreement, adopted by 196 parties of the 
UNFCCC, during the 21st Conference of the Parties, in 
December 2015. As such, NDCs constitute the primary 
mechanism through which global action to combat climate 
change is taking place. The Paris Agreement entered into 
effect in November 2016. 
The Paris Agreement deals with greenhouse gas mitigation, 
and climate change adaptation and financing. The overall 
goal of the Paris Agreement, itself the subject of much 
negotiation and contention, is to keep global temperature 
rise, measured against pre-industrial levels, as ‘well below’

2 degrees centigrade, and ideally only 1.5 degrees 
centigrade. The Paris Agreement starts in 2020
Under the Paris Agreement, the NDC mechanism allows 
countries the freedom to determine the extent of their 
contribution to global action for climate change. Countries 
are expected to report on this contribution regularly. 
However, there is no mechanism to enforce compliance 
with targets and goals set by countries under their NDCs. 
1.3 Nepal’s Nationally Determined Contribution
Nepal’s NDC was developed by the MOFE, and was 
submitted to the UNFCC in October, 20161. It covers both 
climate change mitigation and adaptation. The NDC begins 
by outlining Nepal’s vulnerability to climate change. It 
highlights the country’s mountainous terrain and poverty as 
key vulnerability factors. It also outlines current changes in 
climatic conditions which are already observable in Nepal, 
including changes in precipitation and temperature. 
Drawing off Nepal’s Initial National Communication (2004) 
and Second National Communication (2014), the NDC also 
outlines emissions across key sectors.2,3
The NDC follows this with an extensive review of climaterelated institutions, policies, frameworks and activities 
being pursued by the federal government. These include 
institutions in the forestry sector, and policies for climate

and local level. In addition, it outlines mitigation options for 
Nepal, and offers a range of development pathways in 
multiple sectors that will contribute to reduced greenhouse 
gas emissions nationally.
The final section sets out Nepal’s specific contributions. 
These are a series of fourteen targets and broader goals, 
some quantified and others not. Of these fourteen targets, 
four focus on climate change adaptation; three focus on 
energy sources and supply; two address the forestry sector; 
one addresses multi-sectoral mitigation; and four address 
the transportation sector, as below:
• NDC Target 9: By 2020, Nepal aims to increase the 
share of electric vehicles up to 20% from 2010 
level.
• NDC Target 10: By 2050, Nepal will decrease its 
dependency on fossils in the transport sector by 
50% through effective mass public transport 
means while promoting energy efficient and 
electrical vehicles.
• NDC Target 11: Nepal will develop its electrical 
(hydro-powered) rail network by 2040 to support 
mass transportation of goods and public 
commuting.
• NDC Target 14: By 2025, Nepal will strive to 
decrease the rate of air pollution through proper 
monitoring of sources of air pollutants like wastes, 
old and unmaintained vehicles, and industries.

1.4 Compliance and Implementation
Without any formal way to ensure compliance from 
participating governments, implementation is expected to 
come through a mix of genuine political ambition and 
accountability to the international community and local 
electorates. For this, NDCs require robust political backing, 
as well as whole-of-government participation during 
developmental stages. 
Because NDCs are multi-sectoral and wide-ranging, tackling 
issues across the entirety of the development spectrum, 
implementation can be strengthened through integration 
with wider development planning and policy.4In particular, 
such as approach expects national government to integrate 
NDC spending requirements into national budget setting, to 
provide monitoring and oversight through national bodies, 
to provide strong political backing and to ensure cohesion 
and consistency between NDC targets and other 
development goals.
In the case of Nepal’s NDC, much can be done to improve 
scope and capacity for implementation. This includes 
specifically within the transport sector, which is the subject 
of this National Action Plan, as well as more broadly within 
other sectors, and more strategically across government as 
a whole, particularly through engagement with planning 
and policy making bodies and budget setters.

development planning. Accessed at https://cdkn.org/wp
international-climate-change-commitments-into-national-developmentplanning.pdf2.1 Introduction
As noted in the preceding chapter, Nepal’s NDC draws 
heavily on existing policy and regulation from a range of 
sectors. In this chapter, these policy and regulation are 
presented. This includes a range of specific transport policy 
issued by the federal government over the period 2001-
2014, and associated policy from sectors including:
• Energy policy
• Urban development and local governance policy
• Climate change policy and air quality regulation
• Fiscal and monetary policy
This enables a deeper understanding of the policy roots and 
origins of Nepal’s NDC, as well as indicates the broader 
orientation of the federal government on these topics, 
issues and sectors. For all policy reviewed below, special 
attention is paid to policy provision for electric transport, 
and clean, sustainable transport technologies.
It should be mentioned that in preparation of this chapter, 
a range of policies were reviewed which were not in turn 
presented below. This includes, for example, the National 
Urban Development Strategy or the Environmentally 
Friendly Local Governance Framework and others. Both 
policy initiatives are extremely useful, and both touch upon 
the theme of transportation. However, as the NDC does not 
draw upon them directly, and as they do not contain 
specific provisions for electric mobility, there are not 
presented below.
2.2 Transport Policy and Regulation
The transport sector in Nepal is guided by three main 
policies. These set the overall direction for development of 
the sector, specify goals and targets, outline initiatives and 
principles and demonstrate vision and forward-thinking 
from the government. Each of the three policies are 
explored below.
Name National Transport Policy
Date 
published
2001
Ministry or 
body
Department of Roads
Core policy 
goal
To develop a reliable, cost-effective, safe 
facility-oriented and sustainable 
transport system that promotes and 
sustains economic, social, cultural and 
tourism development in Nepal.
Summary The National Transport Policy is an 
overarching policy aimed at developing
the transport system and improving 
clean transport services (powered by 
gas, electricity and solar).
The policy addresses the development of
sustainable transport infrastructure, 
including infrastructure to connect the 
Strategic Road Network to Local Road 
Networks at the district level. The aim is 
to develop an efficient and effective yy
recognized a key component of this 
effort, driving demand. In addition, the 
policy emphasizes development of the 
East-West Midhills Highway in a 
progressive, planned and systematic 
manner; the construction of roads from
hilly districts to the northern border to 
support market expansion; and 
maintenance of existing transport 
infrastructure based on traffic density 
and a range of economic considerations.
Public transport service provision is also 
key, and the policy focuses on transport 
sustainability through gas and electric 
mobility solutions. It seems to ensure 
that gas and electric public transport 
services are sustainable, safe, reliable, 
comfortable and affordable through the 
introduction of different standards. A 
key issue here is the reduction of 
vehicular greenhouse gas emissions. The 
policy seeks to motivate private sector 
investment in transport, especially in the 
operation of vehicles, and the 
construction and maintenance of 
transport infrastructure. 
Provisions 
for electric 
mobility
The following are specific provisions for 
electric mobility included in the policy:
• Expanding the use of electric 
vehicles, using electricity from 
renewable energy sources.
• Operating electric bus, tram and 
other public transport vehicles, 
especially in cities.
• Planning for an electric rail 
service, utilizing hydropower.

Summary Whereas the National Transport Policy 
underlines the need for clean transport, 
and sets out broad provisions, the 
Environment-Friendly Transport Policy 
sets out more detailed targets and 
directions. The policy discusses overall 
share of electric vehicles in the national 
fleet, transport-related greenhouse gas 
emissions, and explores financing 
options.
The policy adopts the ‘Avoid, Shift and 
Improve Approach’ (ASI Approach), 
encouraging that unnecessary travel is 
avoided, and that trip distance is 
reduced. It promotes a wider shift 
towards more sustainable transport 
modes, especially within the public 
transport system, and also calls for the 
improvement of transport practices and 
technologies to support this. In this 
regard, the policy seeks to diversify 
vehicle technology towards electric, gaspowered and hybrid vehicles. It also 
seeks stricter regulation of vehicle and 
promotes affordable and progressive 
standards for fuel quality. 
Within these areas, the policy sets out 
targets (outlined below). These targets 
provide substantial support to programs 
that aim at strengthening clean transport 
services, specifically electric vehicles.5In 
addition to unlocking opportunities for 
electric vehicle sales and retrofitting 
existing vehicles to become hybrid 
vehicles, this policy and its targets also 
recognize the need to kick-start the 
electric vehicle manufacturing industry 
to increase local job opportunities, 
decrease production costs and 
encourage local resource use.

Transport
Core policy 
goal
To develop a transport system that is 
efficient, accessible, people-centric, 
affordable, reliable, safe, inclusive, 
environmentally-friendly, and resilient.
Summary The National Sustainable Transport 
Strategy sets out a long-term strategic 
vision for the transport sector, and 
provides for a range of sustainable 
transport solutions. The strategy seeks 
to strengthen the economic, social and 
environmental indicators used to guide, 
manage and monitor transport 
, , y 
and social inclusiveness, into relevant 
processes of transport policy 
formulation, plan preparation, 
infrastructure building and transport 
service operation. Such integration 
seeks, ultimately, to lead to the 
development of an improved transport 
system. 
The strategy lays out 19 objectives, 
ranging over the three dimensions of 
sustainability, and provides indicators by 
which to monitor and measure transport 
development. These objectives support 
improved transport performance in 
terms of service operation, maintenance 
of infrastructure and facilities, 
minimization of pollution, ensuring 
sustainable use of natural resources and 
conservation of nature, and ensuring 
social inclusion.
In addition, the National Sustainable 
Transport Strategy streamlines existing 
strategies and guidelines on transport to 
make the sector and its regulatory 
framework more robust. The strategy 
also specifies action necessary for a 
sustainable transport system, and some 
of these strategic actions pertain
specifically to electric vehicles, as 
outlined below.
Provisions 
for electric 
mobility
The following are specific provisions for 
electric mobility included in the policy:
• Promoting electric vehicles across all 
systems.
• Undertaking feasibility studies for 
alternative, electric transport 
initiatives.
• Encouraging the development of a 
high-priority, national electric rail
system.
• Developing required institutional 
structures and support for electric 
mobility.
• Introducing electric bus public 
transportation in urban areasgg gg 
development of hydropower with 
the development of electric mobility 
(vehicles).
• Introducing electric rickshaws in 
small and medium-sized cities.
2.3 Associated Policy, Plans and Regulation
In addition to drawing directly on the transport sector 
policy outlined above, Nepal’s NDC also references and 
indirectly draws support from a range of other policy and 
regulation. These are outlined below, with particular 
attention to the electric mobility provisions of these policy 
and regulation.

The importance of the transport sector in the NDC is due to 
a number of factors, including the dominance of road 
transport, the quality of the transport stock, the terrain of 
the country, the structure of urbanization in Nepal, the 
capacity for public transport provision and the structure of 
fuel and energy sources. These various factors are explored 
below. 
This chapter is intended to provide critical background and 
contextual information, and to set the scene for a closer 
examination of the NDC and its transport targets (Chapter 
1). It also allows for the contextualization of the policy and 
regulation upon which the NDC was built (Chapter 2). 
3.2 Vehicles and the Motorization of Nepal
Road transport is the dominant mode of transport in Nepal, 
accounting for over 90% of the domestic movement of 
passengers and goods.7In addition, there is one 
international airport currently, in Kathmandu, with two 
further under construction, namely in Pokhara and Lumbini. 
There are also some 30 airports capable of domestic 
commercial air traffic. The share of movement by air is 
increasing. As a landlocked country, there are no ports and 
while some transport of goods takes place via the country’s 
many waterways, it is extremely limited. As a result, this

National Action Plan focuses on road transport and the 
term ‘transport’ is used in this report to mean transport by 
road, unless explicitly stated otherwise. 
Nepal’s road network is categorized as a) highways and 
feeder roads, constituting the Strategic Road Network; and 
b) local, agricultural and minor roads, constituting the Local 
Road Network. In 2016/17 the total road network 
comprised of 29,157 km that included both road networks. 
Out of this 12,305 km has been paved, 6865 is graveled and 
9987 km is in earthen condition.
8 Due to a largely hilly and 
mountainous terrain, especially in the north, road projects 
tend to be expensive, and require frequent maintenance. 
The southern lowland terai area is flatter, and as result 
holds over 60% of the country’s road network.9 The 
Department of Roads is responsible for the Strategic Road 
Network, and the Department of Local Infrastructure and 
Agriculture Roads is responsible for the local network. 
Investment by the government in roads is significant and 
ongoing, though work remains. The last remaining district 
headquarters not connected to the Strategic Road Network, 
are expected to be integrated into the network in late 
2017, and mid-2018 respectively. At this point, the longheld policy goal of the Department of Roads (per National 
Transport Policy), that all citizens be at maximum a four 
hour walk from a strategic road, will have been achieved.

Total roads (Km)As Nepal develops, demand for vehicles is growing, fueled 
by urbanization and higher incomes. During 1990-2015, the 
number of total vehicles registered annually grew by 14% 
per year (see Figure 3.1). Within this, during 1990-2014, the 
number of registered personal cars grew at 11%; the 
number of two wheelers grew at 12%.10 By 2016, there 
were a total of 2,339,169 vehicles registered in Nepal. A 
major share of these vehicles is concentrated in and around 
Kathmandu. The wider Bagmati Zone, which contains the 
linked cities of Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, accounts 
for 43% of total vehicles registered in Nepal
Overall growth in motorization masks shifts in modal share. 
An overwhelming majority of registered vehicles are two 
wheelers. Modal share for two wheelers has risen from 
55% in 1991, to over 80% in 2014. Affordability and the 
capacity of two wheelers to cut through congested city 
streets are two primary factors driving this dominance. The 
number of buses rose from 4000 units in 1990, to more 
than 35,000 units in 2015. This category includes full size 
buses, minibuses, microbuses and three-wheeler 
microbuses, called tempos. However, as a share of the total 
vehicle fleet, buses have declined from 11% of the total in 
1990, to only 3% in 2015.11
With such highly concentrated motorization, insufficient 
investment in road and highway networks, and weak public 
transport systems, congestion is common in Nepal’s larger 
cities. Additional challenges linked to poorly managed road 
transport including low urban air quality and associated 
public health costs. 
Increasing road networks has been known to positively 
correlate with the increase in transport services in the 
country. A steady growth in road connectivity has been 
observed, by about 5% AAGR during 1990-2016. This 
growth has supported increase in vehicles accessing areas 
that were previously thought to be unimaginable due to the 
difficult terrain. Currently, the road network reaches 73 out 
of the 75 districts of Nepal. This increase in the road 
network and consequently, vehicles covering larger 
distances has also been known to increase transport sector 
emissions in the country.

Commission for Asia and the Pacific. 4.1 Introduction
As explored in Part 1, a number of policies and initiatives 
for sustainable transport are now in place at the national 
level. Fundamentally, these policies respond to a) sustained 
deterioration of air quality in cities; b) suboptimal transport 
systems and congestion; c) economic risk and vulnerability 
due to energy insecurity; and d) concern over greenhouse 
gas emissions. When viewed relative to other emitters, 
Nepal’s greenhouse gas emission is minor, constituting 
some 0.027% of global emissions12. Concern over air quality 
is more acute. Ambient air pollution in Kathmandu, for 
example, far exceeds the level stipulated by the World 
Health Organization. Indeed, in 2017, the city had some of 
most polluted urban air in Asia.
13
In Part 2 of this report, an analysis of recent, current and 
projected future greenhouse gas emissions is undertaken. 
An initial baseline study of greenhouse gas emissions in any 
country is important in determining the country’s emissions 
pathway, prioritizing sectors where interventions are 
required and designing, as well as implementing, mitigation 
activities to address critical emissions areas. This is the aim 
of Chapter 4. Much of the analysis will draw off Nepal’s 
Initial National Communication and Second National 
Communication, as well as more recent academic work and 
climate modelling. These two communications were 
submitted by the Government of Nepal to the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC) in 2004 and 2014 respectively. These are the only

national records of national greenhouse gas inventories. 
Additional data from the World Resources Institute and the 
World Bank will also be utilized in this chapter. Attention 
will also be paid to particulate matter and local air 
pollutants.
This chapter focuses on the time period 1995-2015. As 
such, it looks backward at emissions across multiple 
sectors, with special focus on the transport sector. In 
Chapter 5, future projected emissions for the transport 
sector are presented using a base year of 2005, and 
projecting forward to 2030, and 2050 under different 
scenarios.
4.2 Energy Sources and Consumption
Energy is derived from a range of sources in Nepal, 
including traditional, commercial and alternative sources. A 
review and summary of energy supply and consumption 
follows:
Overall energy demand is rising, across all sectors. The 
energy demand of the country has been estimated to grow 
at an annual average growth rate of 3% during 1995-2015. 
Over this period, the highest annual growth in energy 
consumption was observed in the agriculture sector (21%) 
followed by the industrial sector (9%), transport sector 
(7%), commercial sector (6%) and residential sector (2%).14

Secretariat, Government of Nepal.; IEA. 2017. Energy Balances. Accessed

https://www.iea.org/statistics/statisticssearch/report/?country=NEPAL&pggy 
residential sector within the country. Around 77% of the 
energy consumed in the residential sector of Nepal is being 
supplied by biomass.15 Biomass in Nepal includes fuel 
wood, agriculture residue and animal dung. 
Dependence on imported fossil fuel is rising. Nepal’s 
reliance on fossil fuel imports has been growing at an 
average annual growth rate (AAGR) of 8% since 1993.16 The 
price of petroleum imports increased by 38.3% between 
2071/72 (2014/15) and 2072/73 (2015/16), and the 
revenue collected from total sales rose by 30% in the same 
time. This reliance is expected to decrease as the country 
realizes its tremendous hydropower potential, currently 
estimated at 43,000 MW, due to which demand-side fuel 
diversification will be possible.
py 
Non-renewable energy demand from the transport sector 
is highest of all sectors. The residential sector consumes 
the highest share of energy, followed by the transport and 
Industrial sectors. However, because the residential sector 
consumes primarily biomass, a renewable energy source, in 
terms of fossil fuel consumption the transport sector leads. 
The share of cumulative transport sector energy demand of
the total energy demand, excluding residential sector 
demand, is 43% during 1995-2015. This is outlined in Figure 
4.1 below.

Energy consumption (GJ)
Industrial Commercial Transport Agriculture OtherWithin this context, it is clear that energy consumption in 
Nepal has risen substantially as economic activities have 
increased. This is leading to a corresponding rise in 
greenhouse gas and local pollutant emissions. However, 
monitoring of both emissions types (greenhouse gas and 
local pollutants) remains limited.
In an attempt to address this, in terms of local pollutants, 
the Department of Environment, with support from the 
International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development 
(ICIMOD), have recently installed air pollution monitoring 
stations in 12 sites across Nepal. There are further plans to 
expand the number of sites to 50. In addition, the US 
government has installed two monitoring stations in 
Kathmandu Valley. 
In-terms of greenhouse gas emissions, the Initial National 
Communication and the Second National Communication
are the only inventories available. Nepal’s first efforts at 
assembling a greenhouse gas inventory was published in 
1997, using data from the 1990/91. This was a preliminary 
attempt at assessing GHG emissions from a very limited set 
of sectors namely, fuel combustion, agriculture and 
biomass burning. This was taken as one of the references 
for estimating the country’s greenhouse gas inventory, with 
base year 1994/95, in the Initial National Communication, 
which was submitted to the UNFCCC in 2000. In 2014, 
Nepal completed its Second National Communication, using 
2000-2001 as the base year. This communication was 
submitted and accepted by the UNFCCC, in compliance with 
Nepal’s international commitments in 2015. In 2017, Nepal 
began the process of assembling its Third National 
Communication, though findings and data from this process 
have not been released (as at December 2017). As such, the 
greenhouse gas inventory set out in the Second National 
Communication constitutes the most up-to-date national 
inventory available. 
In the Initial National Communication, the Revised 1996 
Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories from 
the International Panel on Climate Change (PICC) and 
default emission factors recommended by the IPCC were 
utilized. The Long-Range Energy Alternatives Planning 
(LEAP) model was utilized to analyze projections of energy 
demands, greenhouse gas emissions and other components 
in the residential and transport sectors. Since the 
commercial sector’s emissions were negligible, this sector 
 
18 Ministry of Population and Environment. 2004. Initial National 
Communication to the Conference of the Parties of the United Nations 
y
accurate data, such as the energy efficiency of different 
technologies, for optimal use of the LEAP model. Instead, a 
simpler model has been used to estimate emissions from 
the industrial sector.18 Similarly, the Second National 
Communication also used the Revised 1996, including the 
IPCC’s Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty 
Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and 
Good Practice Guidance for Land-Use, Land-Use Change and 
Forestry (LULUCF) to estimate the emissions for the base 
year 2000.19
It should be noted that there are discrepancies between 
agriculture sector and LULUCF emissions inventory 
presented in the Initial and Second National 
Communications mainly due to differences in 
methodologies and associated emissions factors used. 
There is a large disparity between emissions from the 
LULUCF sector in 1994 and 2000, particularly because of 
the higher default growth rate used for the forestry sector 
along with the lower grassland conversion rate used in the 
SNC estimates, compared to the INC estimates. The 2000 
and 2008 inventory values are in line as the same emissions 
factors were used to estimate emissions in both years. 
The Second National Communication includes estimates 
emissions for CO2, methane (CH4), NOx, CO, non-methane 
volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) and sulfur oxide (SO)
from fossil fuel combustion in the transport, industrial, 
commercial, residential and agriculture sectors. Biomass is 
classified as a renewable energy due to which CO2
emissions from biomass are not included in the inventory. 
However, due to local pollutant emission from biomass 
burning, it has been observed to have substantial negative 
effect on the human health, ecosystems and the 
environment. In addition, in both the national 
communications, emissions from combustion of both 
stationary and mobile fossil fuel sources are included in the 
energy emissions. The stationary sources are energy 
industries, residential, commercial and agriculture sources, 
whereas mobile sources include road transport, civil 
aviation and railways. 
19 Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment. 2014. Second 
National Communication to United Nations Framework Convention on Following a review of both national communications, as 
well as additional international data, four key findings 
emerge as outlined below:
National greenhouse gas emissions are rising, driven 
mainly by fossil fuel consumption in the energy-using 
sectors. Nepal emitted 21,810 Gg of CO2 equivalent 
(excluding LULUCF) and 9035 Gg CO2e (including LULUCF) in 
, 
due to the fact that LULUCF emissions are driven by
biomass consumption.21 As can be seen in Figure 4.2, 
emissions from waste and industrial processes were 
significantly lower than the energy and agriculture related 
emissions during the period of 1994-2008.

MtCO2e Electricity/Heat Manufacturing/Construction Other Fuel Combustion Fugitive Emissions TransportationOverall, GHG emissions from the energy sector increased by 
a CAGR of approximately 5% during 1994-2014. This 
increase was primarily due to an increase in economic 
activities that led to increasing energy consumption in the 
residential, transport and energy-intensive industrial 
sectors. The Second National Communication also presents 
the 2008 GHG emissions inventory, which shows an 
increase of 2% in the GHG emissions, when compared to 
those of 2000. Although the industrial processes emission 
was 2% of the total emissions in 2008, highest growth in 
emissions, at a CAGR of 19%, was estimated from this 
sector during 1994-2014. Growth across all sectors can be 
seen in Figure 4.2
Economic activity has a major influence on change in 
energy emissions of the country. Figure 4.3 shows the 
trend in increase in emissions from the energy using sectors 
of Nepal. Steady growth at AAGR 3% has been observed for 
the period 1995-2008. 
A spike in emissions in 1999 may have been a result of sixfold increase in the quantity of diesel consumed in the 
agriculture sector25. Economic activity in 1999 was also 
observed to have increased, when compared to 1998: a 
6.4% increase in GDP, with growth in the agriculture sector 
by 5% and non-agriculture sector by 7.4%. As a result, the 
growth in energy demand increased by 5% in 1999, 
compared to only 3% in 1998, with the most noticeable 
increase by 109% and 318% observed in the industrial 
sector and agriculture sector energy consumption, 
respectively.
The dip in GHG emissions subsequently (i.e., in 2000) may 
have been the result of the decrease in economic activity 
that yea. The GDP growth rate was 5.8% with the 
agriculture output growth of only 4% and non-agricultural 
output growth by 6.9%, lower than the productivity in the 
previous year.26 Decline in the overall GHG emissions in 
2004 may have also been a result of the decrease in energy 
consumption in the industrial sector in the same year.

from the World Resources Institute27 is presented in Figure 
4.4. The share of emission from “other fuel combustion” 
shown in Figure 4.4, is mainly from biomass in the 
residential sector. When fuel combustion from the 
residential sector is excluded, the share of cumulative 
transport sector emission is highest, at 57%, followed by 
industrial sector (42%) emissions during 1994-2014. The 
transport sector emissions have been observed to grow at 
an AAGR of 9% during 1994-2014. 
In addition to carbon dioxide emissions, the GHG 
inventories quantify emissions of methane and nitrous 
oxide. However, the transport sector has no role in 
emission of methane and nitrous oxide. Figure 4.4 shows 
that the transport component is the leading contributor of 
carbon dioxide emissions within the energy sector, 
contributing some 7% of total carbon dioxide emissions, 
excluding LULUCF, across all sectors in 2014.
Urban air is increasingly polluted. Air quality in especially 
larger cities in Nepal has fallen sharply, as concentrations of 
pollutants rise. In Kathmandu, exposure to fine particulate 
matter (PM2.5) as per the Environmental Performance 
Index was 30.40 µg/m3in 2014, three times higher than the 
World Health Organization standard of 10 µg/m3.
28 This 
level of exposure is more than four times higher than the 
average level across low-income countries (7.17 μg/m3) and 
3.5 times higher than that of lower middle-income 
countries (8.54 μg/m3). In 2016, only the rapidly developing 
and industrialising economies of China, India and 
Bangladesh performed worse than Nepal in this indicator.
In 2016, the annual average exposure of PM 2.5 in 
Kathmandu Valley was nearly five times higher than the 
WHO standard29 , and more than four times higher than in 
the entire country.30 The concentration has almost doubled 
within the past three decades. Satellite images taken 
between 2012 and 2014 show that Nepal is among the 
countries with the highest PM 2.5 concentrations in Asia.Nepal has experienced changes in temperature and 
mean precipitation. The country, with the exception of 
some isolated pockets, has become warmer. Data on 
temperature trends from 1975 to 2005 showed 0.060C 
rise in temperature annually whereas mean rainfall has 
significantly decreased on an average of 3.7 mm (-3.2%) 
per month per decade. Under various climate change 
scenarios for Nepal, mean annual temperatures are 
projected to increase between 1.3-3.8°C by the 2060s 
and 1.8-5.8°C by the 2090s. Annual precipitation 
reduction is projected to be in a range of 10 to 20 % 
across the country.
In Nepal’s Himalaya, the total estimated ice reserve 
between 1977 and 2010 has decreased by 29% (129 
km3). The number of glacier lakes has increased by 11% 
and glaciers recede on an average by 38 km2 per year. 
Hence, climate change has visible and pronounced 
impacts on snows and glaciers that are likely to increase 
the glacier lake outburst floods. Nepal has suffered from 
increased frequency of extreme weather events such as 
landslides, floods and droughts resulting to the loss of
human lives as well as high social and economic costs.
The 2013 study titled Economic Assessment of Climate 
Change in Key Sectors (agriculture, hydropower and 
water-induced disasters) has estimated direct cost of 
current climate variability and extreme events 
equivalent to 1.5 to 2 percent of current GDP/year 
(approximately USD 270-360 million/year in 2013 prices) 
and much higher in extreme years. In the case of 
hydropower, the model projected lower dry season 
flows and thus lower energy availability. The additional 
energy generation capacity needed to meet future 
demand under this scenario, due to climate change, was 
estimated at 2800 MW by 2050 with an increase in costs 
of USD 2.6 billion (present value) for the period through 
to 2050. Overall, the economic costs of climate change in 
Nepal for these three sectors could be equivalent to 2-
3% of current GDP/year by mid-century.

The following section reviews greenhouse gas and local 
pollutant emissions exclusively from the transport sector. 
For this, the analysis draws on similar data sources to the 
preceding section. Key findings are as follows below.
The transport sector has the highest share in energy 
emissions in the country. As seen in the previous section, 
the share of transport sector emissions in the cumulative 
emissions of the energy-using sector is highest, when 
compared with the other sectors.32
There are two types of transport services mainly being used 
in Nepal: road transport and civil aviation. Of these two, the 
former dominates the sector as 90% of all passenger and 
freight movement within the country is carried out through 
road transport. According to a report prepared by the Task 
Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, GHG emissions 
(from the transport sector) due to fuel combustion include 
carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide 
(N2O), and pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), nonmethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), sulfur 
dioxide (SO2), particular matter (PM) and oxides of nitrate 
(NOx).
33 Figure 4.5 below shows the trend in emissions from 
the transport sector in Nepal. The emissions from the 
transport sector has grown at an AAGR of 10% during 1995-
2013. Growth in population, demand for vehicles and a 
consequent rise in demand of fossil fuels for the vehicle fleet 
along with change in economic activities, all play a major role 
in influencing transport sector emissions. 
Significant growth in transport sector emissions can be 
observed after 2007. Transport sector emissions during 
1997-2007 was relatively stable increasing by only an AAGR 
of 0.82% during that period. Such a low level was possibly 
linked to political and economic instability during the 
decade-long insurgency. However, after 2007, transport 
sector emissions increased at an AAGR of 22% during 2007-
2013 (see Figure 4.5).
Transport sector emissions have been driven largely by 
passenger vehicles in Kathmandu. As ownership of private 
vehicles increase, emissions from the transport sector is 
rising (see Chapter 3 for a detailed discussion on vehicle

public vehicles, particularly large buses, have increased 
from around 6000 in 1990 to 51,000 in 2015, its share in 
the total vehicle fleet has been estimated to decrease from 
3% in 1990 to 1% in 2014 (see Chapter 3). 
As outlined in Part 1 of this report, although consumption 
of petroleum products in the transport sector has increased 
by an AAGR of 9%, CO2 emissions from the sector increased 
by an AAGR of 11% during 1994-2013 (see Figure 4.5). This 
is mainly because of the rise in transport vehicles, 
particularly private vehicles, at 14% per annum in the
period 1990-2015.

Valley. The list of sources includes rapid motorisation (12% 
annual growth over the past ten years) combined with 
limited public transport system (with only private 
operators); valley-centric industrialisation (industrial 
activities are mostly centred in Bara and Kathmandu 
Valley); Nepal`s topography (restricting wind movement 
and retaining the pollutants in the atmosphere), resuspension of dust (from poor or un-surfaced roads), as 
well as the widespread use of diesel generators for 
electricity generation.34 During periods of load shedding, 
diesel generators are used extensively for back-up 
electricity supply. Estimates suggest that air quality in larger 
Nepali cities can drop by as much as 40% as a result.

sector has increased significantly (by a CAGR of 5.4%), 
followed by CO emissions which increased by a CAGR of

The rise in local pollutant concentrations negatively impact 
human health. Overall, almost 75% of the Nepali population

In 2013, more than 9,000 deaths in Nepal were attributed 
to air pollution.40 In that same year, air pollution-induced 
loss of welfare was recorded at 2.8 billion USD, which is 
equivalent to nearly 5% of the country’s GDP. This is 
equivalent to approximately 40% of the losses and damages 
caused by the 2015 earthquake, estimated at 7 billion 
USD.41 It is, however, important to note that the economic 
losses due to air pollution occur annually. The projected 
increase of PM 2.5 will have a substantial effect on the 
economy, i.e. healthcare cost will increase, lost working

Local pollutant emission (Gg)
NMVOC CO Nox PM10 SO25.1 Introduction
Many of the transport sector trends identified in Chapter 4, 
including energy consumption, energy dependency and 
mix, greenhouse gas emissions, and local pollutant 
emissions, are expected to continue for many years, if not 
decades. How these trends evolve, and the degrees of 
fluctuation they demonstrate, will be influenced by a range 
of factors, including economic, policy, social and 
infrastructural decisions. The subject of chapter 5 is to 
explore these trends in more detail under projections and 
scenarios through to 2030 and 2050.
This will draw upon a composition of academic and 
technical articles published on the subject using both LEAP
and MARKAL models.43 In particular, the chapter draws on 
analysis undertaken by Shakya and Shrestha and published 
in 2011.44 This paper identifies the electrification of the 
transport sector as a critical strategic option in Nepal which 
has several co-benefits. These co-benefits range from 
increasing energy security to reduced greenhouse gas 
emissions as well as reduced local pollutant emissions. The 
study analyzes demand estimates from 2005 (as base year) 
to 2050.

45 Some of the key assumptions outlined by Shakya and Shrestha for the 
BAU scenario are related to GDP growth rate of 5.5% during 2010-2015, 
This chapter starts with a discussion of projected energy 
consumptions and emissions through to 2030 and 2050, 
assuming that current energy use, industry conditions, 
population growth and other factors remain the same. This 
is known as business as usual (BAU). The chapter then 
explores three alternative scenarios for consumption and 
emissions through to 2030 and 2050 that each introduce 
different mixes of electric mobility into the projections. By 
reviewing and presenting these alternative scenarios to 
current business as usual, this chapter provides options in 
support of the targets set for the transport sector in Nepal’s 
NDC.
5.2 National Transport Sector in the Business as 
Usual Scenario 
The BAU scenario presented in the Shakya and Shrestha 
paper is summarized below to show changes in fossil fuel 
consumption, energy security, greenhouse gas and local 
pollutant emissions, along with electricity generation 
during 2005-2050.45 The paper uses MARKAL to model the 
analysis and present projections. The model considers 
2020-2050. In addition, urban population is estimated to increase from 
16.7 to 55.6% and household electrification is estimated to increase from 
40-100% during 2005-2030. The study also assumes that the import of 
electricity will stay at 150 MW beyond 2020 and that the export of 
electricity will grow up to 2091 MW, anticipating addition of West Seti, 
Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower plants onto the grid. Further to 
considering 70 candidate hydropower plants, the study also considers 
alternate power generation technologies such as diesel power plant,
wood-based gasification combined cycle power plants and landfill gasbased power plant. ppy y p
options along with bus, micro-bus, car, two-wheelers (twowheelers), three-wheelers (autorickshaws or tuk-tuks) and 
taxis as road transport options. The freight transport 
options include railway and ropeway as mass transport 
options and truck, tractor and pick-up as road transport 
options. 
Primary Energy Supply Mix and Final Energy Consumption 
Under the BAU scenario hydropower generation is 
estimated to increase by 12 times, whereas biomass use is 
estimated to decrease by 18% during 2005-2050. 
Congruent with that trend, the share of hydropower in the 
total electricity mix is estimated to increase from 82% in
2005 to 89% in 2050, which is a 14-fold production capacity 
increase. The study shows that the share of thermal power 
plant capacity is replaced by hydropower and other 
renewables (micro-hydro, solar home systems, 
cogeneration, and so forth). 
The increase in final energy consumption, when biomass is 
excluded (consistent with analysis under the Second 
National Communication, presented in the preceding 
chapter), is highest for the transport sector, followed by the 
residential sector, in 2030 and 2050 (see Figure 5.1). The 
transport sector’s final energy consumption is highest 
compared to the other sectors and is estimated to increase 
by a CAGR of 7% and 6% in 2030 and 2050 respectively, 
compared to the base year (i.e., 2005). The total final 
energy consumption is estimated to increase by a CAGR of 
6% in 2030 and 5% in 2050, compared to that in 2005.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
In the base case (which is effectively the BAU), the total 
greenhouse gas emissions in Nepal are estimated to have 
grown two- fold by 2030 and five-fold by 2050, compared 
p
39% in 2030 and 2050, respectively. As the transport sector 
is estimated to consume around 43% of the imported 
petroleum in 2050, its share of emissions in the same year 
is also estimated to be higher than the other sectors’ 
emissions. 
Local Pollutant Emissions 
Under business as usual, the share of CO emissions has 
decreased from 82% in 2005, to 76% in 2050 (see Figure 
5.3). The share of PM10 emissions in Nepal is estimated to 
increase from 2% in 2005 to 4% in 2050 mainly due to an 
increase in the share of fossil fuel transport services in the 
country (see Figure 5.1). The highest and lowest increase in 
emissions has been estimated for nitrous oxides (NOx by 
262%) and non-methane volatile organic compounds
(NMVOC by 28%). 
Energy Security 
Three indicators were used to assess changes in energy 
security in the business as usual scenario. The ShannonWiener Index46, a well-used indicator of energy security, 
shows that under business as usual, the level of 
diversification in energy resource mix will increase between 
2005 and 2050. This is primarily due to the energy mix 
shifting from a predominantly biomass-based system to 
hydropower, fossil-fuel and alternative energy. However, 
results for the second indicator, the Net Energy Import 
Ratio (NEIR %), and the third indicator, simply per capita oil 
consumption (kgoe/capita), are both seen to increase, 
indicating the country is becoming more fossil-fuel 
intensive. With increasing dependency on neighboring 
countries for fossil fuel imports, it can be inferred from the 
study that the energy security of the country would 
therefore decrease in the BAU scenario.

of diversification, lowest value is 0 which shows that there is no Figure 5.1. Final energy consumption during 2005-2050.47

5.3 Scenarios for Electric Mobility Electrification 
of the National Transport Sector 
Shakya and Shrestha’s analysis discusses five alternate 
scenarios pertaining to transport electrification in Nepal. Of 
the five scenarios, only the three scenarios most closely 
aligned to the NDC targets are presented in this chapter 
(see also Table 5.1 below). Each scenario offers a different 
mix of electric transport, as follows:
• EMT30 – Under this scenario, 10% of total 
transport demand would be met by electric mass 
transport in 2020, rising to 30% by 2050
• EMT20 + EV10 – Under this scenario, 20% of total 
transport demand would be met by electric mass 
transport in 2015, remaining at that level through 
to 2050; and 10% of total transport demand would 
be met through electric passenger vehicles by 
2015, remaining at that level through to 2050.
• EMT30 + EV15 - Under this scenario, 20% of total 
transport demand would be met by electric mass 
transport in 2015, remaining at that level through 
to 2050; and 10% of total transport demand would 
be met through electric passenger vehicles by 
2015, rising to 15% by 2050.
These three scenarios are presented in table 5.1 below.

Primary Energy Supply Mix and Final Energy Consumption
The scenarios presented above have different implications 
on the type and quantity of energy consumed. Since EMT30 
is focused solely on mass transport systems, such as 
passenger and freight railway, its energy demand will be 
different to the EMT20+EV10 scenario in which the share of 
electric mass transport system is less, with an additional 
share of road electric vehicles. Similarly, the energy 
demand in EMT20+EV15 scenario will be different.
Cumulative primary energy supply has been estimated to 
decrease in all three scenarios. Under EMT30, it decreases 
by 0.92%, and under EMT20+EV15 it decreases by 2.74% 
compared to BAU. The share of hydropower in cumulative 
primary energy supply is highest in the EMT20+EV15 
scenario, where it reaches 15%, followed by 14% in both 
EMT30 and EMT20+EV10 scenarios. Similarly, the 
cumulative petroleum product demand is estimated to 
decrease by 12% in EMT30 and by 14.7% in EMT20+EV15, 
compared to BAU.
Final energy consumption in the transport sector, in 2030 
and 2050, is shown in Figure 5.4 below. The highest 
decrease in transport sector final energy consumption is 
estimated at 19% under EMT30, followed by a 16% 
decrease under EMT20+EV15 and a 14% decrease under 
EMT20+EV10 scenarios, when compared to BAU. It is 
important to note that electrification of mass transport 
systems (i.e., the introduction of electric train, ropeway, 
etc. such as in the EMT30 scenario) will produce the 
greatest reduction in final energy consumption. 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
The greenhouse gas emissions (see Figure 5.5) are 
projected to decrease against BAU accordingly. A reduction 
of 9% under EMT20+EV10 is estimated, with an even 
greater reduction of 13% under EMT20+EV15. Greenhouse 
gas emissions under EMT20+EV10 are 2% higher than 
under EMT30 and 5% higher than under EMT20+EV15. This 
shows that mass transportation plays a very significant role 
in decreasing GHG emissions in the country and is 
congruent with the anticipated reduction in final energy 
consumption which mass transport delivers (see above).
g
EMT20+EV15, compared to that in the BAU in 2050. 
Although as discussed in the previous section, an increase 
in the final energy consumption in this scenario (i.e., 
EMT30+EV10) is estimated, the higher decrease in GHG 
emissions in the same scenario can be attributed to 
increasing electrification of the transport sector.
Local Pollutant Emissions 
Cumulative local pollutant emissions, are estimated to 
decrease under the different scenarios when compared 
against BAU (see Table 5.2). The cumulative emission of CO 
has been estimated to decrease by 5.7% in EMT30 and 
9.9% in EMT20+EV15 against the BAU. Similarly, the 
cumulative emission of NOx is estimated to decrease by 
8.5% under EMT30, and by 10.9% under EMT20+EV15. The 
other local pollutant emissions follow a similar trend. 
Conversely, cumulative PM10 emissions increased by 1% 
under EMT30 and decreased by 6.9% under EMT20+EV15, 
compared to the BAU. Besides PM10 emissions in the 
EMT30 scenario, local pollutant levels have been estimated 
to decrease proportional to increasing transport 
electrification targets. 
Energy Security 
Projections for annual fossil fuel imports, as a percentage of 
the total annual primary energy supply, as well per capita 
oil consumption, have been seen to decrease under all 
three scenarios, compared to BAU. This is outlined in Table 
5.3. The Shannon-Wiener Index shows that the energy 
resource mix of the country will diversify to include more 
resources in the primary energy supply mix. Cumulative 
energy imports during the period 2005-2050 are estimated 
to decrease under all three scenarios, when compared to 
BAU. Of the total oil imports, the transport sector is 
estimated to consume the lowest share (84.4%) under the 
EMT20+EV15 and the highest share (91.9%) under the 
EMT20+EV10.
All three indicators presented show that increasing 
transport electrification causes a reduction in fossil fuel 
imports. This has a significant positive impact on increasing 
energy security in Nepal. Figure 5.4. Final energy consumption in the transport sector in 2030 and 2050 (Mtoe).

Box 5.1. Increasing adoption of electric motorbikes in Kathmandu 
A recent study on the road transport energy demand and its implication on emissions in Kathmandu Valley 
was carried out by Bajracharya and Bhattarai in 2016. This study uses the Long-range Energy Alternative 
Planning System (LEAP) model to analyze different transport policies in Nepal, and explore their impact.
More than 65% of the total vehicles registered in Nepal reside in Kathmandu Valley, and two-wheelers 
make up 80% of the vehicles in the city. Since the contribution of two-wheelers to greenhouse gas and local 
pollutant emissions is high, this study puts forward a strong case for assessing the impact of greatly 
increasing the share of electric two-wheelers in in Kathmandu Valley. Under this scenario, the authors of 
the study modelled an increase in the sale of electric two-wheelers, which rose from 1% in 2016 to 75% in 
2030. The base year, in this study, is 2010.
This scenario generated a number of positive effects. In the BAU of this study, two-wheelers constituted 
39% of total energy demand in Kathmandu Valley by 2030. However, a shift to electric two-wheelers would 
see this demand reduce by 12%. This would also deliver a saving, due to reduced fossil fuel imports, of NPR 
52,576 (USD 496 million). 48 During the same period, cumulative GHG emissions would by 7% and local 
pollutant emissions for CO, hydro-carbon (HC), NOx and PM10, would decrease by 25%, 29%, 7% and 20% 
respectively. 
The study indicates that policy measures to increase the share of electric two-wheelers should be adopted 
due to the numerous advantages outlined above.
 Box 5.2. Power generation capacity requirements during 2005-2050.
With increasing electrification of the transport sector comes increased electricity consumption, leading to 
increased demand long-term. To be effective, electric mobility initiatives must therefore be supported 
though increased investment in hydropower and other forms of renewable electricity generation.
Power generation requirements under the three scenarios were calculated by Shresthra and Shakya (2011). 
Overall power generation capacity requirements increase by a CAGR of 2% under all scenarios, except under 
EMT20+10 where it is estimated to increase by a CAGR of 3% during 2030-2050. In particular, in terms of 
hydropower specifically, in order to accommodate a rise in demand, hydropower generation would need to 
increase by 5% under EMT30 to as much as by 12% under EMT20+EV15 compared to BAU generation.

5.4 Electrification Scenarios and Implications for 
Achieving NDCs
As a whole, the scenarios presented above demonstrate 
that gradual and increased uptake of electric vehicles, and 
wider systemic shifts towards electric mobility systems, 
have substantial benefits for the country, and directly 
support the achievement of the NDC transport sector 
targets. These benefits are political, financial, economic, 
strategic, social and environmental. Key implications from 
the review of scenarios are outlined below:
• Policy interventions today deliver substantial 
long-term dividends in terms of meeting NDC 
targets – To tackle rising emissions (greenhouse 
gas and local pollutant) along with rising fossil fuel 
consumption in the transport sector in Nepal, it is 
essential to recognize and implement robust policy 
interventions today, to reap benefits of emissions 
and fossil fuel reductions in the future, supporting 
achievement of the transport sector NDC targets.
• Even moderate increases in share of electric 
vehicles and electric mobility systems deliver

addition to these direct benefits, there are 
numerous co-benefits such as increased energy 
security, with increasing diversification and use of 
local energy resources, and decreased local 
pollutant emissions, that can contribute towards 
meeting not only the four transport-related 
targets set in the NDC, but also the broader goals 
of sustainable development. 
• Increased electric mobility will reduce fossil fuel 
consumption in the country - All three scenarios 
discussed above show that with realistic targets 
for transport sector electrification, significant 
advances in reducing dependency on fossil fuels in 
the transport can be made. As can be seen in 
Figure 5.7, the decrease in fossil fuel consumption 
in the three scenarios will, in themselves, deliver 
between 15% - 19% of the total dependence 
y gy 
support strategic goals for hydropower 
generation - Since 95% of electricity requirements 
are met through hydropower generation in Nepal, 
electrification of the transport sector has high 
implications on hydropower capacity in the 
country. Thus, it is essential to align transport 
electrification targets with hydropower generation 
targets. 
• Significant improvements in urban air quality can 
be achieved through increased electric mobility – 
The scenarios explored in this chapter also achieve 
an overall reduction in local air pollutants. This in 
itself leads to improved public health, reduced 
fatalities and high degrees of productivity, as well 
as delivering wider economic benefits (for example 
tourism).

Part 3 reviews the current context in Nepal and identifies 
critical barriers that inhibit greater penetration of electric

identification are based on comprehensive stakeholder 
consultations, as laid out in Figure 6.1 below. Through 
these consultations, barriers were identified, graded, 
ordered and prioritized. In particular, the Ministries of 
Forests and Environment, and of Physical Infrastructure and 
Transport provided essential direction with prioritization.

Policy and governance barriers and issues are presented in 
Figure 7.1 below.
Figure 7.1. Overview of barriers and issuesThe following are the specific policy and governance 
barriers to greater adoption of electric vehicles in Nepal.
Barrier 1. Limited Operational Action 
While the government has published a range of high-level 
policy that support electric mobility, much of this policy 
requires operationalization. Policy reflects what a ministry 
hopes to achieve, but typically policy is not legally binding. 
Nor does policy provide specific instruction, lay out 
principles of operation and set standards. As such, an 
absence of directives, programs, standards and legislation 
for electric mobility currently inhibits the achievement of 
policy. The main exception to this general barrier is within 
the fiscal space, where revision to the customs and value 
added taxes regulation has been undertaken to favor 
electric vehicles.
ISSUE ABSENCE OF DIRECTIVES AND LEGISLATION 
FOR ELECTRIC MOBILITY
Number 1.1
Category Policy and regulation
Summary The Environment Friendly Transport Policy
and the National Sustainable Transport 
Strategy both set provisions and targets for 
electric vehicles, some of which were taken 
up in the Nationally Determined 
Contributions. However, there has been no 
subsequent action from government setting 
out directives, instructions or procedures 
for implementation of these policy. 
Importantly, supportive legislation has not 
been formulated. As such, while top-level 
policy is in place, reflecting high-level 
aspirations, the absence of operationallevel work is a fundamental issue. 
Legislation is needed that empowers police 
and traffic offers to fine heavily and clearly 
polluting vehicles. Currently no such 
legislation exists (see Issue 13.4 on police 
capacity).
Result Policy remains unimplemented; 
responsibilities and obligations for electric 
mobility are not set out; lack of executional 
clarity
Action See Priority Action 1 overall, as well as 
Initiative 1, Initiative 2, and Initiative 3
Category Planning
Summary As for Issue 1.1 above, while there is a 
range of policy in place, these have not 
been operationalized into a focused, 
practical electric mobility plan. Such a plan 
needs to lay out specific programs and 
initiatives, including any required subsidy or 
schemes, and provide clear action for 
implementation of policy goals and targets. 
Result Policy remains unimplemented; absence of 
clear road map for action
Action See Priority Action 1
ISSUE ABSENCE OF PROGRAMS TO 
OPERATIONALIZE POLICY AND TARGETS
Number 1.3
Category Policy and regulation
Summary Similar to Issue 1.1, an absence of program 
for electric mobility inhibit 
operationalization of national policy. With 
the exception of the ‘Electric Mobility 
Program’, a joint initiative from GGGI and 
Government of Nepal, there are no focused 
programs for electric mobility initiated at 
the national or local level. Such programs 
have the benefit of operationalization, even 
in the absence of directives or legislation, 
and permit government to pilot or trial new 
ideas, design specific and focused 
interventions and generally advance toward 
policy achievement without (or in parallel 
to) regulatory action as described in Issue 
1.1. In part this absence is linked to a lack of 
data (see Barrier 15). While there is a 
‘Green Stickers Program’, it is targeted at 
reduced central city air pollution. 
Result Policy remains unimplemented; new ideas 
for policy implementation are not trialed 
Action See Priority Action 1
ISSUE ABSENCE OF PERFORMANCE STANDARDS 
AND GUIDELINES FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES 
AND FACILITIES 
Number 1.4
Category Policy and regulation
Summary There is no regulation in place describing 
the minimum performance requirements of p
particularly needed in terms of charging 
facilities to optimize utilization. 
Result Lack of clarity on how electric vehicles 
should perform; facilities are unspecified 
Action See Priority Action 1
ISSUE ABSENCE OF REGULATION FOR VEHICLE 
CONVERSION AND HYBRIDIZATION
Number 1.5
Category Policy and regulation
Summary There is no policy or regulation in place to 
support the modification, adaptation or 
conversion of petrol and/or diesel vehicles 
to electric vehicles. This discourages 
initiative and innovation, and restricts 
vehicle owners wishing to modify, adapt or 
convert their vehicles. It also leads to issues 
of safety, as some vehicle owners illegally 
modify, adapt or convert using unsafe 
methods – especially in light of the price of 
electric vehicles on the Nepali market.
Result Conversion of petrol vehicles to electric 
vehicles cannot be undertaken legally; risk 
of unsafe conversion; consumers are not 
supported to take action
Action See Priority Action 1, and Initiative 3
Barrier 2. Insufficient Management of Vehicle Operators 
In Nepal’s larger cities, especially Kathmandu, public 
transport operators tend to be small and numerous. In 
addition to public transport operators, other vehicle 
operators, such as local government solid waste 
management vehicle fleets, are not encouraged to go 
electric. Decision-making procedures, overall governance, 
and managerial protocols put in place by governmental 
bodies appear to undermine national policy and targets for 
electric mobility by discouraging the acquisition and 
operation of electric fleets.
ISSUE SUBOPTIMALITY OF ROUTE AND PERMIT 
MANAGEMENT
Number 2.1
Category Governance
Summary Public transport operators require permits 
to operate on specific routes. The 
management of these permits and routes 
y, g pp
and outcomes. New operators seeking to 
mobilize electric public transport vehicles 
can face challenges in acquiring required 
route permits. 
Result Uptake of electric vehicles by public 
transport operators is discouraged; some 
operators are confused
Action See Priority Action 1, Priority Action 2, and 
Initiative 4
ISSUE BAN ON REGISTRATION OF NEW THREEWHEELERS (INCLUDING ELECTRIC)
Number 2.2
Category Governance
Summary Since 2001, registration of new threewheelers (tempos, auto-rickshaws) has 
been closed due to perceived saturation. 
This ban affects both petrol and electric 
three-wheelers. This undermines the ability 
of public transport operators to introduce 
new electric three-wheelers onto their 
routes. It also undermines the uptake of 
electric vehicles within a range of other 
sectors - for example, local government 
initiatives aimed at introducing electric 
three-wheelers for waste collection have 
been blocked. This ban is not backed by a 
vehicle specific emissions/pollutiondependent decision. Over the course of 
2017, efforts were undertaken to remove 
electric three-wheelers from this ban (i.e. to 
modify the ban so that it only applies to 
petrol and diesel three-wheelers). However, 
this exemption is still to be granted.
Result Uptake of electric three-wheelers is 
restricted
Action See Priority Action 1, Priority Action 2, and 
Initiative 5
Barrier 3. Limited Governance of Vehicle Distributers 
Several firms in Nepal are importing and distributing 
electric vehicles. This activity is essential for electric vehicle 
uptake as it permits consumer acquisition. However, 
governance of distributers is inadequate, leading to 
suboptimal outcomes for the consumer and a subsequent 
reduction in electric vehicle uptake.Category Governance
Summary Prices of electric vehicles in Nepal are high, 
despite significant reductions in customs 
tax and exemption from value added tax.50
Models on the Nepali market retail at prices 
some 3-4 times higher than on the nearby 
Indian market. This elevated price point 
means that electric vehicles tend to be seen 
as luxury goods, often purchased as second 
or third cars. The elevated prices reduce 
consumption and undermine a broader goal 
of increasing electric mobility. Better 
governance of distributors and tighter 
regulation of prices would help to provide 
the market with more affordable vehicle 
models.
Result Prices for electric vehicles remain high, 
reducing consumption
Action See Priority Action 3
Barrier 4. Restrained Political Support and Coordination 
To advance implementation of electric mobility goals and 
targets, political commitment is needed at all levels, 
federal, provincial and local. Currently, such commitment is 
not secured. While the topic has become politicized, 
political commitment is undermined by inconsistency, 
fragmentation and agenda conflicts at various levels. Many 
of these issues are closely linked to Barrier 5, below. 
ISSUE LIMITED POLITICAL COMMITTMENT
Number 4.1
Category Governance
Summary Transforming policy into regulation and 
executive action requires consistency of 
political and legislative effort. However, 
high levels of change within the 
government and political structures of 
Nepal have led to inconsistencies. Outside 
of governmental stability, the goal of 
electric mobility is also undermined by 
short-termism. During intense periods of air 
pollution and fuel supply disruptions, 
 
50 For example, as at Q4 2017, the Mahindra e20 Plus retailed in Nepal at 
NPR 31 lakh (3,100,000) or approximately USD 30,000. The same vehicle 
retailed in India for INR 746,225 (USD 11,500) including a government 
incentive in price reduction under the FAME scheme. Without this 
incentive, which is INR 138,000, the market retail price is INR 884,225 
gp
vehicle market is undermined
Action See Priority Action 2
Issue LIMITED PRIORITIZATION OF AIR QUALITY 
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL
Number 4.2
Category Governance
Summary Despite the Local Self Governance Act
(1999), which specifies that municipalities 
are responsible for air pollution, for many 
local governments, air quality is 
deprioritized in favor of other issues, 
considered to be more pressing, such as 
sanitation, water supply and solid waste 
management. Air quality tends not to be 
monitored by local governments. 
Result The air quality advantages of low- or zeroemissions vehicles are not fully appreciated.
Action See Priority Action 2
ISSUE INTER-MINISTERIAL COORDINATION IS AD
HOC
Number 4.3
Category Institutions
Summary Government activities for electric mobility 
are not coordinated by a centralized 
committee, taskforce or other such 
mechanism. In the absence of such, degrees 
of coordination are maintained through 
discussions, workshops and entities set up 
on an ad-hoc basis. However, greater 
coordination and therefore effectiveness 
for concerted efforts could be achieved via 
the use of a coordinating committee for 
electric mobility. Communication between 
ministries on electric mobility issues is 
limited.
Result Fragmentation of efforts across 
government continues

Infrastructure and market barriers and issues are presented 
in Figure 8.1 below.
Figure 8.1. Overview of barriers and issuesThe following are the specific infrastructure and market 
barriers to greater adoption of electric vehicles in Nepal.
Barrier 5. Insufficient Investment in Facilities 
Currently, there is very little investment in electric vehicle 
infrastructure and facilities in Nepal. This poses a significant 
barrier to greater electric vehicle adoption, as the 
availability of especially charging facilities is critical for 
widespread uptake. 
ISSUE INSUFFICIENCY OF CHARGING FACILITIES 
FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES
Number 5.1
Category Infrastructure
Summary Private consumers of electric vehicles tend 
to charge their vehicles at home. This is the 
case for both electric cars and motorbikes. 
However, the provision of public charging 
stations is critical for widespread uptake, 
especially along intercity routes (for 
example, between Kathmandu and 
Pokhara), and at key locations in and 
around major cities. Greater public-private 
initiatives need to be taken for this to 
progress. For example, the public sector 
could provide land and the private sector 
install facilities, for joint investment and 
development of charging centers.
Result Consumers remain concerned about the 
practicalities of charging once they have left 
their homes; consumer concern on this 
issue leads to reduced consumption
Action See Priority Action 3, and Initiative 7
ISSUE ABSENCE OF BATERY RECYCLING OR 
PROCESSING FACILITY
Number 5.2
Category Infrastructure
Summary Simple and relatively cheap methods exist 
for neutralizing battery acid, and/or 
processing and recycling battery 
components. However, there is no such 
facility in Nepal. As a result, batteries are 
either sent to India for recycling, which 
tends to be expensive, or they are dumped 
in landfill sites or ‘recycled’ as cleaning 
gp
batteries; pollution and higher operational 
costs
Action See Priority Action 3, and Initiative 8
Barrier 6. Limited Investment in Mass Transportation 
While the establishment of both rail and bus electric mass 
transportation systems is a goal of national policy, there 
has been limited action. Master-planning, analysis, and 
research are being undertaken so support informed 
decision making, and coordination, for the establishment of 
such systems. Targets for both electric rail and electric mass 
transportation (bus) are included in the National 
Determined Contribution. 
ISSUE LIMITED DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRIC RAIL
Number 6.1
Category Infrastructure
Summary The development of electric rail systems 
requires strong political commitment, 
significant financial and technical resources, 
and sustained support from a range of 
stakeholders. These components have been 
challenging to muster in Nepal. As a result, 
there has been limited development of 
electric rail. While initial scoping studies 
and planning programs have been 
undertaken, these have yet to lead to the 
establishment of a functioning rail system.
Result Road transport remains dominant; lack of 
modal alternatives for freight or commuters
Action See Priority Action 2 and Initiative 9
ISSUE LIMITED DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRIC 
MASS TRANSPORT (BUS)
Number 6.2
Category Infrastructure
Summary Electric public bus transport systems remain 
under-invested. In part, this is linked to 
higher acquisition costs, as well as 
procurement challenges. Currently, there 
are no full-size electric buses operating in 
Nepal. With strong demand for public 
transport, and limited supply there is scope 
for improvement in this area. 
Result Limited electrification of bus systems
Action See Priority Action 2 and Initiative 10As noted earlier, governance of electric vehicle distributors 
could be improved in order to overcome market results 
that are not favorable to adoption of electric vehicles. In 
particular, the price of consumer electric cars is particularly 
high, often beyond the reach of the average car buyer. 
Electric motorbikes, on the other hand, are more 
moderately priced. 
ISSUE INADEQUATE COMPETITION IN THE 
MARKET
Number 7.2
Category Market
Summary The federal government maintains a 
national trading company, designed to 
import and distribute goods at low prices. 
This helps to foster competition across the 
market and increase consumption. 
However, within the automotive sector the 
government had no trading activity. The 
market, overall, remains uncompetitive and 
results in low demand. Greater government 
activity could help to enhance the market 
through government-led distribution.
Result The electric vehicle market is not 
competitive; low consumer demand
Action See Priority Action 2 and Priority Action 3
Category Markets
Summary While Nepal has experience assembling 
electric three wheelers over the 1990s2000s, there is limited activity in the 
manufacturing sector currently. Only Tailg, 
a Chinese company, is actively 
manufacturing electric motorbikes in Nepal. 
The relative absence of local manufacturing 
contributes to the high prices of electric 
vehicles overall, underlying Issues 7.1 and 
7.2 above. 
Result Electric vehicles must be imported 
contributing to higher retail prices
Action See Priority Action 2, Priority Action 3, as 
well as Initiative 11
Barrier 8. Uncertainty of Electricity Supply and Cost 
For market confidence in electric vehicles, consumers must 
be able to broadly assume stability of electricity supply. 
Unfortunately, that assumption cannot be fully made in the 
case of Nepal. In addition, there are no fixed charging fees 
tailored to electric vehicles, meaning that consumers must 
be willing to accommodate fluctuations in the per unit price 
of electricity. Both components contribute to a degree of 
uncertainty in terms of charging which undermines 
consumption.
ISSUE ELECTRICITY SUPPLY EXPERIENCES 
INSTABILITY
Number 8.1
Category Market
Summary Despite progress over 2016-17, supply of 
electricity, especially in Nepal’s larger cities, 
is still unstable. This restricts appetite for 
electric vehicles. There are periods of load 
shedding and during such situations, 
electric vehicles cannot be charged.
Consumers are aware of these supply issues 
and make decisions accordingly. However, 
charging stations have been made available 
for electric three-wheelers (safa tempos), 
which ensure charge during periods of load 
shedding. Such charging stations need to be 
made more plentiful, and accessible to 
private vehicle owners. Overall, long-term 
supply needs to be proactively developed if 
ISSUE UNREASONABLY PRICED ELECTRIC 
VEHICLES
Number 7.1
Category Market
Summary As outlined in Barrier 3 above, the market 
price of electric vehicles in Nepal remains 
high, compared to prices for similar models 
in neighboring markets. This price 
difference cannot be explained solely in 
terms of higher freight or transport costs 
into the Nepali market. The price difference 
is particularly noted given the low customs 
tax and exemption from value added tax 
which electric vehicles in Nepal enjoy. 
Increased competition in the market could 
help to reconcile the market price of 
electric vehicles.
Result Electric vehicles are priced beyond the 
reach of most citizens
Action See Priority Action 3.y ppy pp
appetite for electric vehicles
Action See Priority Action 1, Priority Action 2,
Initiative 12 and Initiative 13
ISSUE ABSENCE OF TIME OF DAY METERING FOR 
PRIVATE CONSUMERS
Number 8.2
Category Market
Summary While electricity consumed during off-peak 
periods is cheaper, domestic metering (i.e. 
at consumers’ homes) does not 
accommodate time of day charging. As 
such, consumers are offered a low, 
overnight charge for their electric vehicles, 
but are not able to capitalize on it. 
Improvements in metering would help to 
consumer commitment to electric vehicles. 
Result Consumers lack certainty of operating 
costs, which can reduce consumption 
Action See Priority Action 1, Priority Action 2 and 
Initiative 12
Barrier 9. Under-Development of Markets 
Overall, electric vehicle markets are underdeveloped in 
Nepal. This applies to sectors of the market, particularly the 
electric two-wheeler market, as well as associated markets 
such as spare parts. In addition, there is a lack of public 
awareness and education on the benefits of electric 
vehicles. These issues converge resulting in lowered 
demand for electric vehicles.
ISSUE INADEQUACY OF PUBLIC AWARENESS AND 
UNDERSTANDING
Number 9.1
Category Market
Summary Overall, public awareness of electric 
vehicles, particularly their benefits, remains 
low. While this situation is improving, in 
part due to growing attention to air quality 
and the promotional work of civil society 
and private sector, there is a long way to 
go. Linked to Issue 9.4 below.
Result Reduced demand for electric vehicles; 
reduced consumption
Action See Priority Action 1, Priority Action 2, and 
Initiative 14
ON THE ROADS
Number 9.2
Category Market
Summary There are very few examples of electric 
mobility leadership on the roads. As a 
result, the public and potential consumers 
are not exposed to clear messaging and 
support for electric vehicles. Safa tempos
(electric three-wheelers) are the only 
current example leadership, and much of 
the safa tempo fleet is in poor repair. 
Outside of this, there are no pilot electric 
vehicles fleets in the government system, 
no leadership from taxi fleets, or from 
transport operators – despite operational 
savings potential. Greater leadership on the 
roads would help to create a broader
consumer market for electric vehicles.
Result Public awareness of electric vehicles 
remains low; reduced consumption and 
interest
Action See Priority Action 1, Priority Action 2, and 
Initiative 15
ISSUE INADEQUACY OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE SPARE 
PARTS MARKET
Number 9.4
Category Market
Summary ACROSS ALL VEHICLE TYPES
Electric vehicle spare parts, for example 
batteries, do not enjoy the same low 
customs tax and exemption from value 
added tax, as fully assembled vehicles. 
Rather, spare parts are subject to a customs 
tax of X per cent. This reduces import and 
reduces market availability of spare parts. 
As a result, buyers of electric vehicles must 
confront the possibility of vehicle 
maintenance challenges.
Result Risk of high maintenance costs for electric 
vehicle owners; reduced consumption of 
assembled vehicles
Action See Priority Action 3p, pgy 
vehicle type by far, constituting some 80% of the total 
vehicle fleet. Given the dominance of two-wheelers, almost 
of all of which are petrol-powered, there is significant scope 
to develop the consumer market for electric vehicles 
broadly, by focusing on the development of the electric 
two-wheeler market.
ISSUE UNDERSUPPLY OF ELECTRIC TWOWHEELERS
Number 10.1
Category Market
Summary Demand for two-wheelers is very high. This 
segment is also the fastest growing. 
However, there is scarcely any supply of 
electric two-wheelers. The Indian 
manufacturer, Hero, closed its operations,
and the Chinese manufacturer Tailg has 
recently started production. Some 
consumers complain of low-quality 
performance, which hampers uptake. There 
is great scope to supply major Nepali cities 
with mid-range, low-cost electric twowheelers. Electric two-wheelers open the 
yg y 
very limited options on the current market
Action See Priority Action 3, and Initiative 11
ISSUE RIGOROUSNESS OF TESTING FOR ELECTRIC 
TWO-WHEELERS
Number 10.2
Category Market
Summary Current regulation for electric two-wheelers 
is strict. Electric two-wheelers are subject 
to performance standards that are difficult 
to meet. Such testing requirements can
dampen demand and
reduce consumer uptake. By easing the 
regulation and removing or lessening some 
performance requirements, consumer 
appetite is likely to increase. 
Result Motorcyclists wishing to buy electric have 
very limited options on the current market
Action See Priority Action 1 and Priority Action 2
 9.1 Introduction
Financing and resource barriers and issues are presented in 
Figure 9.1 below.
Figure 9.1. Summary of prioritized barriers and issuesThe following are the specific financing and resource 
barriers to greater adoption of electric vehicles in Nepal.
Barrier 11. Limited Government Incentive 
There is currently no government-led financing for electric 
mobility. The government has minimized disincentives, 
through reform of the customs and value added tax 
regimes for electric vehicles. This is a positive development. 
However, government current does not provide any 
proactive incentive for switching to electric. Such an 
incentive, in the form of a subsidy, would be useful.
ISSUE ABSENCE OF NATIONAL SUBSIDY FOR 
ELECTRIC VEHICLES
Number 11.1
Category Financing
Summary The provision of a focused subsidy to 
support switching to electric vehicles is an 
effective mechanism for boosting
consumption of electric vehicles. Such as 
subsidy can apply to either or both private 
consumers and public transport operators
seeking to procure electric vehicles into 
their fleets. Such a subsidy would typically
reduce retail vehicle price or loan interest 
rate.
Result Consumers and operators are expected to 
bear the entire costs of switching to 
electric; reduced consumption
Action See Initiative 16.
ISSUE ABSENCE OF NATIONAL FUND OR 
FINANCING VEHICLE FOR ELECTRIC 
MOBILITY
Number 11.2
Category Financing
Summary Beyond a focused government subsidy 
(Issue 11.1) to stimulate consumption and 
procurement of electric vehicles, the
absence of any national financing vehicle or 
mechanism to provide government 
disbursement for other electric mobility 
initiatives more broadly is also an issue. 
Such a financing vehicle could support startups, entrepreneurs and other entities to 
improve electric mobility.
; p
Action See Priority Action 3
ISSUE GENERAL UNWILLINGNESS TO UNLOCK 
FINANCING
Number 11.3
Category Financing
Summary Funds are available within government that 
could be allocated to electric mobility. Such 
an action requires creative willingness to 
find and unlock financing and establish 
mechanisms of disbursement. In addition to 
government-held funds, international 
donors could be sought to provide targeting 
financing. Neither activities are being fully 
pursued, especially given the growing global 
interest in electric vehicles. Lastly, it should 
be noted that such financing could be 
disbursed through focused public-private 
partnerships.
Result Consumers and operators are expected to 
bear the entire costs of switching to 
electric; reduced consumption
Action See Priority Action 2, Priority Action 3 and 
Initiative 17.
Barrier 12. Vulnerability of Federal Revenue 
Federal revenue is largely fiscal, and of that, the tax on 
petrol and diesel vehicles plays an important role. A wider 
switch towards electric vehicles, therefore, has revenue 
implications for the federal government which could be 
quite meaningful if such a switch were widespread.
ISSUE STRUCTURE OF TAX REVENUE TO 
GOVERNMENT
Number 12.1
Category Financing
Summary Currently, customs tax on fossil fuel vehicles 
generates a significant share of total 
government tax revenue. As a result, the 
widespread adoption of electric vehicles 
would lead to a direct loss of government 
revenue, due to the extremely low customs 
tax on electric vehicles. While low customs 
tax for electric vehicles is a positive and
demonstrates fiscal support for a switch 
towards electric mobility, the polarized gg 
better fiscal balance that delivered wins for 
both consumers and government might be 
more effective in the long-term.
Result Structural vulnerability within the fiscal 
regime; disincentive for government to 
pursue electric mobility
Action See Priority Action 2
Barrier 13. Insufficient Human Resources 
There is limited availability of trained engineers and 
technicians for electric vehicles in Nepal. This constrains 
servicing, entrepreneurship and innovation. Programs in 
engineering colleges largely overlook electric vehicle 
technologies, reducing the capacity of next generation 
engineers.
ISSUE LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF ELECTRIC 
VEHICLE ENGINEERS
Number 13.1
Category Human resources
Summary There are few engineers in Nepal skilled at 
servicing, designing or developing electric 
vehicles. This limits the scope of 
development and business investment 
within the sector. It also reduces appetite 
for potential investment – public transport 
operators, for example, are aware that 
acquisition of electric vehicles will 
necessitate additional training and skills 
development of their engineering staff, 
leading to higher costs. 
Result Insufficient expertise on the job market; 
inadequate technical support to electric 
vehicle operators and consumers
Action See Priority Action 2 and Initiative 18.
ISSUE ABSENCE OF TECHNICAL CENTER FOR 
ELECTRIC VEHICLE ENGINEERING
Number 13.2
Category Human resources
Summary Numerous well reputed engineering schools 
operate in Nepal, particularly Kathmandu. 
However, most general program curricula 
overlook electric vehicle engineering, and 
there are no specialized programs focused 
on electric vehicles. This reduces 
ppg
students seeking to develop new skillsets; 
higher skills development costs for 
organizations and companies
Action See Priority Action 2
ISSUE LIMITED CAPACITY AMONGST ENGINEERS 
FOR EMISSIONS REDUCTION
Number 13.3
Category Human resources
Summary Practicing mechanics and technicians in 
workshops and garages tend to have 
limited capacity for emissions management 
through servicing. However, when diesel 
and petrol vehicles have been brought in 
for servicing can be a particularly effective
opportunity to clean exhaust systems and 
ensure minimized pollution.
Result Limited servicing for particulate matter 
emissions and air quality
Action See Priority Action 2 and Initiative 18
ISSUE LIMITED UNDERSTANDING AMONGST 
TRAFFIC POLICE
Number 13.4
Category Human resources
Summary Traffic police are tolerant of clearly 
polluting vehicles, having limited 
understanding of the issue and their 
responsibility to improve it. Such capacity 
can only be built following the passage of 
legislation enabling police to fine heavily or 
clearly polluting vehicles (see Issue 1.1). 
Currently, such legislation is absent; in 
effect, air pollution is legal. 
Result Polluting vehicles are not managed on the 
road
Action See Priority Action 1 and Priority Action 2
Barrier 14. Insufficient Entrepreneurship 
Entrepreneurship in the electric mobility sector is relatively 
quiet in Nepal. There is scope for greater investment, as 
opportunities are numerous. Entrepreneurs and investors 
currently hesitate to assemble and implement viable 
business projects. Category Investment
Summary Changes at multiple levels of government, 
regulatory and policy fluidity and a lack of 
transparency in certain areas of the 
transport sector constitute risk for investors 
and entrepreneurs. Greater stability and 
transparency would help to create an 
enabling environment for investment. 
Result Higher degrees of perceived uncertainty 
and risk; limited entrepreneurship
Action See Priority Action 1
ISSUE LIMITED START-UP CULTURE AND 
COMMERCIALIZATION
Number 14.2
Category Investment
Summary Business, investment and innovation within 
the electric mobility sector is not 
encouraged by government. There is an 
absence of commercialization campaigns, 
schemes, and programs, and more generally 
the start-up culture in Nepal is underdeveloped. Nonetheless, numerous 
opportunities for business investment exist 
pp p
opportunities and high demand
Action See Priority Action 1, Priority Action 2 and 
Priority Action 3
ISSUE LIMITED BANKING FOR ELECTRIC MOBILITY 
BUSINESSES
Number 14.3
Category Investment
Summary Interest rates on business loans are high 
(typically around 10-15%), forcing 
entrepreneurs into unfavorable terms. 
There are no priority loans provided for 
business projects within the electric 
mobility sector. Due to the high upfront 
costs of most electric mobility initiatives, 
and longer pay-back periods, low interest 
loans are essential.
Result Reduced entrepreneurial activity
Action See Priority Action 2, and Initiative 17
 
 
 10.1 Introduction
Data and monitoring barriers and issues are presented in 
Figure 10.1 below.
Figure 10.1. Summary of prioritized barriers and issuesThe following are the data and monitoring barriers to 
greater adoption of electric vehicles in Nepal.
Barrier 15. Insufficient Data Collection and Access 
Data are essential for implementation of the NDC, and 
overall management of greenhouse gas emissions in Nepal. 
However, there is a lack of reliable and useful data. This 
significantly complicates monitoring and undermines the 
evidence base required for good policy and decision 
making. In its place, policy decisions can become largely 
political, or influenced by special interest and lobby groups. 
In addition, emissions and air quality data help to justify 
increased investment in electric mobility.
ISSUE LACK OF DATA ON ELECTRIC VEHICLES
Number 15.1
Category Data collection
Summary Data is collected on the number and make 
of vehicles imported into Nepal. However, 
data is not collected on the number of 
these that are electric, nor the total number 
of electric vehicles operating on the roads. 
This complicates the accomplishing of 
quantitative targets for electric vehicle 
penetration set out in the NDC. In the 
absence of such data, private sector 
distributors may be approached, or
estimates may be made. Such data 
collection needs to be improved.
Result Uncertainty on the number of electric 
vehicles in Nepal; lack of evidence base
Action See Priority Action 1, Priority Action 2, 
Initiative 19 and Initiative 20
ISSUE LACK OF DATA ON CURRENT VEHICLE 
STOCK
Number 15.2
Category Data collection
Summary Similarly, current data collection practices 
do not include the number of vehicles 
scrapped. Most scrapping happens 
informally, without government 
notification, in part due to the high-costs of 
scrapping or demobilizing a vehicle. As 
such, it is impossible to know the current 
vehicle fleet. Instead, average vehicle 
y 
vehicles in Nepal; lack of evidence base
Action See Priority Action 1, 2 and Initiative 20
ISSUE INADEQUACY OF AIR QUALITY AND 
EMISSIONS DATA
Number 15.3
Category Data collection
Summary Several sources monitor air quality, 
including national government, local 
government, research institutes, foreign 
embassies and a civilian network. This has 
led to a fragmentation of data, and issues of 
reliability, understanding and access. 
Practices of air quality monitoring are not 
standardized and there are no guidelines in 
place, or necessarily aligned with 
international practice, making comparison 
difficult. In addition, national greenhouse 
gas emissions inventories are not well 
maintained, and therefore unreliable, with 
most recent using data from 2001 (Second 
National Communication to the UNFCCC). 
This absence of data, for example, creates 
problems for policy-setting bodies who 
struggle to ascertain baseline.
Result National emissions performance is 
unknown; lack of certainty around air 
quality in major cities; erosion of evidence.
Action See Priority Action 1, 2 and Initiative 20
ISSUE SUBOPTIMALITY OF ACCESS TO DATA
Number 15.4
Category Data access
Summary There are no standard mechanisms of 
access to data, such as online portals or 
public data sharing agreements. As such, 
there is a tendency amongst data collection 
bodies to become proprietary, especially 
when data can be monetized or when data 
demonstrates an inconvenient truth. Some 
publicly available civilian sources of data are 
not recognized by government. Within this 
context, access to data becomes difficult. 
Result Data sharing is undermined; evidence base 
for policy and decisions is eroded
Action See Priority Action 1, 2 and Initiative 2010.1 Introduction
Building off Part 3, Part 4 of this report lays out the 
proposed actions and initiatives that need to be 
implemented in order to build and strengthen a wide, 
transformative switch to electric mobility in Nepal. These 
actions and initiatives were designed in direct response to 
the barriers and issues identified in Part 3, through 
sustained engagement and consultation with stakeholders 
(see Figure 10.1). Please refer to the Chapter 6 for a full list 
of stakeholders consulted.
Figure 10.1 Barrier and action formulation process, g, 
a degree of prioritization and hierarch was introduced. This 
process resulted in two types of proposals:
• Priority Actions – Priority actions are high-level 
and involve the establishment of functional 
entities (i.e. an institution, a financing vehicle, an 
enterprise, a program etc). The four priority 
actions identified operate across both the supplyand demand-sides of the electric mobility markets. 
Each priority activity delivers solutions to multiple 
barriers, typically around 4-5 barriers, and many 
more issues, and delivers these solutions across 
categories (i.e. policy and governance, 
infrastructure and markets etc.). As such, priority 
actions are expected to receive the bulk of 
government and stakeholder effort, as they are 
designed to operate in a foundational and 
transformative way, stimulating a wide range of 
changes across the entire system for electric 
mobility. 
• Contributing Initiatives – Initiative are activities of 
limited scope that typically respond to a single 
issue identified in Part 3. Priority actions, while 
proactive in themselves, are typically composed of 
several initiatives. Additional initiatives can of 
course be designed and integrated into the 
operations of priority actions in the future. Twenty 
initiatives were identified and prioritized in this 
report.
10.2 Goals and Objectives
While priority actions and initiatives were identified and 
designed to respond to the barriers and issues of Part 3, 
they are all structured around a broader goal of achieving 
the transport targets set out in the NDC (see Chapter 1 and 
Chapter 2 for full discussion). Box 10.1 summarizes these.
With this goal in mind, the several specific objectives of the 
priority actions and initiatives outlined in the subsequent 
chapters include:
• To systematically, proactively and cohesively 
address the barriers and issues restricting wider 
uptake of electric mobility 
• To facilitate most effective utilization of financial, 
technical and human resources by identifying high 
priority activities into which resources can be 
channelized accordingly
• To facilitate cooperation across stakeholders
As such, the priority actions and initiatives which follow 
demonstrate a logic of ‘problem-solution’. As noted, all 
barriers and issues identified in Part 3 have a corresponding 
priority action(s) or initiative(s) and visa-versa.
Box 10.1 The NDC and its transport related targets
Nepal’s Nationally Determined Contribution includes 14 
targets to support climate change mitigation and 
adaption in Nepal. Of these targets, four focus on 
climate change adaptation; three focus on energy 
sources and supply; two address the forestry sector; one
addresses multi-sectoral mitigation; and four address the 
transportation sector.
The transportation sector NDC targets are:
• NDC Target 9: By 2020, Nepal aims to increase 
the share of electric vehicle up to 20% from 
2010 level.
• NDC Target 10: By 2050, Nepal will decrease its 
dependency on fossils in the transport sector by 
50% through effective mass public transport 
means while promoting energy efficient and 
electrical vehicles.
• NDC Target 11: Nepal will develop its electrical 
(hydro-powered) rail network by 2040 to 
support mass transportation of goods and 
public commuting.
• NDC Target 14: By 2025, Nepal will strive to 
decrease the rate of air pollution through 
proper monitoring of sources of air 
pollutants like wastes, old and 
unmaintained vehicles, and industries.

National unit11.1 Introduction
Three priority actions are outlined below. These priority
actions form a three-part framework designed to respond 
to and overcome barriers identified in Part 3. Priority 
actions are supported by contributing initiatives, outlined in 
the following chapter. 
Figure 11.1. Overview of Priority ActionsAction Establish a national unit, center or 
taskforce for electric mobility
Rationale Promotional and policy efforts to improve 
uptake of electric vehicles have tended to 
be split across a range of governmental 
and non-governmental organizations. A 
centralized government entity to act as 
the apex regulatory, oversight and 
promotional entity for electric vehicles 
and electric mobility is needed. Such an 
entity would be tasked with overseeing 
implementation of the proposed program 
(Priority Action 2), as well as a range of 
other initiatives related to electric 
mobility more broadly.
Goal and
objectives
The overall goal of the national unit would 
be to coordinate national efforts for 
greater uptake of electric vehicles, and 
broader switching to electric mobility.
Within this goal, the unit would seek to 
achieve the following objectives:
• To promote a broad switch 
towards electric mobility across 
relevant transport systems;
• To lead the implementation of 
the proposed program, in 
collaboration with relevant 
government and nongovernmental entities;
• To educate and raise the 
awareness of businesses,
government and consumers on 
the advantages of electric 
vehicles;
• To facilitate discussions on the 
provision of all supply-side 
requirements of successful 
adoption of electric vehicles.
Summary The proposed unit could be established, 
either as a unit within an existing 
government entity, or as a government 
entity that could be answerable to a board 
comprised of government, business and 
citizen representatives. The fundamental 
mandate of the unit would be the 
promotion of electric mobility across 
y p
One of the principal activities of the unit
would be to oversee the implementation 
of the proposed program. As part of this 
program, which consists of a package of 
measures, the unit would undertake to 
design and deliver a dedicated 
information campaign. The campaign 
would target business, government and 
consumers over a period of five years. 
Initially, a core staff for the unit could be 
seconded from relevant government 
entities, relocated from inside MOPIT, or 
sourced internationally. Funding for unit
would be expected though both national 
and international sources, including, at 
the national level, reprioritization of 
existing government funds, or reutilization of an existing levy. At the 
international level, sources of climate 
financing could be tapped and experts.
Outcome Greater awareness of the benefits and 
viability of electric vehicles; greater 
interest and demand for electric vehicles; 
cohesive and needed regulatory and 
legislative change; higher visibility 
advocacy and promotion of electric 
mobility across all areas of government; 
consolidation and coordination of 
government and private-sector efforts to 
boost electric mobility.
Barriers 
and Issues
This Priority Action responds to several 
key barriers identified in Part 3 of this 
Action Plan. These include
• Barrier 4, including Issues 4.1, 
4.2, 4.3, and 4.4
• Barrier 2, including Issues 2.1 and 
2.2
• Barrier 9, including Issues 9.1, 9.2 
and 9.3
• Barrier 12, in particular Issue 12.1
• Barrier 13, including Issue 13.1, 
13.2, 13.3 and 13.4
• Barrier 14, in particular Issue 14.2Action: Establish and implement national program for 
electric mobility.
Rationale: While some incentives are in place to support 
adoption of electric vehicles in Nepal, a range of barriers 
are obstructing progress – many of which can be overcome 
through proactive government initiative. A comprehensive 
package of measures needs to be identified and 
implemented that successfully shift from policy to action
and operationalize investment and activity for 
infrastructure and market development.
Goal and objectives: The overall goal of the national 
program should be to be promote and achieve greater 
uptake of electric vehicles across the domestic market, and 
design and undertake interventions for infrastructure and 
market development. 
Within this overall goal, the proposed comprehensive 
umbrella program includes the following objectives:
• To raise public awareness of the benefits and 
advantages of going electric;
• To support consumer acquisition and operation of 
electric vehicles;
• To support government acquisition and operation 
of electric vehicles;
• To support investment in infrastructure, mainly 
public charging stations; 
• To undertake legislative change required for 
greater electric vehicle adoption;
• To develop focused electric mobility 
implementation strategies and road maps at 
metropolitan level;
• To undertake markets assessments, preliminary 
and full feasibility studies and assessments for 
electric mobility initiatives;
• To develop guidelines, directives and other 
mechanisms to operationalize policy and targets.
Summary: The proposed program would comprise a suite 
of regulatory, institutional, financing and legislative 
measures designed to collectively provide focused support 
to boost electric vehicle adoption in Nepal. The government 
is aware of the numerous benefits, both shorter- and 
longer-term, of going electric and has put in place policy to 
enable widespread electric vehicle uptake. The package of 
measures that would be comprised within the national 
program include:
()
• Stimulating government procurement of electric 
vehicles into national and local government fleets 
(see Initiative 16)
• Investing in public charging infrastructure and 
supporting private investment (see Initiative 7)
• Establishing a financing vehicle that would co-fund 
a range of initiatives and investments to accelerate 
electric vehicle uptake (Priority Action 3)
• Undertaking changes to relevant legislation and 
regulatory frameworks to facilitate adoption of 
electric vehicles (see Initiatives 1, 2, 3)
Funding for this package of measures is expected to be 
secured though both national and international sources, 
including, at the national level, reprioritization of existing 
government funds, or re-utilization of an existing levy. At 
the international level, sources of climate financing could 
be tapped.
Outcome: Greater operational level action for electric 
mobility; greater demand for electric vehicles as a result of 
consistent efforts across all areas of infrastructure and 
markets; consolidation and coordination of government 
and private-sector efforts to boost electric mobility.
Barriers and Issues: This Priority Action responds to several 
key barriers identified in Part 3 of this Action Plan. These 
include
• Barrier 1, including Issues 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5
• Barrier 2, including issues 2.1 and 2.2
• Barrier 9, including Issues 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3
• Barrier 10, primarily Issue 10.2
It also facilitates action in response to Barrier 4, particularly 
Issue 4.1.
 Action Establish and operate a national financing 
vehicle to co-fund (with private sector)
electric mobility projects
Rationale Some barriers identified require joint 
government-industry investment in order 
to be overcome. For example, consumers 
may not take up electric vehicles until 
widespread charging stations are in place. 
And charging station operators may not 
invest until a critical mass of electric 
vehicles are on the roads. As such, there is 
a degree of fragmentation and a mismatch 
between supply and demand which needs 
to be overcome. To do this, the financing 
vehicle would co-fund projects that 
accelerate uptake of electric vehicles and 
also potentially provide a subsidy scheme. 
Such projects may not be economically 
justifiable without funding support. It is in 
order to spur action and boost private 
sector investment that the financing 
vehicle would be established. 
Goal and 
objectives
The overall goal of the financing vehicle is 
to maximize government and industry 
efforts and stimulate innovation by cofunding industry and business projects for 
electric vehicles and providing consumer 
subsidy. 
In addition, the following specific 
objectives would guide the financing 
vehicle’s operation:
• To provide co-funding on 
infrastructure projects critical to 
widespread electric vehicle 
adoption, especially projects that 
might not otherwise get funding;
• To provide financing and/or cofunding of price difference 
(viability gap) to business and 
government entities seeking to 
adopt electric vehicles into their 
fleets;
• To potentially develop a subsidy 
to support consumer acquisition 
of electric vehicles;
y p, 
co-funding selected operations 
accordingly;
• To occasionally distribute 
additional high-need financing, 
through various mechanisms 
(grants or loans).
Summary The proposed financing vehicle would
boost business and industry activity and 
investment in electric mobility and electric 
vehicles. Part of the role of the financing 
vehicle is to signal strong and consistent 
commitment from government to the 
market, reassuring entrepreneurs and 
investors. Through its funding decisions 
the financing vehicle would also help to 
put in place the necessary facilities and 
infrastructure for widespread electric 
vehicle adoption.
The financing vehicle could be 
administered or overseen by the unit.
Funding would be provided by both 
national and international sources. 
Nationally, funds accrued as a result of the 
pollution tax could be reprioritized into 
the electric mobility financing vehicle. 
These funds could be complemented via 
international grants.
The financing vehicle’s primary funding 
mechanism would take the form of cofunding to industry, business and 
householders. Examples of appropriate 
projects for such co-funding include:
• Initiatives to support 
procurement, such as helping 
fleet buyers and consumers meet
the viability gap (difference in 
purchase price between electric 
and equivalent conventional 
vehicles)
• Creation and promotion of 
branded tourism routes using 
electric vehicles, for example 
tourist electric buses
• Demonstration (pilot) projects of 
vehicle types, such as electric p
electric taxi fleets, in particular, 
and support for hybridization or 
conversion of existing 
conventional vehicle taxi fleets 
• Initiatives aimed at 
commercializing useful facilities, 
such as charging facilities and 
battery swap and leasing 
schemes, to consumers and 
business users
Outcome Increased entrepreneurship for electric 
mobility; increased investment and 
development of critical electric vehicle 
infrastructure.
• Barrier 2, including issues 2.1 and 
2.2
• Barrier 5, including Issues 5.1
• Barrier 11, including Issues 11.1, 
11.2 and 11.3
• Barrier 14, in particular Issue 14.2 
and 14.312.1 Introduction
As noted in the introduction, each initiative is designed to 
achieve a specific change and responds to a specific issue. 
As for Part 3, change is structured into four categories, 
namely 1) Policy and Governance; 2) Infrastructure and 
Markets; 3) Financing and Resources; and 4) Data and 
Monitoring. As indicated in Figure 12.1, below, each 
initiative identified contributes to one or more Priority 
Actions.
 
12.2 Initiatives for Policy and Governance

MANAGEMENT FOR ELECTRIC PUBLIC 
TRANSPORT
Number 4
Category Governance
Barrier This initiative responds to Barrier 2, Issue 
2.1
Summary Obtaining of routes and permits are 
critical for successful electric public 
transport operators. Improving 
management of routes and permits, 
especially for electric vehicle transport 
operators, would support greater 
investment from businesses. Electric 
public transport operators should receive 
special treatment, for example, 
exemption of permit costs; and targets for 
gradual replacement of conventional 
public transport vehicles with electric 
should be agreed with operators. 
Result Improved certainty and transparency of 
route and permit management; greater 
interest from vehicles and fleet operators 
and associated businesses
Priority

6.1
Summary Nascent rail systems in Nepal can be 
electrified before diesel-based rail 
systems become too widespread. It is 
cheaper to act now, than to retrofit later. 
Such infrastructure requires robust 
investment from national government 
and strong political support.
Result Increased investment in electric rail 
Priority

7.2
Summary Small electric vehicles can be assembled 
and/or manufactured in Nepal. This would 
support the supply of low priced electric 
vehicles on the domestic market, 
something currently needed. Such an 
assembly or manufacturing project could 
be launched by local entrepreneurs with 
experience in the manufacture of electric 
three-wheelers. Co-funding and/or 
improved bank financing would support 
start-ups to accommodate initial capital 
expenditure required for production.
Result Improved commercial viability of local 
manufacturing of electric vehicles; 
improved supply of low-cost electric 
vehicles on the market
Priority 
Action
Such an initiative would require the

INITIATIVE PROMOTE THE INTRODUCTION OF TIMEOF-DAY METERING AT HOMES
Number 13
Category Market
Barrier This initiative responds to Barrier 8, Issue 
8.2
Summary Currently, electricity meters at homes do 
not measure time of usage. This results in 
a disincentive for consumers to optimize 
off-peak tariffs. By introducing time-ofday metering at homes, owners of electric 
vehicles can make the most of reduced 
nigh-time electricity tariffs to charge their 
vehicles. 
Result Lower operating costs for consumers of 
electric vehicles; better electric supply 
management
Priority 
Action
Comprised within package of measures 
for the program (Priority Action 1); the 
national taskforce (Priority Action 2) 
would lead this initiative in partnership 
with relevant power authorities.

 By identifying barriers and issues restricting the adoption of 
electric mobility in Nepal, this National Action Plan was able 
to present, in turn, a comprehensive set of actions and 
initiatives designed to boost uptake. These actions and 
initiatives were identified following intensive multilateral 
stakeholder consultations across government, business, 
scientific organizations and consumers. They are designed 
to support implementation and achievement of the 
transport targets outlined in Nepal’s Nationally Determined 
Contribution. 
Above all, the National Action Plan advocates for the 
viability of change. The Government of Nepal has already 
concluded much important policy and regulatory work to 
gpy , 
of contributing initiatives.
The Ministry of Forests and Environment, the Ministry of 
Physical Infrastructure and Transport, with their partner the 
Global Green Growth Institute, firmly believe that the 
completion of these remaining actions and initiatives is 
within reach. Key enabling conditions are already in place 
to facilitate such efforts. Moving forward, both ministries
and the GGGI stand ready to support the wider government 
and the development community to achieve this work for 
electric mobility in Nepal.

The overall framework for the preparation of this Action Plan was set by a combination of GGGI knowledge and experience 
developing NDC implementation tools; globally emerging best practices advocated by Ricardo Energy and Environment and 
CDKN (Climate and Development Knowledge Network); and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). The GGGI team 
gratefully acknowledges the work of both these agencies in this field and recognizes the precedent and best practices they have 
established. In particular, the work and methods of Ricardo Energy and Environment were built up in the methodological 
development of this Action Plan, under consultation with experts within the government and development community in Nepal.
Overall, a highly participatory approach was taken, blending qualitative and quantitative data, and using data gathering methods 
including key informant interviews with over twenty priority stakeholders, focus group discussions with transport operators and 
investors, and a small survey with current and prospective electric vehicle consumers.
