from the Minister 
of Energy and Water
While Lebanon assesses its progress towards the target of 12% renewable 
energy in 2020, the Ministry of Energy and Water has mobilised stakeholders 
nationwide to set new objectives for the next decade. This Renewable 
Energy Outlook report comes at the ideal moment to help set up a clear and 
well-designed roadmap, specifically for Lebanon to reach new horizons in 
renewable energy development by 2030.
Thanks to the efforts of the International Renewable Energy Agency 
(IRENA), and with the involvement of numerous national and international 
stakeholders, this report presents the Renewables Readiness Assessment 
(RRA) and Renewable Energy Roadmap (REmap) country analysis of 
Lebanon. In doing so, the report pinpoints challenges and barriers, showcases 
success stories and achievements, and most importantly proposes solutions 
and measures to move forward to an ambitious REmap scenario whereby 
30% of Lebanon’s electricity mix would be renewable energy by 2030. 
Allow me to thank all the IRENA team members who contributed to the 
realisation of this report. I am also grateful to all the representatives and 
stakeholders involved. The work invested in developing this report will have 
a positive impact on Lebanon’s sustainable energy transition for years to 
come, thus contributing to the grand energy transition that IRENA is striving 
to achieve in all parts of the world. On behalf of the Ministry of Energy and Water, I would like to confirm 
Lebanon’s determination to use this outlook in shaping our future action 
plans. Undoubtedly, we will use the contents of this report in developing 
the next National Renewable Energy Action Plan for Lebanon, covering 
the period 2021-2025. While the renewable energy market in Lebanon has 
witnessed considerable advancements in the past ten years, we are now 
more determined than ever to step up investment efforts for a better, more 
sustainable, future.
I am fully aware that to achieve all these promising targets, a strong 
partnership between the public and private sectors is needed. We are also 
eager to work with international friends and partners to make renewable 
energy a main pillar of the Lebanese energy sector. Together, we will make 
this happen.

Minister of Energy and Water
Lebanese RepublicFOREWORD
from the IRENA
Director-General
Along with the rest of the world, Lebanon has confronted an unexpected, and 
in many ways unprecedented, combination of health and economic shocks 
in 2020. While the COVID-19 pandemic has brought grief and hardship, the 
need to respond quickly and effectively has underlined the value of close, 
transparent co-ordination. Beyond short-term recovery measures, the 
country and its people need to focus their efforts together on longer-term 
improvements, including ensuring energy security and building a resilient 
economy.
As the country moves forward, renewable energy technologies offer the 
prospect of stable, clean power and heat systems. Along with other Middle 
Eastern net energy importers, Lebanon has faced a widening gap between the 
supply and consumption of electricity in recent years. Economic development 
and population growth have pushed its existing power infrastructure to the 
limit. An increasingly renewable-based system, in contrast, would mean 
reliable domestic power services, sufficient to match growing demand and 
consistent with global climate goals.
To prepare for future needs, Lebanon has set out to diversify its energy mix. 
This started with national action plans to scale up renewables and improve 
energy efficiency in 2016-2020, with an initial target for solar, wind, bioenergy 
and hydropower to cover some 12% of primary energy consumption. With 
small-scale renewable applications gaining ground, more recent plans have 
raised the target to 30% renewable energy consumption, spanning both 
electricity and heat demand, by 2030. Renewable Energy Outlook: Lebanon, prepared in collaboration with the 
Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) and the Lebanese Center for Energy 
Conservation (LCEC), identifies key challenges as the country pursues 
environmentally and economically sustainable power and heat. The report 
highlights the policy, regulatory, financial and capacity-building actions 
needed to meet or surpass current targets. It combines the results of countryled stakeholder consultations with a comprehensive roadmap to maximise 
the deployment of renewables through 2030. 
Through an updated, sustainability-focused energy policy, Lebanon could 
achieve 30% renewable electricity consumption by 2030, saving nearly 
USD 250 million per year in the power sector, mainly through avoided fossilfuel imports. Electricity services, which until now have added to the deficit, 
could instead ease the government’s debt load. Recent tenders for renewable 
power have attracted strong international interest, and Lebanon’s resolve to 
take this vision forward remains firm.
IRENA wishes to thank the MEW and LCEC teams for their key input and 
engagement. We also appreciate the valuable contributions of numerous 
other stakeholders and international partners. I sincerely hope the resulting 
study helps to accelerate Lebanon’s shift to a sustainable energy future.

wEXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Energy and electricity demand have weighed heavily on the Lebanese 
economy in recent years. Imported fuel oil alone accounts for nearly a 
quarter of the national budget deficit. Population growth has pushed 
energy use up steadily, with the demand for power increasingly 
exceeding existing generation capacity. 
While private producers have helped to close the gap, such 
arrangements are costly for both consumers and the national 
utility, Electricité du Liban (EDL). Renewable energy technologies, 
in contrast, promise stable, clean, fully domestic power and heat 
systems. Amid the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in early 2020, 
renewables and energy efficiency have become a key part of the 
country’s recovery plans.
Lebanon currently relies on gasoline, fuel oil and gas oil, which are 
100% imported. Energy security concerns, combined the need to 
support economic growth, have driven an energy diversification 
strategy. 
This strategy was outlined in two updates to a key electricity reform 
paper: the first in 2010, which further led to the National Energy 
Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) in 2011 and the National Renewable 
Energy Action Plan (NREAP) for 2016–2020; and the second 
producing the NEEAP for 2016-2020.
These action plans build on the high availability of renewable energy 
sources and the potential for the deployment of renewable energy 
and energy efficiency measures to satisfy 12% of primary energy 
consumption for both electricity generation and heating purposes 
by 2020. 
Lebanon’s commitment to scaling-up the use of renewable energy 
technologies is fortified by ongoing updates to its renewable energy 
targets. A new target aiming to meet 30% of total primary energy 
consumption (electricity and heating demand) from renewables by 
2030 was introduced in 2018 and formed the basis of a first update 
to the electricity reform paper in March 2019. To date, total installed 
renewable energy power capacity amounts to 350 megawatts (MW), 
including 286 MW from hydropower sources, 7 MW from landfill 
and 56.37 MW from solar power. Therefore, additional measures 
are required to scale-up renewables to the level of 30% by 2030 as 
defined in this study’s REmap case.
Lebanon has ample renewable energy resources that may be utilised 
to achieve these targets, including both solar and wind potential. An 
action plan to guide the development of these resources has been 
produced by the Lebanese Centre for Energy Conservation (LCEC) – One outcome of the plan (under initiative 11) 
is to create the National Energy Efficiency and 
Renewable Energy Action (NEEREA) initiative. 
Developed in collaboration with the central bank 
of Lebanon (BDL), this facilitates the provision of 
low interest rate loans for all renewable energy 
applications and energy efficiency projects, with 
a loan ceiling of USD10 million per project and 
a maximum term of 14 years – including a grace 
period of between six months and four years.
Despite the challenges facing the energy sector in 
terms of grid infrastructure, this national financing 
scheme, designed to incentivise the market, has 
achieved remarkable success. Having financed 
more than 938 projects as of March 2019 it also 
signals the commitment and interest of both the 
public and private sectors to the deployment of 
renewable energy projects. 
In terms of large-scale projects, Lebanon 
signed its first power purchase agreement 
(PPA) for electricity consumption from 
renewables in 2018, with a total capacity of 
226 MW.
However, the success of these schemes has been 
overshadowed by several factors including the 
current policy, legal and institutional framework 
governing large-scale projects, and a lack of 
awareness of support schemes provided at the 
small-scale level, as highlighted in the Renewables 
Readiness Assessment (RRA) study. 
This study, which was done by the International 
Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) in collaboration 
with Lebanon’s Ministry of Energy and Water 
(MEW) and the LCEC, provides an in-depth 
assessment of the policy, regulatory, financial and 
capacity challenges that must be overcome to 
achieve the targets set out for 2030. 
In this context, the RRA methodology seeks to 
facilitate country-led consultations with multiple 
stakeholders, identify key challenges and highlight 
solutions to boost renewable energy deployment. 
It also provides an in-depth analysis based on the 
Renewable Energy Roadmap (REmap) analysis 
approach, identifying additional renewable 
energy potential and quantifying other factors 
such as costs, investment needs, and effects 
on externalities related to air pollution and the 
environment. 
Based on IRENA’s REmap analysis, Lebanon 
has the potential to supply 30% of its electricity 
mix from renewables by 2030. This amounts to 
doubling the share of renewable energy expected 
from existing plans and policies (the reference 
case scenario) and achieving a 10-fold increase 
on the roughly 3% rise recorded in 2014 (the base 
year of this analysis). This assessment utilises 
the updated targets and most recent electricity 
reform paper released in 2019. 
With renewable power, heat and fuels all factored 
in, renewable energy could provide around 10% 
of Lebanon’s total final energy supply in 2030, up 
from less than 1% overall in 2014. 
The REmap analysis also finds that due to the 
declining costs of renewable power technologies, 
their increased deployment could result in 
potential average savings in the power sector of 
USD249 million per year under an average case 
scenario when compared with the reference case. 
This is true even before factoring in the reduction 
in external costs from air pollution and CO2
emissions. Investment in renewable energy 
capacity in the power sector, in comparison to 
the reference case (i.e. the additional amount 
needed), is estimated at around USD2.2 billion. These costs do not include the infrastructure 
upgrades required to implement the REmap 
options. Yet the advantages are not limited to 
the reduction of costs and emissions but also 
offer broader socio-economic advantages and 
global benefits such as the creation of new 
jobs and markets, the injection of cash inflows, 
and improved energy security through the 
diversification of the energy mix.
Therefore, the successful realisation of such 
deployment would require major adjustments to 
policy, regulatory, technology, infrastructure and 
financing mechanisms. The current framework 
in place does not fully account for the rapid 
economic and technological changes taking place 
at the national and regional levels. This assessment 
finds that several key challenges would need to be 
addressed to further overcome the present energy 
crisis. Therefore, the following recommendations 
will allow Lebanon to meet – and, in due course, 
exceed – the existing targets in the NREAP.
1. Implement more stable and integrated 
regulations for renewable energy 
deployment 
Despite Lebanon’s ambitious renewable energy 
strategy, the NREAP has not translated into reality 
on the ground owing to the instability of the 
regulatory framework governing the energy sector. 
Law 462, adopted in 2002, paved the way for 
renewable energy sector privatisation in Lebanon 
and established the Electricity Regulatory 
Authority (ERA) to grant licenses for utility-scale 
applications. 
Law 462 was side-lined by Law 288 of 2014, 
which indicated that the Council of Ministers 
(CoM) and upon the recommendations of the 
MEW and Ministry of Finance (MoF) would 
license Independent Power Producers (IPPs). The 
existence of several laws of conflicting dispositions 
is not conducive to private sector investment in 
renewable energy projects. 
• Establish the Electricity Regulatory 
Authority
As per the provisions of law 462/2002, 
creating the Electricity Regulatory Authority 
(ERA) may provide a clear and single access 
point to the electricity sector for private 
companies. With clearly defined licensing 
procedures, the roles and scope of existing 
entities will also become clearer, including 
the LCEC, MEW, EDL, the Public Procurement 
Management Administration (PPMA), the 
Higher Council for Privatisation and the CoM. 
In the long term, to better meet the REmap 
target of supplying 30% of electricity 
generation using renewables, and in line with 
the latest announced targets, IRENA suggests 
including all energy-related laws under an 
overarching amended law. Thus, overruling 
any discrepancies or overlaps that exist 
between them. 
2. Adopt new measures for small-scale 
applications 
Net metering was applied in Lebanon following a 
decision of the Board of Directors of EDL. However, 
this is bound by the limitations of the industrial 
and commercial sectors. While at the municipality 
level, there is a lack of streamlined procedures 
and awareness among the local authorities and 
the general public about project implementation. 
Additionally, off-site installation or power 
wheeling and peer-to-peer energy exchange limit 
the possibilities for wider deployment of smallscale applications. • Integrate innovative market schemes
PPAs that allow developers to sell electricity 
directly to specific consumers could in turn 
open the way for peer-to-peer contracts. 
The REmap analysis finds that technological 
advancements in the areas of peer-topeer trading and blockchain may promote 
the implementation of community-scale 
renewable energy systems which, in turn, can 
boost the number of small-scale decentralised 
solar PV systems in Lebanon. In fact, the 
market for this type of application is already 
opening up in the country with the recent 
implementation of community-based net 
metering pilot projects that rely on hybrid 
solar PV systems.
• Reinstate incentives for the installation 
of solar water heaters and small-scale 
applications
Among renewable energy applications, 
solar water heaters (SWHs) were the first 
to be introduced to the Lebanese market 
under the NREAP/NEEAP for 2011-2015. 
Installed SWH collector areas amounted to 
669 291 square metres (sqm) by the end of 
2018, (LCEC, 2019c) with an immediate target 
to deploy 1 054 000 sqm by the end of 2020. 
The successful implementation of SWHs in 
Lebanon has largely been due to favourable 
NEEREA loans and cash-back applications, 
which slowed in 2015. IRENA’s REmap analysis 
finds that subsidising the price of heat 
pumps to increase competitiveness through 
financing with international grants will result 
in additional cost reductions.
3. Complement national targets with 
technology-specific renewable energy 
targets 
In 2018, Lebanon updated its renewable energy 
targets with the aim of raising the contribution 
of renewables in the electricity consumption mix 
to 30%. However, there is no clarity concerning 
the contributions of different renewable energy 
technologies or the split between sectors. 
Therefore, the REmap analysis complements the 
30% target by defining the individual target 
capacities for each technology: 1 000 MW of wind; 
601 MW of hydro; 2 500 MW of centralised solar 
PV; 500 MW of decentralised solar PV; and 13 MW 
of biogas. 
IRENA’s analyses on target-setting recommends 
setting sectoral objectives that combine energy 
efficiency and renewable energy deployments. 
This reinforces the government’s commitment to 
the scale-up of renewable energy technologies 
and ensures a private market supported by 
concrete government action plans.
4. Set enabling tools for the installation 
of heating and cooling
To date, national efforts to deploy renewables 
have largely centred around power – rather than 
heating and cooling applications that focus on 
SWHs. 
According to REmap analyses, setting subsidies 
for heat pumps to increase competitiveness and 
complement current SWH incentives may support 
the introduction of the tools required to improve 
the uptake of renewables in Lebanon’s heating 
and cooling sector. Furthermore, establishing a 
databank on application and current market status 
with tailored support programs may incentivise 
investments. 5. Reform the current market framework 
to increase investments and project 
bankability
Electricity in Lebanon is highly subsidised. 
Therefore, increasing tariffs and reducing 
electricity subsidies may encourage public and 
private investments in renewable energy projects 
and allow for the proliferation of renewables 
through small- and medium-scale deployment. 
6. Reinforce the grid and conduct grid 
impact assessments
Despite ample renewable energy potential in 
Lebanon, the grid is subject to major technical 
and non-technical losses, amounting to 21% in 
2018. Therefore, renewable energy projects – 
particularly large-scale projects – face significant 
difficulties. Several studies conducted by regional 
and international organisations have identified 
inconsistencies in the frequency readings of the 
grid. IRENA’s REmap analysis finds that the 30% 
target can be reached if the stability of the system 
is preserved.
• Reinforce the transmission grid
The updated policy paper for the electricity 
sector considers a compound annual growth 
rate (CAGR) of 3% coupled with a drop of 
8% in total energy demand assumed in 2020 
after the expected tariff increase. The REmap 
analysis finds that significant improvements 
to the transmission and distribution network 
may help meet electricity sector demand 
through expansion in installed capacity of 
grid-integrated renewables. Furthermore, 
increasing interconnection capacity by signing 
agreements to ease energy flow may facilitate 
higher levels of penetration of renewables and 
guarantee grid stability.
• Conduct a complete grid impact 
assessment
As highlighted in the REmap analysis, 
dynamic stability measures may assist in 
mitigating grid challenges such as power and 
frequency fluctuations. These may include the 
introduction of electricity storage systems 
close to renewable energy farms leading 
to multiple benefits, including enhanced 
grid stability and addressing curtailment 
concerns. In addition, IRENA’s 2017 study, 
Planning for the renewable future, suggests 
conducting specialised system studies on the 
renewable carrying capacity of the Lebanese 
transmission and distribution grid in different 
geographical zones, as well as a long-term 
generation adequacy studies. These exercises 
may help EDL to develop a realistic valuation 
of the potential of renewables to meet national 
power demand.7. Financing and the role 
of the private sector
Several incentives have been deployed in Lebanon 
to provide renewable energy finance, including 
the NEEREA, the Lebanon Energy Efficiency and 
Renewable Energy Finance Facility (LEEREFF) 
and the Green Economy Financing Facility (GEFF) 
loans that have helped promote distributed PV 
markets, coupled with financial incentives in the 
SWH market. However, weak risk allocation due 
to political instability; grid, resource and off-taker 
risk; and burdensome administrative schemes 
must all be addressed for both large-scale and 
small-scale applications. 
• Streamline administrative processes
EDL bankability constitutes a major challenge 
due to low tariffs and high subsidies, reflecting 
strong off-taker risk. In the first PPAs for 
the 226 MW Hawa Akkar wind project, the 
MEW was the main signatory, while EDL was 
provided access through a letter of credit 
signed by the central bank of Lebanon. 
Therefore, the adoption of a more permanent 
structure to address the creditworthiness of 
EDL may allow for better access to different 
guarantees. In this context, IRENA’s open 
solar contracts produced in collaboration with 
the Terawatt Initiative can be used to develop 
standardised country context templates. 
• Develop risk mitigation schemes 
specific to renewable energy projects 
by IFIs
Limited access to guarantees from the MoF 
or private guarantors constrains developers’ 
access to viable financing.
Considerable areas of land in regions with 
the highest solar and wind potential have 
unclear ownership licenses, resulting in major 
challenges for project developers that are 
responsible for land acquisition, whilst also 
increasing associated risks and costs. 
Risk mitigation instruments are not always 
easy to identify or obtain. IRENA’s online 
matchmaking service – offered through the 
Climate Investment Platform (CIP) – can 
be used to identify developers, lenders and 
investors. With suitable instruments, IFIs can 
move from issuing concessionary loans to 
providing blended finance (public–private cofinancing trades) and risk mitigation solutions 
to mobilise the local private sector. 
Areas with high solar 
and wind potential face 
licensing challengesI. INTRODUCTION
Country Background
Geography
The Lebanese Republic is a sovereign state located in Western Asia adjoining 
the eastern edge of the Mediterranean region from the south along a 79 km 
border. It has a total territory of 10 452 km2, with a 225 km coast along the 
Mediterranean Sea that features a narrow coastal plain that is 6.5 km at its 
widest point and lies below the Lebanon Mountains, which rise to a maximum 
elevation of 3088 meters. The Bekaa Valley separates the Lebanon and AntiLebanon Mountains, with the latter rising to 2 814 m.
Demographics
In 2017, the population of Lebanon was more than 6 million, according to the 
statistics of the World Bank (World Bank, 2019a). The population has grown by 
24% since 2012, owing to the influx of refugees from neighbouring countries. 
Figure 1 illustrates the sharp increase in population since 2000. Population 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013

Economics
The Lebanese economy has traditionally relied heavily 
on the service sector – focusing on banking, tourism, 
construction and real estate – and activities are mainly 
undertaken by private companies. Lebanon’s gross 
domestic product (GDP) was estimated at USD 53.6 
billion (current USD) in 2017 (World Bank, 2019b).
Situated at the nexus of regional conflicts, Lebanon 
suffers from uncertainty over regional conditions and 
potential spill-overs. While achieving positive GDP 
results in recent years, the country still falls short of its 
economic potential.
Challenges in the 
power sector echo 
throughout the 
economy
Power generation costs also weigh heavily on the 
Lebanese economy. The national electricity company, 
Electricité du Liban (EDL), accounts for reported 
deficits of around USD 2 billion. The company faces 
global oil price fluctuations, while also being subject 
to government caps on oil purchases, with direct and 
indirect implications throughout the economy.

STATUS AND PLANS
1. Primary energy supply
Lebanon relies on imports to satisfy its energy demand. In terms of primary 
energy, consumption is met using the following six major components:
• liquid petroleum gas (LPG);
• gasoline;
• gas oil;
• kerosene;
• fuel oil; and
• bitumen.
The only sources of energy produced domestically include solar water 
heaters (SWHs), hydro power plants and a minor solar PV contribution.
In 2010, energy imports accounted for approximately 96.8% of primary 
supply, and only 3.2% was locally produced from hydroelectric power plants 
and SWHs. The share of primary energy imports did not change significantly 
between 2010 and 2015, as political instability in the region prevented 
uninterrupted imports of natural gas, thus forcing various plants to rely on 
fuel oil.
Primary energy production in Lebanon comes from mainly imported oil 
products. In 2016, fuel imports accounted for around 95% of overall energy 
production and imports. Some 96% of the country’s total primary energy 
supply (TPES) in 2017 was sourced from primary and secondary oils, 
followed by coal at 2% (IEA, 2019).
Like other developing countries, Lebanon faces difficulties in compiling 
energy data and therefore is yet to generate a complete energy balance. 
The energy data employed by this study was largely based on two reports 
published by the Lebanese Centre for Energy Conservation (LCEC), namely 
the NREAP 2016–2020 (LCEC, 2016) and The First Energy Indicators Report 
of the Republic of Lebanon (LCEC, 2018).

Figure 4 presents the fuel import mix for Lebanon in 
2018 – calculated based on interviews with the MEW 
– with a total mix of 8 617 thousand tonnes of oil 
equivalent (ktoe).
This high dependence on imported oil products has 
increased the vulnerability of the Lebanese economy 
to oil price fluctuations. In addition, in recent years 
Lebanon has experienced significant intermittency 
of electricity imports owing to regional instability. As 
well as threatening the country’s energy security, this 
has aggravated the electricity supply shortage. In this 
context, the country’s high dependency on imports is a 
strong driver for the deployment of renewable energy 
sources, which will improve Lebanon’s energy security.
As shown in Figure 8, the three dominant resources are 
gasoline, fuel oil and gas oil, which combined represent 
approximately 93% of total oil imports. Most of the 
gasoline is used in the transportation sector, while 
the fuel oil is predominantly consumed by EDL for 
electricity generation, with some consumed by large 
industries for private electricity generation.
Total final energy consumption (TFEC) in 2016 was 
largely met by imported oil and electricity, with the 
highest share being consumed in the transport sector 
(42%), followed by the residential sector (38%) and 
industry (15%).

14%For gas oil (diesel), there are four main areas of 
consumption: electricity generation by EDL, private 
generation, heating in houses, and use in the 
transportation sector – especially for large vehicles. 
However, defining the share of each of these four 
end-use categories represents a challenge, owing to 
analytical limitations.
Liquid gas represents a smaller share of the total mix, 
as it is most often consumed in small heaters or for 
cooking. Kerosene is more or less solely used in the 
transport sector to fuel aircraft, whereas asphalt is used 
in industries or road infrastructure. Figure 8 shows the 
evolution of imports of these products.
The evolution of imports is consistent with each of the 
oil products keeping the same share of total imports. In 
2019, total imports reached 8 618 ktoe, representing a 
financial burden of around USD 6 248 million. Moreover, 
in 2019, an additional 350 ktoe of petroleum coke was 
imported, although this is not reflected in Figure 8 
owing to incomplete information regarding its origin of 
and use.

Institutional framework
The Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) is the main 
stakeholder in the energy sector in Lebanon. It is 
essentially responsible for the country’s electricity, 
water and oil portfolios, particularly at the strategic and 
planning levels in these areas. 
The long-established Lebanese Centre for Energy 
Conservation (LCEC) has evolved to become the 
national energy agency. The LCEC is affiliated to the 
Lebanese Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) and 
is the technical arm of the Ministry in all subjects 
related to energy efficiency, renewable energy and 
green buildings. The LCEC offers proven expertise and 
supports the Lebanese government in developing and 
implementing national strategies to save energy and 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Electricite du Liban (EDL) is the vertically integrated 
company that manages the entire electricity sector in 
terms of generation, transmission and distribution. In 
2010, the government introduced distribution service 
providers (DSPs) to open the door for private–public 
partnerships (PPP) in the distribution sector. 
The scope of the DSPs covered network survey; asset 
management; customer service; construction of new 
feeders and substations; rehabilitation of existing 
feeders and substations; operation and maintenance 
of all assets in corresponding service zones; inspection 
and violation removal; meter reading and bill collection 
and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI). As of early 
2019, there are three DSPs in operation.

In 2002, Law 462 was presented with the objective 
of reforming the structure of the Lebanese energy 
sector. The law provided for the establishment of the 
Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA) and allocated it 
the authority to grant electricity generation licenses to 
IPPs in order to feed the national grid.
Although Law 462 has been in force since 2002, it 
has never been implemented. Therefore, there is no 
regulatory body to issue licenses for new generation. 
Following an initial emphasis on privatisation in the 
period 1999–2002, the focus shifted towards public–
private partnerships and corporatisation, leaving Law 
462 somewhat outdated.
New laws have since been implemented to better 
reflect current conditions and stimulate the widespread 
adoption of renewable resources.
Law 288, adopted in 2014, further side-lined Law 462 
by indicating that the Council of Ministers (CoM) – upon 
joint recommendations from the MEW and the Ministry 
of Finance (MoF) – could license IPPs. Law 288 was 
applicable for a period of two years (i.e., from April 
2014 to April 2016), but was then extended in 2016 for 
another two years until 2018 under Law 54, despite the 
CoM not having issued any licenses.
In a recently published declaration, the Lebanese 
government said it would extend Law 288 to maintain 
current synergy, particularly within the renewable 
energy sector. As such, this law provided the 
opportunity to conclude a wind PPA contract, allowing 
for private sector entry to the Lebanese electricity 
generation market.
In 2019, the updated electricity policy paper adopted 
by the Lebanese government proposed to parliament 
an amendment of Law 288/2014 (under Law 129) to 
extend its application period for three additional years 
to allow the establishment of an independent electricity 
regulatory authority. This amendment is yet to be 
addressed by the Lebanese parliament.

3. Ongoing power sector reform 
The Lebanese electricity sector has suffered since 
the mid-1990s, primarily due to a lack of investment 
that has led to the sharp deterioration of the sector’s 
infrastructure. Hence, EDL has not been able to satisfy 
national electricity demand alone – a situation that 
has led to the development of smaller private diesel 
generators who operate in an unofficial capacity in a 
parallel electricity market.
The reduction in generation capacity has been 
amplified by poor maintenance and increased demand. 
Indeed, the recent influx of refugees to Lebanon has 
contributed to the increasing gap between electricity 
generation and demand, which reached 7 375 GWh in 
2017 (MEW, 2019c).
The NREAP shows that for the year 2010, EDL thermal 
power plants generated approximately 68% of the total 
estimated electricity demand at around 15 934 GWh. 
Hydropower plants provided around 6% and electricity 
imports from Syria and Egypt provided 3%. The 
remaining 23% was supplied by decentralised private 
diesel generators distributed all over the country. The 
total electricity generated was slightly above 15 000 
GWh, leaving around 900 GWh of electricity demand 
unserved.
More recent data provided by the MEW highlights 
that the addition of several power plants in 2016–2017 
increased overall generation capacity by approximately 
700 MW, helping to close the gap between peak 
demand and installed capacity (MEW, 2019c).

marking an increase of 54.8% since 2010, when demand 
was estimated at 15 934 GWh (LCEC, 2010). However, 
annual electricity demand data adopted by the MEW 
vary between 3.8% and 5%; the difference is essentially 
caused by the demand calculation methodology 
employed by EDL and the demand consequences of the 
significant increase in population over a short period. 
For consistency with MEW data, the updated policy 
paper estimates a demand increase of 3% by 2020.
Table 2 shows existing EDL power plants along with 
their installed and effective capacities. The derating of 
most of these power plants is essentially a result of their 
age and maintenance needs.

key part of the country’s recovery plans.Source: IRENA, 2019a
Figure 12: Global weighted average total installed costs and project percentile ranges for CSP, solar 
 PV, onshore and offshore wind, 2010–2018
In addition, Table 2 shows the corresponding generation 
cost of each of these power plants. The new power 
plant at Zouk have the lowest cost of 10.83 US cents 
per kWh, whereas in the case of the Hrayche, Tyr and 
Baalbek power plants, the cost is more than 20 US 
cents per kWh. This highlights the additional benefits 
of deploying renewable energy in Lebanon, along with 
the cost-competitiveness of renewables compared to 
fossil-fuel based sources.
IRENA’s Renewable power generation costs in 2018 
finds that the continued decline in costs for solar PV and 
onshore wind – as well as CSP and offshore wind – will 
lead to renewable power becoming more competitive 
than even the cheapest new source of fossil fuel-fired 
electricity by 2020. 
Figure 12 shows that for IRENA’s auction data for 
utility-scale solar PV, suggests that the average price 
of electricity could fall to USD 0.048/kWh in 2020, a 
reduction of 44% compared to the global weighted 
average LCOE of projects commisioned in 2018. This 
decline is further amplified by the decrease in the cost 
of dispatchable CSP and battery storage technologies, 
improvements in grid operation and an emerging suite 
of electricification technologes in end-uses (from 
electric vehicles to heat pumps).

Figure 13: EDL transmission network 
As of 2010, the developing renewable energy sector has 
been supported by a clearer national action plan, driven 
by the electricity reform paper (Bassil, 2010) and the 
first National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP), 
(LCEC, 2010), prepared by the MEW and the LCEC, 
respectively, and adopted by the Lebanese government.
On 8 April 8, 2019, the then Lebanese government 
adopted the update to the electricity reform paper 
prepared by the MEW in collaboration with the World 
Bank. This plan relied on the 2010 action plan but 
introduced changes to some of the approaches adopted 
in previous versions.
The plan began by addressing the causes of the 
electricity problem in Lebanon that were summarised 
as follows: 
• Tariffs: tariffs have been fixed in Lebanon since 
1994 at an average of USD 0.092 per kWh, 
corresponding to an oil price of USD 20 per barrel, 
while not taking into consideration fluctuating oil 
prices, which rose to more than USD 140 per barrel 
in 2008 and significantly increased EDL’s financial 
deficit.
• High operation costs: Power plants in Lebanon 
rely mainly on heavy fuel oil and diesel oil, thus 
increasing their generation cost in comparison to 
natural gas. Moreover, the newest power plants in 
Deir Ammar and Zahrani were originally meant to 
be operated using natural gas, but are currently 
using diesel, increasing their generation cost and 
leading to negative environmental impacts.
• Old power plants with low efficiency: These 
require significant maintenance, decreasing their 
operational availability.
• High technical losses: Both transmission and 
distribution grids face losses equivalent to 16.5% 
despite recent efforts by the Ministry, EDL and the 
distribution service providers (DSP) to rehabilitate 
the underdeveloped grid, as shown in Figure 13.
• High non-technical losses: These have reached 21%, 
largely owing to violations and illegal connections 
to the distribution grid that EDL is seemingly 
incapable of addressing.
• Uncollected bills: This are estimated at around 5%, 
and sometimes as high as 30% due to strikes by EDL 
and DSPs employees, in addition to uncollected 
electricity revenues from public institutions and 
refugee camps estimated at USD 1.820 billion and 
USD 444 million, respectively.
• Impacts of regional crises: The Lebanese Crisis 
Response Plan (LCRP) 2017–2020 estimated that 
the refugee crisis has cut electricity availability 
by 500 MW – equivalent to approximately five 
hours of electricity per day – obliging the state to 
rely more on private generators, costing around 
USD 150 million USD (UNDP, 2016).

JbailTo remedy these factors, in the updated electricity 
reform paper the Ministry proposed the following 
potential solutions:
Decreasing technical and non-technical losses and 
increasing EDL financial income
To achieve a decrease in technical losses, the MEW 
proposed a series of practical actions beginning with 
the implementation of the transmission sector master 
plan adopted by the Lebanese government in 2017. 
It proposed that this be complemented by a series 
of projects to alleviate transmission bottlenecks in 
several locations. In the distribution sector, DSPs have 
committed to reduce distribution technical losses 
through grid rehabilitation. Combined, the proposed 
actions will potentially reduce technical losses from 
around 16.5% in 2018 to less than 8% in 2022. 
A campaign was also launched by MEW to remove 
illegal connections, thereby lowering non-technical 
losses from 21% in 2018 to around 3% in 2021.
In 2019, EDL began installing smart electricity meters 
as part of its advanced metering infrastructure project 
to add more than one million meters across Lebanon by 
2022. These meters will allow EDL to introduce modern 
electricity services while monitoring and lowering nontechnical losses.
Combining both actions related to grid losses would 
allow EDL to lower total losses from around 34% in 2018 
to less than 11% in 2022, enabling a saving of around 
USD 640 million during the period 2018–2021.
Moreover, addressing the losses will increase EDL cash 
flow by more than USD 2 billion over this period through 
the following actions:
• Collection of existing uncollected bills:
 USD 182 million; 
• Updating the collection process of EDL bills:
 USD 370 million; 
• Collection of electricity bills from refugee camps:
 USD 296 million; 
• Collection of outstanding bills from public 
institutions: USD 1.213 billion; 
Increasing generation capacity, improving efficiency 
and reducing costs by switching to natural gas
The plan proposed to increase the generation capacity 
of EDL by combining both short term temporary 
solutions with long term permanent solutions – 
installing 1 450 MW of temporary generation combined 
with around 3 100 MW of permanent generation.
This increase in generation capacity will allow EDL to 
close the gap between electricity supply and demand, 
thereby reducing dependency on private generators 
by 2020, reducing the electricity bill for consumers 
and supporting the Lebanese economy by providing a 
reliable, low-cost electricity supply.
Decreasing EDL’s generation costs will alleviate its 
financial deficit and generate national economic 
benefits by adding new higher efficiency power plants 
and removing old, expensive and inefficient ones with 
high maintenance costs. 
Moreover, to further lower generation costs and 
environmental impacts, the MEW plans to introduce 
natural gas starting in mid-2021 in most of its power 
plants by installing floating storage and regasification 
units. Meanwhile, the MEW will allow IPPs to procure 
their own fuel during the transition phase, which may 
introduce natural gas to the power generation sector 
even earlier.
Increasing tariffs
In Lebanon, consumers are issued with two electricity 
bills with separate tariffs: one for EDL and the other for 
the private generators that complement EDL’s supply. 
Private diesel generators issue bills in accordance with a 
tariff issued by the MEW, which is updated on a monthly 
basis. EDL generation costs were estimated in 2018 at 
USD 0.14 per kWh, which is far higher than the average 
cost estimated at 0.092 per kWh. The tariff from private 
diesel generators is USD 0.264 per kWh. The MEW has 
been working with the World Bank to propose a new 
pricing structure that will include an increase in tariffs 
based on the expected increase in consumption.Photograph: Shutterstock3. RENEWABLE ENERGY 
STATUS, TARGETS 
AND POLICIES
1. Overview
Renewable energy sources have largely been limited to biomass heating in 
rural areas and hydroelectric power plants installed before the 1970s that 
represented more than 75% of the electricity produced in Lebanon at that 
time. 
As per Table 3, total installed hydroelectric capacity is 286 MW; however, 
several plants lack proper maintenance, which has led to reduced efficiency 
and production losses of around 30–40%. Most of these power plants belong 
to the water concessions in Lebanon, where the currently adopted tariff of 
USD 0.1 per kWh, does not constitute sufficient motive for these institutions 
to properly maintain the plants.
Today, most of the newly added renewable energy installations are in the 
power sector – mostly decentralised solar rooftop PV, which is estimated 
to have increased from 330 kWp in 2010 to 56.37 MWp in 2018, generating 
around 83.5 GWh in the same year (LCEC, 2019c). While all end-use sectors 
are important to address, the focus is on the power sector due to the widening 
electricity deficit, coupled with the need for greater energy security.

and policy framework
Targets
In 2018, the Prime Minister announced a renewable 
target of 30% of electricity consumed by 2030, as 
reflected in the latest electricity reform paper adopted 
by the Lebanese government in 2019. 
Prior to 2018, the government had set a renewable 
energy target of 12% of total primary energy consumed 
(electricity and heating) by 2020. In this regard, in 2015, 
the MEW and LCEC decided to dedicate a separate 
document to presenting the proposed goals and 
actions to meet these ambitious targets – the National 
Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) (LCEC, 2016).
Moreover, Lebanon ratified the Paris Agreement in 
Parliament under law 115 in March 2019; so, despite these 
circumstances, renewable energy commitments were 
made as part of its Nationally Determined Contribution 
(NDCs) to the Paris Agreement.
Lebanon’s NDC includes both unconditional and 
conditional renewable energy targets. Unconditional 
targets include meeting 15% of power and heating 
demand using renewable energy sources by 2030, while 
conditional targets include satisfying an additional 5% 
of power and heating requirements from renewable 
energysources. Thus, the current NDC aims for a total 
share of 20% by 2030.
The national action plan on renewable energy
The foundations of renewable energy planning were 
introduced in the 2010 electricity reform paper (Bassil, 
2010) and expanded in the first National Energy 
Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) for Lebanon (LCEC, 
2010) that combined both renewable energy and energy 
efficiency initiatives. In 2015, separate action plans were 
adopted for renewables and energy efficiency covering 
the period 2016–2020.
The first NEEAP for Lebanon introduced fourteen 
initiatives in 2010 related to renewable energy and 
energy efficiency, combined. The most successful was 
initiative 11, which introduced the National Energy 
Efficiency and Renewable Energy Action (NEEREA) 
dedicated to distributed solar applications.
The NEEAP 2010–2015 (and then 2016–2020) has been 
in effect since 2011 and has acted as the governing 
framework for the deployment of renewable energy 
in Lebanon. The NREAP 2016–2020 placed emphasis 
on certain renewable technologies over others. The 
following sections highlight the current resource 
availability and development potential for various 
renewable energy sources in Lebanon, along with the 
corresponding projects in the pipeline for 2030.
The NREAP 2016–2020 was presented in November 
2016 by the MEW through the LCEC. It outlines a 
strategic plan for the renewable energy sector that aims 
to achieve the set renewables target of 12% of consumed 
primary energy for both electricity generation and 
heating purposes by 2020.
The NREAP relied on a 2010 baseline to estimate the 
primary energy consumed for electricity generation 
and heating at around 6 069 ktoe. Based on this 
figure, consumption in 2020 was estimated at 6 389 
ktoe, which meant that the target was to produce the 
equivalent of 767 ktoe from renewable sources by 2020.
To achieve this, the methodology adopted focused on 
estimating the available potential of relatively mature 
renewable energy sources by building three different 
scenarios: optimistic, realistic and pessimistic. Based 
on a partial substitution methodology, the renewable 
energy mix was optimised to achieve the target mix 
presented in Figure 14, leading to the targeted installed 
capacities illustrated in Figure 15.

 and driving policy instruments
Hydropower
Hydropower was the first form of renewable energy 
to be deployed in Lebanon and plays a major role in 
supplying renewable electricity to the country. However, 
low contracted prices and lack of maintenance and/
or refurbishment of hydropower plants have led to 
a continuous drop in the share of hydropower in the 
energy mix.
The main potential of hydropower in Lebanon is derived 
from four main sources: rehabilitation of existing power 
plants; construction of new power plants; microhydro run-of-river applications; and generation from 
non-river sources. The NREAP 2016–2020 finds that 
rehabilitation of existing power plants can help increase 
their annual generation by more than 1 000 GWh. With 
the construction of new power plants, the available 
potential is estimated at around 368 MW in the peak 
scheme and 263 MW in the run-of-river scheme 
(Sogreah-Artelia, 2012). The last source of hydropower 
potential derives from micro-hydro and non-river 
sources estimated to be around 5 MW (CEDRO, 2013).
The announced targets within the NREAP, as shown 
in Table 4, are 331.5 and 473 MW in 2020 and 2030, 
respectively, including existing power plants to be 
rehabilitated.

Hydroelectricity 331.5 MW 473 MW N.A. 300 MW Additional 382–487 
MWIn March 2018, the MEW launched an expression of 
interest (EOI) for the installation of hydroelectric power 
plants on various Lebanese rivers. The MEW received 
25 EOIs from 59 companies from 15 different countries 
to install more than 300 MW.
The main challenge lies in the fact that most of the 
existing concessions, except for the Litani River Authority 
concessions, are used exclusively for agricultural and 
irrigation purposes rather than hydropower generation. 
To promote hydropower in these concessions, the 
Lebanese government delegated the MEW to negotiate 
concessions as per the newly adopted electricity plan 
in 2019 to find an appropriate solution for the current 
situation.
Onshore wind
The initial evaluation of wind potential in Lebanon 
began in 2011 with the publication of the wind atlas 
(Garrad Hassan, 2011) that estimated a mean wind 
capacity potential of 6 100 MW. According to the LCEC, 
while considering assumptions on installation density, 
minimum wind speed requirement and maximum 
slope constraints, this potential must be decreased to
5 400 MW with a generation capacity of 12 139 GWh, 
resulting in available potential of 1 500 MW. 
IRENA’s assessment conducted exclusively for this 
report in 2019 presents a slightly higher potential of 
6 233 MW. The assessment is based on the Agency’s 
suitability mapping approach, which scores each 1 
km2 parcel of land on resource quality, proximity to 
transmission lines, topography, population density, 
protected areas and land cover. Results from this 
assessment conducted at 100 m height indicate that 
over 1 558 km2 of land in Lebanon is suitable for utility 
scale wind farms. This translates to around 6 233 MW of 
wind capacity.
The NREAP has set wind targets at 200 MW and 450 MW 
in 2020 and 2030, respectively, with approximate 
investment needs of USD 490 million in 2020. Table 
5 outlines the targets for 2020 and 2030, along with 
contracted capacity and projects in the pipeline as of 
2019.

The main policy instrument driving wind deployment is 
competitive procurement, or auctions. The first round 
was launched in 2013 when developers were invited to 
bid for the licenses to develop three wind farms in the 
under-developed region of Akkar, totalling a capacity 
of between 200 and 220 MW, depending on the wind 
turbines employed.
The contracted price, after several rounds of 
negotiations, dropped from more than USD 0.14 per 
kWh to USD 0.1045 per kWh for the first three years 
and USD 0.096 per kWh for the remaining seventeen 
years of the contract. This price included land leasing, 
obtaining licenses, financing and insurance costs, and 
the cost of the transformation stations,and the cost 
of the transformation stations, with any required grid 
reinforcement to be considered as client assets.1
The second round of auctions was launched through 
an expression of interest (EOI) in April 2018, receiving 
42 offers from 74 companies representing 21 countries 
with an estimated capacity around 4 000 MW, while 
the required capacity was between 200 and 400 
MW. The Request for Proposals (RfPs) for the project 
were released to companies that submitted their 
interest during the International Beirut Energy Forum 
held in Beirut in September 2018. Figure 18 shows the 
total capacity received in each region of Lebanon, 
according to the Wind Atlas (GH, 2011), with the highest 
concentration being in the Akkar region.

Analysing 2016, many factors shape the prices that 
emerge from auctions, but they may be grouped into 
four categories (Figure 20):
1) country-specific conditions such as resource 
availability and the costs of finance, land and labour;
2) the degree of investor confidence (availability of 
clear targets, credible off-taker);
3) other policies related to renewable energy (grid 
policies, priority dispatch, local content rules); and
4) the design of the auction itself, taking into 
consideration the trade-offs between obtaining the 
lowest price and achieving other objectives.

 in auction designSolar power
Lebanon had a cumulative installed solar PV capacity of 
just 56.37 MW at the end of 2018 (LCEC 2019d), including 
large-scale projects and distributed installations. 
IRENA’s Global Atlas for Renewable Energy (see Figure 
20) indicates that annual average solar irradiation in 
Lebanon ranges between 1 520 kWh/m2/year and 
2 148 kWh/m2/year, with a significant majority of areas 
being above 1 900 kWh/m2/year.
Building on this solar irradiation data, IRENA estimates 
that the potential for utility scale solar PV could reach 
182 GW. The estimate is based on the Agency’s suitability 
mapping approach, which scores each 1 km2 parcel of 
land on resource quality, proximity to transmission lines, 
topography, population density, protected areas and 
land cover. The results of this assessment, conducted 
specifically for this report, indicate that over 5 558 km2 
of land in Lebanon is suitable for utility scale solar PV, 
having scored above 65%. 
Based on a PV land-use footprint of 33 MW/km2, this 
translates to around 182 615 MW of solar PV capacity. 
This estimate was found to be more than twice that of 
prior assessments by NREAP, at 87 000 MW.

i. Grid-connected large-scale solar PV
The threshold for large scale solar PV adopted in the 
NREAP is 1 MWp. Therefore, the targets in the following 
sections relating to centralised installations have a 
capacity equal to, or more than, this threshold.
The significant solar PV resource potential shows that 
the limitations to this technology largely comprise 
economic, grid infrastructure and management, land, 
social and environmental constraints. According to the 
NREAP, the national solar PV targets are 150 MWp and 
300 MWp in 2020 and 2030, respectively.
The deployment of large-scale solar PV projects is 
driven by competitive procurement either via the 
engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) 
model – whereby a private company installs the project 
and hands it over to EDL for operation – or the power 
purchase agreement (PPA) model, whereby private 
developers are invited to bid for a 20-year contract to 
sell power to EDL. 
The first project installed in Lebanon was the Beirut 
River Solar Snake (BRSS), initiated by the MEW in 2013 
with the aim of installing a PV farm of more than 1 MWp 
on the bed of the Beirut river. The demonstration 
project of 1.08 MWp was highly significant, having 
proved the feasibility of large-scale solar PV in Lebanon 
and thereby contributed to de-risking the sector. 
The BRSS project was developed following an EPC 
model and transferred to EDL in 2016 through the 
signature of an operation and maintenance services 
contract for two successive years. EDL launched a bid 
at the end of 2018 to install the second phase of the 
BRSS project, with a capacity of more than 7 MWp. The 
results of the bid are expected by December 2019, and 
the project to be commissioned in the first half of 2020.
Following the BRSS, the second project within the 
1 MWp capacity formed part of the first phase of the 
Zahrani Oil Installations, under the umbrella of a broader 
3 MWp target that aims to satisfy the full energy needs 
of the installations.
In early 2017, Lebanon adopted the first auction for 
solar PV. The MEW launched an expression of interest to 
install 12 PV farms, each with a capacity of 10 to 15 MW, 
in the four main regions of Lebanon. In response to 
the bid, LCEC and the MEW received 265 expressions 
of interest resulting in a total capacity of more than 
3 500 MWp, while the bids aimed at capacities ranging 
between 120 to 180 MW. Another request for proposals 
was launched in May 2017; it elicited 42 offers by the 
end of October of 2017, presented by 138 companies 
from 26 different countries. The first evaluation phase 
concluded in early 2019 qualified 28 companies to the 
final phase before financial evaluation, with the lowest 
bid price received at 5.7 US cents/Kwh (MEW, 2019a). 
The highest concentration of projects and capacities 
were in the Bekaa and Hermel regions due to their 
higher irradiances (approximately 20% or more) and 
lower land prices (see Figure 21).

In 2018, the MEW and LCEC launched an EOI to install 
three PV farms of 100 MWp capacity combined with a 
minimum storage capacity of 70 MWh each. The project 
is considered to be one of the largest of its kind and 
constituted an important milestone for the renewable 
energy sector in Lebanon. The EOI was initiated in March 
2018, receiving 75 offers in July by 148 companies from 
33 countries. The offered capacity reached 4 268 MWp, 
while the required capacity was only 300 MWp. 
Figure 23 shows the distribution of capacities per 
region, where the highest potential for solar PV is in the 
Bekaa region, for the reasons explained above.
The MEW and LCEC are preparing for the launch of the 
second round of PV auctions to install 24 farms with a 
total capacity of 240–360 MWp before the end of 2020.
Moreover, the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (EBRD) has launched a feasibility study 
for a solar PV project with a capacity of 300–500 MW 
in the Tufail region based on a study from the American 
University in Beirut (AUB) that has identified 10–15 
km2 of land with high solar radiation which would be 
suitable for solar projects (AUB, 2019).2

258Figure 24: Installed capacity of distributed PV solar systems 
ii. Distributed solar PV
Distributed solar PV, as defined by the NREAP, refers 
to PV systems installed to satisfy the local demand of 
a specific consumer or group of consumers. Distributed 
solar potential is hard to estimate, given the complex 
procedures for evaluating the capacity for rooftop 
installations. A project funded by the National Council 
for Scientific Research estimated the available rooftop 
area to be between 30% and 80% of the total rooftop 
area in Beirut – sufficient area to provide between 13% 
and 34% of the electricity needs of the capital.
Similar to large-scale PV, the potential for distributed 
PV systems remains far above the set targets for this 
technology in the NREAP of 100 MWp and 150 MWp in 
in 2020 and 2030, respectively.
As shown in Table 7, the project pipeline is unclear, 
particularly for plants being developed by the private 
sector, but given that these capacities have risen, an 
increase of 55 MWp can reasonably be estimated by 
2020.
Driven by NEEREA Loans, the private sector has taken 
the lead in promoting distributed PV systems; Figure 24 
shows the evolution of distributed PV systems starting 
at around 0.33 MWp in 2010 and rising to 56.37 MWp 
in 2018.

*Before Remap 2030 ScenarioNEEREA was created in collaboration with the 
central bank of Lebanon (BDL) to provide the private 
sector with long-term loans at low interest rates for 
distributed renewable energy applications or energy 
efficiency projects. NEEREA is the only green financing 
mechanism in the Arab region that has a loan ceiling of 
USD 10 million per project and offers low interest rates 
for periods up to 14 years – including a grace period 
of between six months and four years. These loans are 
provided directly through Lebanese commercial banks 
to end users.
The BDL has issued several circulars to ensure 
the consistency of NEEREA among all Lebanese 
commercial banks. As per Intermediate Circular 236, 
Lebanese commercial banks can free some of their 
required reserves at the central bank to finance NEEREA 
projects. Following Circular 236, the sustainability of 
the NEEREA financing mechanism was further secured 
by circulars 313, 318, 346 and 515, among others.
NEEREA has witnessed rapid growth and broad 
acceptance among the public, despite the barriers 
and instability in the energy sector. NEEREA loans 
are becoming increasingly popular products in the 
Lebanese banking sector, with more than 938 projects 
worth more than USD 560 million financed as of March 
2019 (see Figure 25).
Out of the total number of projects funded by NEEREA, 
most of them included solar PV rooftop installations, 
reaching approximately 621 projects out of the 938 
projects financed as of March 2019. 
However, despite its successful implementation, the 
NEEREA financing mechanism has several constraints, 
particularly when applied to large-scale renewable 
energy projects, as it is designed to only finance 
renewable energy projects for own consumption and 
not for IPP purposes.
Following these private sector developments, the 
public sector launched a project to install PV systems 
in 10 public buildings. Table 8 presents the location of 
each installation, its size and status.

19The MEW also installed around 4 000 PV of public 
street lighting systems with an installed total capacity 
of around 1.2 MWp. In addition, the Ministry of 
Education and Higher Education is also taking part in 
the development of distributed PV systems by installing 
113 PV stations that include battery storage.
Another example of a private sector distributed PV 
system is the project implemented by the Council for 
Development and Reconstruction (CDR), where 800 
PV street lighting poles were installed with a capacity 
of around 24 kWp, combined with 11 stations for PV 
pumping in the Baalbek region with a total capacity of 
1.4 MWp.
The driving force behind all these initiatives has been 
the falling cost of technology. IRENA estimates that 
the price of solar PV modules has fallen by around 90% 
since the end of 2009 (IRENA, 2019b).

PV module price by technology and manufacturer in 
the period January 2010–July 2018 (top) and average

for distributed capacities within the Lebanese market

3 Net metering is a financial agreement in which utility customers generate some of their own electricity and use a single meter to 
measure the net electricity bought from the utility. At various times, the customer will not use all the electricity generated. The excess 
is fed back into the grid and makes the meter run backwards. When the meter is read, it will usually show a net purchase from the 
utility. If, for some reason, the customer generated more electricity than was consumed that month and the meter shows a negative 
value, it will be read as zero or credited to the next month’s bill. In effect, during a single billing period, the customer uses any excess 
generation to offset electricity that they would have had to purchase at the retail tariff.
4 The main objective of CEDRO 4 is the application of renewable energy and energy efficiency systems and measures across 
Lebanon’s several economic sectors (commercial, industrial, utility-scale, a demonstration project on a village scale, and bioenergysourced heating) and beneficiaries. Ultimately, CEDRO 4 will continue to benefit from the on-going assistance provided by the UNDP 
to the Government of Lebanon to develop and implement a national sustainable energy strategy to mitigate climate change, in line 
Figure 27 shows that prices for most distributed 
PV applications have fallen worldwide. For hybrid 
applications – systems connected to the electricity 
grid with backup battery storage – prices have 
reached around USD 1 200 per kWp. Off-grid systems 
experienced the largest decrease in price of almost 
46%, from above USD 5 000 per kWp in 2013 to around 
USD 3 000 in 2017. 
For on-grid applications with batteries – systems 
connected to the grid with backup battery storage 
– prices in the market dropped from around USD 6 
000 per kWp in 2013 to around USD 3 300 in 2017, 
representing a 39% decrease. Both systems have 
relatively higher prices than on-grid and solar pumping 
systems owing to their use of battery storage.
The price of on-grid with grid-tied systems fell from 
USD 3 700 per kWp in 2013 to 1 400 in 2017, marking an 
almost 57% decrease in price, while solar PV pumping 
experienced an expansion, leading to a reduction in 
prices of about 50% between 2014 and 2016, mainly due 
to the number of installations and their size. Moreover, 
all these prices were based on estimations made using 
NEEREA data that represents costs higher than regular 
market prices due to financing and study costs.
Other instruments supporting the deployment of 
distributed PV systems include public investments in 
government owned property and the net-metering 
scheme. 
In 2011, net-metering3
 was introduced in Lebanon 
through a decision from the EDL board that was 
approved by the MEW, with the involvement of MEW 
advisors, the LCEC team, and the CEDRO project of the 
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 4
Net-metering offered the first opportunity to connect 
renewable energy projects to the national grid. 
Although more than 50 projects are already connected 
to the network, several limitations exist due to the lack 
of meters at EDL and the manual methods used to 
calculate net excess amounts of monthly rollover for 
one year before returning the meter to zero.

Currently, the LCEC in collaboration with MEW and with 
the support of the EBRD, are preparing a law allowing 
for the introduction of collective net metering and 
power wheeling which may help the development of 
renewables in Lebanon.
In addition to the efforts of local authorities and 
the private sector, the World Bank’s Energy Sector 
Management Assistance Programme (ESMAP) has 
launched a global project to analyse rooftop solar 
potential based on stereo-satellite imagery in 14 cities 
across Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.
The goal of this data collection exercise is to create 
a methodology that could be replicated in any 
jurisdiction worldwide at low cost through machine 
learning efficiencies. The World Bank expressed an 
interest in leveraging IRENA’s considerable experience 
gained from creating the rooftop solar city simulator 
(SolarCityEngine) for Kasese, Uganda and Zhangjiakou, 
China to collaborate on the 14-city project. Among 
these cities, the World Bank has identified Beirut as 
being key to implementation efforts. 
Solar water heaters
Solar water heaters (SWHs) were the first renewable 
energy application to be introduced in the last decade 
within the framework of energy efficiency under the 
first NREAP 2011–2015. Surveyed installations in the 
period 2005–2015 are shown in Figure 28.
As shown in Table 9, the targets in the NREAP 2016–2020 
were 1 053 988 m2
 in 2020 and 1 716 835 m2 in 2030. The 
evolution shown in Figure 28 reflects a declining growth 
trend, which will need to be taken into consideration in 
the coming years to reactivate the market and to regain 
the growth momentum of previous years. In this regard, 
Figure 28 shows a decrease in the financing of SWHs 
in the years 2012–2015, accompanied by a reduction in 
SWHs installed.
NEEREA loans and the incentives offered by the MEW 
– with USD 200 cashback on SWHs – have played 
an important role in the development of this market. 
Therefore, stakeholders will need to maintain incentives 
to keep boosting SWH proliferation, given its key role in 
achieving national energy targets.

 ENERGY ROADMAP
 (REMAP) 
The previous sections have outlined the energy context in Lebanon and provided 
a view of how the country’s energy landscape is likely to evolve over the coming 
years based on government plans and targets and the country’s energy strategy, 
including the NREAP (both 2016–2020 and 2016–2020 editions). IRENA’s 
REmap analysis, which is the focus of this section, provides an outlook for the 
potential of renewable energy in the country to 2030. It also highlights areas or 
sectors where the use of renewables could be scaled up.
This section first briefly presents developments that are likely to occur in what is 
termed the ‘reference case 2030’, which is based on current pipelined projects, 
market trends and forecasts. Next, it explores the accelerated potential of 
renewable energy beyond what is expected to occur in the reference case. These 
are called the ‘REmap options’, addressing the end-use sectors of industry, 
buildings and transport, and power generation. The resulting high-share-ofrenewables case is called the ‘REmap case’. 
The REmap analysis for Lebanon extends to the year 2030, chosen as a standard 
medium-term assessment timeframe and a year featured in a variety of global 
targets, such as the United Nations-endorsed Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs). Figure 29 provides an overview of the key cases discussed in this 
chapter and the years that are highlighted.
The country analysis aligns 
with global sustainable 
development goalsFigure 29: Overview of the REmap approach
The steps involved in the REmap analysis for Lebanon 
presented in this chapter include:
• The definition of a base year selected to be the year 
2014 due to data availability.
• The definition of a reference case 2030.
• The definition of a REmap case 2030.
A reference case 2030 is developed to present a view 
of a baseline scenario. This case represents possible 
developments in the energy system given the existing 
measures to support renewable energy deployment in 
Lebanon. The reconciled energy balance for the baseyear 2014 is projected to develop the reference case for 
2030. The projections are essentially based on the most 
recent national plans and commitments of the Lebanese 
government, including the NREAP (2016–2020), the 
second NEEAP (2016–2020) and pipelined renewable 
energy projects. Following a sectorial bottom-up 
approach, the reference case is built by projecting 
each energy carrier under each sector presented in the 
base year, in line with corresponding planned national 
projects and policies. 
Based on the reference case, additional renewable 
energy deployment options are assessed. These are 
called REmap options and are based in part on country 
consultation, including analysis by energy experts from 
LCEC and consultations via workshops with Lebanese 
experts. The result of this option analysis is the REmap 
case, which details the potential of renewables and what 
this implies in terms of technological developments, 
including costs and benefits. Notably, the REmap case 
also provides a view of where the additional potential 
of renewable energy outside the power sector lies; 
i.e. in the end-use sectors of buildings, industry and 
transportand for energy services related to heatfuels 
The REmap case is built from the reference case to reach 
a 30% renewable energy share in the total consumption 
of electricity in 2030 by mapping the projected demand 
for electricity in the end-use sectors. This REmap 
analysis focuses primarily on the power sector due 
to the relatively large potential of renewables. It also 
proposes a synergy between renewable technologies 
in both the transport and building sectors from one 
side, and energy efficiency measures in the buildings 
and industry sectors on the other. The detailed analysis 
and findings for both the reference case and the REmap 
case will be discussed below. 
End-use sectors
The starting point of the analysis is to estimate the 
energy demand in three main end-use sectors, namely, 
buildings, transport and industry. Demand projections 
are estimated starting from the energy balance of the 
base-year 2014 and use compound annual growth rates 
(CAGRs) for the different energy carriers in each enduse sector. The agricultural sector was not explicitly 
considered in the analysis as most of the energy demand 
in this sector is captured under fuels for transport, and 
due to the lack of more detailed information of other 
energy uses.
Renewable energy laws 
require an appropriate 
institutional framework 
and administrative 
capacity, including an 
independent regulator

Buildings
In the buildings sector, final energy consumption 
grows from 72 petajoules (PJ) in the base year to 128 
PJ in the reference case, mainly driven by electricity 
consumption which grows from 55 PJ in the base year 
to 95 PJ in the reference case. Oil and oil products come 
in second place and grow from 16 PJ in the base year to 
26 PJ in the reference case.
In the reference case, the existing plans and policies 
include energy efficiency measures and an increase in 
solar water heater implementation. The deployment 
of solar thermal technologies grows from 0.99 PJ in 
the base year to 4.16 PJ in the reference case. Another 
significant difference between the reference case and 
the base year is an increase in biomass consumption 
for space heating which rises from nearly zero in the 
base year to 2.53 PJ in the reference case. The direct 
renewable energy share5
 in final energy consumption 
in buildings grows from 1.4% in the base year to 5.4% in 
the reference case. 
In addition to the measures already included in the 
existing plans and policies, the REmap case proposes a 
reduction in the final energy consumption of oil and oil 
products from 26 PJ in the reference case to 23 PJ in the 
REmap case by the promotion of electric cooking and 
heat pumps for water and space heating.
Despite adding electricity demand through the 
use of heat pumps and electric cooking, electricity 
consumption remains roughly the same at 95 PJ in 
both the reference case and in the REmap case due to 
the estimated energy efficiency improvements in new 
buildings, the additional promotion of SWHs, and high 
energy efficient heat pumps replacing electric boilers 
and heaters. Therefore, the share of renewables in 
the final energy consumption of the buildings sector 
increases from 5.4% in the Reference case to 6% in the 
REmap case.

5 Renewable energy share in this context is defined as the ratio of the renewable energy used to the total energy used, including only Transport
In the reference case, the demand for transport services 
experiences a significant increase, mainly driven by 
population growth. The final energy consumption of oil 
and oil products in transport grows from 97 PJ in the 
base year to 130 PJ in the reference case. Due to the 
lack of clear plans for public transport and alternative 
fuels in the reference case, the demand increase is 
assumed to be met by oil and oil products.
In the REmap case, 2 PJ of biofuels and 0.46 PJ of 
electric vehicles are introduced. This translates into a 
modest but promising renewable share of 1.7% of final 
energy consumption in the transport sector and reduces 
the consumption of oil and oil products from 130 PJ to 
128 PJ. The use of biofuels corresponds to a 5% volumebased mix of bioethanol – mainly imported – in gasoline 
used by passenger cars, which could potentially also 
bring cost savings from the replacement of fossil-based 
octane enhancers.
The deployment of electric vehicles corresponds 
to shifting 3% of the passenger kilometre (pKm) of 
passenger cars to electric vehicles. The introduction 
of electric vehicles leads to a reduction in the final 
energy consumption in transport, despite the growth 
in demand for transport services. This is mainly due to 
the energy efficiency improvements that result from 
electric vehicles compared to internal combustion 
engined vehicles.

TFEC in transport sector (PJ)Industry
The Lebanese industrial sector in general has not 
experienced significant growth in recent years. Based 
on available data, the annual growth rate for thermal 
and electrical consumption is considered to be 0.1% 
for all industries except for the cement industry, where 
an annual growth of around 2.4% in cement deliveries
was detected.6 Accordingly, the growth of final energy 
consumption in industry is mainly driven by cement 
production. The consumption of oil and oil products for 
thermal purposes grows from 32 PJ in the base year to 
around 40 PJ both in the reference and REmap cases, 
while electricity consumption grows from 15 PJ in the 
base year to 16 PJ in both the reference and REmap 
cases.

TFEC of industrial sector (PJ)TOTAL FINAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION (TFEC)
The sum of final energy consumption in the buildings, 
transport and industry sectors results in the total final 
energy consumption (TFEC). Figure 33 shows the 
evolution of the total final energy consumption in the 
end-use sectors for the base year 2014, the reference 
case and the REmap Case. The final energy consumption 
per usage is detailed for the three cases in Figure 34.
In the base year, the industrial sector, led by the cement 
industry, has a share of 21.5% in TFEC. This is followed by 
the buildings sector at 33.5%, and the transport sector 
at 45%. In the reference case, the transport sector leads 
with the highest share of 41.3% in TFEC, followed by 
the building sector at 40.7%, and the industrial sector 
at 18%. Figure 35 shows that the shares remain roughly 
the same in the REmap case.

Detailed TFEC in end use sectors (PJ)The power sector
Given the base case and the projections for electricity 
demand in industry, transport and buildings discussed 
above, the demand for electricity grows accordingly 
from 70 PJ in the base year to 111 PJ in the reference 
case. In the REmap case, the consumption of electricity 
is also around 111 PJ, almost the same as in the reference 
case. The energy mix in the REmap case proposed in 
the following sections will meet this demand of 111 PJ.
The updated policy paper for the electricity sector 
considers a CAGR of 3% coupled with a drop of 8% in 
the total energy demand assumed in 2020 after the 
expected tariff increase. To meet that demand, the 
projection of the installed capacity of grid integrated 
renewables is given a priority due to the large potential 
in question. 
Transmission and distribution losses are assumed to 
improve significantly both in the reference case and 
in the REmap case, moving from 16.5% in losses in the 
base year to 8% in the reference case and the REmap 
case. These improvements would be the result of the 
much-needed investments in the transmission and 
distribution network that are deemed to take place in 
the reference case.
Wind
Following the signature of the first wind energy PPA 
in the country, the first wind farm of 226 MW paved 
the way for another wind farm project of 200–400 MW 
under the same PPP scheme. Accordingly, the pipeline 
of projects for wind energy suggest that the total 
installed capacity of wind farms would reach around 
626 MW in the reference case. To keep a diversified 
mix of renewables and considering the feasibility of the 
proposed targets, the total installed capacity of wind 
farms was determined to be 1 000 MW in the REmap 
case, which is less than the 1 500 MW cap for the total 
national feasible potential for that resource. Again, in 
terms of electricity, the generation provided by wind 
farms in the country experiences a tremendous growth 
from almost nothing in the base year to 1 817 GWh in 
the reference case and 2 655 GWh in the REmap case.
Hydropower
With the launch of hydro EOIs, the Ministry of Energy 
and Water has also reserved an important share for 
hydro resources. In fact, 25 economically viable sites 
have been identified with a potential of 233 MW in a 
run-of-river scheme or 315 MW in a peak scheme. Hence, 
by topping up the capacities of some of the 25 new 
sites through the corresponding EOI to the existing 286 
MW, the total installed capacity of hydro power plants 
is expected to reach around 601 MW in the reference 
case and in the REmap case – assuming that all the 
implemented new hydro will be under the peak scheme. 
Revamping of old hydro plants is proposed to raise 
their energy production by 25% in the reference and 
REmap cases. Therefore, the electricity generated by 
hydro resources in the country experiences a noticeable 
growth from 425 GWh in the base year to 1 749 GWh in 
both the reference and REmap cases.
Biomass
Despite having a great potential detailed in the national 
bioenergy strategy for Lebanon, the reference case 
remains conservative in this area due to multiple 
complexities and local constraints. Nevertheless, the 
reference case dedicates a total installed capacity of 
8 MW for bioenergy, specifically biogas generation 
from landfill municipal solid waste (MSW) used solely 
for electricity generation. The REmap case suggests 
another modest 5 MW on top of that from municipal 
wastewater treatment, leading to a total installed 
capacity of 13 MW from biogas power plants and a 
total electricity generation of around 100 GWh in the 
REmap case. Notably, the local biogas generated is 
used exclusively for generating electricitySolar
In the reference case, targeted solar PV capacity is 
expected to reach 1 030 MW, which corresponds to 
the major pipelined projects, all primarily based on 
public–private partnership (PPP) models. On top of 
that, the estimated installed capacity of decentralised 
solar PV projects, mainly driven by national financing 
mechanisms such as NEEREA, is expected to reach 150 
MW. Another major solar related technology, CSP with 
storage, is expected to reach a total installed capacity 
of 100 MW on the same timeline. Accordingly, the total 
installed capacity of solar PV in terms of grid integrated 
farms, including PV with storage, decentralised projects 
and CSP is expected to reach 1 280 MW in the proposed 
reference case. 
In the REmap case, the total proposed capacity for 
solar PV was determined to meet the 30% renewable 
share in electricity consumption after the capacities for 
hydro, biogas and wind were determined as explained 
above. Government targets for hydro have already been 
set to develop all the economically viable locations 
in the country as detailed above. Wind energy was 
considered earlier to keep a diversified renewable mix 
and to promote additional investments in that field. 
However, the energy needed to reach the 30% target 
is covered by solar resources due to its large resource 
potential, lower cost of energy and relatively easier grid 
integration process. Accordingly, the total proposed 
capacity in the REmap case for solar is set at 3 100 MW, 
divided between 2 500 MW of solar PV farms, 500 MW 
of decentralised solar PV and 100 MW of CSP, assuming 
the market can achieve the decentralised solar PV 
target. 
In terms of electricity, the generation provided by solar 
PV resources in the country is expected to experience 
tremendous growth from only 6 GWh in the base year 
to 2 049 GWh in the reference case, and 5 210 GWh 
in the REmap case. For CSP, the amount of electricity 
expected to be generated from the corresponding 
projects is the same in both the reference and REmap 
cases and is estimated to be around 395 GWh, assuming 
it is coupled with energy storage facilities.
Installed capacity and electricity generation
Accordingly, the reference case results in a total 
installed capacity of 2 515 MW from renewables 
compared with a total installed capacity of 4 909 MW 
from conventional centralised generation. The REmap 
case goes beyond this and proposes a total installed 
capacity of around 4 700 MW from renewables, led by 
solar PV. The corresponding details are shown in Figure 
36, noting that the reference and REmap cases consider 
shifting all conventional power plants to natural gas, as 
per the updated policy paper. Notably, the REmap case 
identified a potential reduction in installed conventional 
capacity. 
If renewables are given a priority in generation, 
conventional units will have to ramp down and satisfy 
the remaining demand for electricity. Accordingly, 
the amount of conventional installed capacity can be 
potentially reduced – all else being equal; however, this 
is subject to a detailed dynamic stability analysis to 
ensure that the system will remain stable in the worst 
possible case.

studies, is shown in Figure 37. The electricity output 
from renewables in the reference case results in around 
6 000 GWh or 18.11% of a total of 33 500 GWh. In 
the REmap case, the total electricity generated by 
renewables is around 10 100 GWh or 30.17% of a total of 
33 500 GWh, as detailed in the following charts.

The results of the demand projections in the enduse sectors described above and the primary energy 
demand in the power sector indicate that TPES in 
Lebanon is expected to increase in the reference case, 
as shown in Figure 39. The increase in energy demand 
results in a CAGR of around 2.7% for the total primary 
energy supply from 2014 to 2030. In the reference case, 
the TPES rises from around 311 PJ in 2014 to 477 PJ in 
2030. The total demand for fossil fuels grows from 308 
PJ in 2014 to around 449 PJ in 2030, reflecting a growth 
rate of 2.4% per year.
For the REmap case, the CAGR for the TPES drops 
to 2.3%, where TPES is reduced from 477 PJ in the 
reference case to 450 PJ in the REmap Case, mainly due 
to synergies between renewable energy, electrification7 
and energy efficiency. The total demand for fossil fuels 
is reduced from 448 PJ to around 404 PJ, reflecting a 
growth rate of 1.7% per year from the base year. Figure 
39 summarises and compares the TPES between the 
base year, the reference case and the REmap case. 
The REmap case also reduces the growth in the TPES 
and increases both the quantities and the share of 
renewables in the target year. The share of renewables 
in TPES increases from 6.1% in the reference case to 
10.4% in the REmap case.

The shares of renewable energy that result from the 
analysis are presented in Table 11 and Figure 40. The 
renewable energy policy target of Lebanon is based on 
the share of renewable energy in electricity consumed. 
The REmap case is consistent with the target of 30% 
of renewables in electricity consumed in 2030. The 
share of renewables, including the renewable share of 
electricity, in TFEC increases from the base year in the 
reference case and the REmap case. 
The increase in the share of renewables in TFEC is a result 
of the electrification of end-use sectors using renewable 
electricity, as opposed to direct use of renewables. This 
approach not only simplifies the challenge of increasing 
renewables penetration (since it is based on a single 
carrier – electricity – which is very flexible and can be 
used in diverse end-use applications) but also provides 
significant improvements in energy efficiency on the 
end-use side.

7REMAP COSTS AND BENEFITS
This section focuses on the assessment of the costs 
and benefits of the different identified REmap options 
that were proposed previously in this report, with a 
special focus on the power sector. The methodology 
consists of evaluating different indicators in that 
context, which include costs savings, CO2
 emissions 
avoided, and associated externalities such as the 
social cost of emissions. Infrastructure upgrades are 
undoubtedly needed to safely implement the REmap 
option. These were not included in the analysis for the 
sake of simplicity, since the aim of this section is only to 
highlight the potential benefits rather than propose a 
detailed financial analysis.
Potential savings in the power sector
The cost of the total energy generated by the power 
sector in the reference case is compared to the total cost 
of energy generated in the REmap case – a necessary 
step to compute the true savings based on the same 
amount of produced energy. In other words, the same 
amount of energy would be generated by a different 
mix in the power sector in the REmap case following 
the substitution concept, and the associated benefits 
would be based on the difference in energy generated 
under each technology and its corresponding LCOE.
Since the costs and savings – largely related to fuel 
savings – correspond to the year 2030, the analysis 
proposes a set of scenarios linked to the potential 
savings between the suggested worst case and 
best-case scenarios. The considered variables in the 
sensitivity analysis are mainly: the discount rate affected 
by the economic situation and political stability; fuel 
cost; and the projected capital cost of renewable 
technologies in 2030. Several scenarios are discussed 
based on possible combinations of these variables. 
However, only those that reflect real local conditions 
are retained. Accordingly, worst-case, average-case and 
best-case scenarios were proposed. 
The worst-case scenario would correspond to a low 
fuel price, high discount rate and high capital cost for 
renewables, which results in a low LCOE for conventional 
energy and high LCOE for renewable energy. On the 
other hand, the best-case scenario would correspond 
to a high fuel price, low discount rate and low capital 
cost for renewables, which results in a low LCOE for 
renewable energy and a high LCOE for conventional 
energy. The average-case scenario is proposed based 
on mid-values of the corresponding variables. 
Therefore, the total cost of energy for both cases – 
reference 2030 and REmap 2030 – is estimated under 
each scenario by multiplying the amount of energy from 
each generation technology by the corresponding LCOE, 
with the same discount rate used for both conventional 
and renewable energy. The difference in each case 
would reflect the potential savings from the REmap 
case. The results suggest that the implementation of 
the REmap options in the power sector would save on 
average USD 249 million per year under the averagecase scenario compared with the reference case, as 
shown in Table 12 below. The corresponding detailed 
LCOE under each scenario can be found in Annex 2. 
Table 12 presents the potential savings in the REmap 
case in 2030 compared with the reference case in 
2030. These savings consider only renewable energy 
technologies in the power sector that have different 
amounts of installed capacity in both cases. Hence, CSP 
and hydro are not accounted for in this context, since 
their installed capacity is the same in the reference and 
REmap cases. Power generation from decentralised 
solar PV is assumed to be supplied at zero cost, since it 
mainly comes from private investments on the end-user 
side. The results displayed in Table 12 are rounded to 
the nearest integer.
Ideally, the additional energy provided by renewables 
should replace the energy produced by the most 
expensive units based on their order of merit. Due to the 
variable nature of some renewable resources, however, 
renewable-based generation can have a relatively high 
degree of unpredictability and uncertainty. Renewables, 
therefore, cannot simply be assumed to replace existing 
units.
Renewable-based generation was given priority, 
regardless of time of day, considering that the stability 
of the system would be preserved and the difference 
between the total produced energy in the two cases 
would be considered instead of a technology-specific 
shift. A more in-depth study is, however, required to 
optimise the replacement of energy via unit commitment 
and economic load dispatch analysis coupled with 
specific local constraints and initial conditions.
In addition to cost savings in the power sector, initial 
savings from energy efficiency measures proposed in 
the REmap case are also identified. As expected, the 
buildings sector is the main source of these savings on 
the end-user side and has an aggregate total potential 
of around 377.42 GWh of electricity avoided – estimated 
to be equivalent to around USD 46.13 million of savings 
per year. These savings are already reflected in the 
power sector as shown in Table 12.Emissions reduction and externalities
The REmap case provides important benefits related to 
air pollution and social costs. In fact, the substitution 
of fossil fuel based energy by renewable energy would 
result in an emissions reduction, inherently improve air 
quality and reduce associated social costs. The results 
suggest that an estimated total of around 2.85 MT of

CO2 emissions and their associated monetary and social 
costs may be avoided by implementing the suggested 
REmap options as detailed in Figure 41. No important 
savings were proposed in the REmap case for the 
industrial sector, despite its importance, due to the lack 
of data.

0.3Associated costs and investments
The investments needed for the REmap case are 
identified with a focus on the power sector, which is 
the main ‘game-changer’. The cost of each incremental 
MW of installed renewable capacity in the REmap case 
beyond the reference case was determined based on 
a high, medium and low CAPEX for each technology. 
The total investment needed to implement the REmap 
options in the power sector in comparison to the base 
year amounts to USD 6.67 billion for the medium case, 
as shown in Table 13.
The investment needed to implement the REmap 
options in comparison to the reference case – in other 
words the investment needed only for the additional 
amount of renewables – is estimated at around 
USD 2.2 billion, as shown in Table 13. This investment 
would be mainly financed through the private sector and 
international financing institutions through an IPP/PPP 
model. Again, these costs do not include the upgrades 
to infrastructure required to successfully implement the 
REmap options, which would demand a more in-depth 
analysis of capacity expansion with higher shares of 
renewables and grid stability. The results in Table 13 and 
Table 14 below are rounded to the nearest integer.
Additional costs were identified for the REmap options 
proposed for the end-use sectors. These expenses would 
mainly include subsidising the price of heat pumps to 
make them price competitive in the Lebanese market; 
providing additional incentives for the deployment 
of solar water heaters; and potentially reducing the 
import and/or registration taxes on electric vehicles, 
ideally financed through international grants for 
subsidised loans. Accordingly, the government would 
not incur any major investment costs to implement the 
Remap options in end-use sectors and would benefit 
simultaneously from the monetary equivalent of the 
potential energy substitution.

Investments in the
power sector could 
be a game-changer 
in Lebanon’s shift
to renewablesAdditional renewable energy benefits and drivers 
The advantages of the Remap options are not only 
limited to the reduction of costs and emissions but also 
offer broader socio-economic and global benefits, such 
as the creation of new jobs and markets, the injection 
of cash inflows to the country, improved energy 
security through energy mix diversification, mitigation 
of oil bills, the promotion of domestic industries, and 
improved air quality.
However, to design effective policies in support of 
value creation, policy makers require a thorough 
understanding of materials and labour requirements. 
IRENA’s “Leveraging local capacity” report series 
examines these requirements in the solar PV and 
onshore wind industries (IRENA, 2017d; 2017b).
Figure 42 shows the main materials required by solar 
PV and onshore wind plants, and therefore indicates the 
kinds of industries most relevant to satisfy the inputs 
for renewable energy deployment. Maximising value 
creation from the development of a domestic solar PV 
industry, for example, requires leveraging capacities 
in industries such as glass, aluminium, silicon and 
semiconductors. Leveraging this capacity can provide 
expertise, raw materials and intermediary products for 
manufacturing PV components such as PV cells and 
modules, inverters, trackers, mounting structures and 
electrical equipment.
For a typical 50 megawatt (MW) onshore wind facility, 
almost 23 000 tonnes of concrete is needed for the 
foundations, and nearly 6 000 tonnes of steel and iron 
for the turbines and their foundations. For offshore 
wind the requirements are similar. Manufacturing 
the main components of a wind turbine requires 
specialised equipment as well as welding, lifting and 
painting machines that are used in other industries, 
such as construction. The foundations also require the 
use of specialised equipment including rolling, drilling 
and welding machinery. Special vessels and cranes 
are used to move these structures. Examining these 
requirements provides insights on industrial capabilities 
to be leveraged.

generates valuable information for policy makers on the 
occupational and skill structure along the value chain. 
Figure 43 shows the labour requirement for solar PV 
plants and onshore wind farms. 
For the development of a typical 50 MW solar PV project, 
a total of around 230 000 person-days is required from 
project planning to manufacturing, installing, operation 
and maintenance (O&M) as well as decommissioning. 
The highest labour requirements are in O&M (56%), 
followed by procurement and manufacturing (22%) and 
construction and installation (17%). In the procurement 
and manufacturing segment, factory workers and 
technicians represent 64% of the labour, followed by 
engineers (12%). In the O&M segment, construction 
workers account for 48% of the labour requirements, 
followed by safety experts (19%) and engineers (15%).
Similarly, for the development of a 50 MW onshore 
wind project, a total of 144 000 person-days is needed. 
The labour requirements are highest in O&M (43% of 
the total), followed by construction and installation 
(30%) and manufacturing (17%).

Based on IRENA analysisThe technological advancements in the areas of P2P 
trading and blockchain promote the implementation 
of community-scale renewable energy systems 
which, in turn, can boost the number of small-scale 
decentralised solar PV systems in Lebanon. In fact, the 
market for this type of application is already opening 
up in Lebanon with the recent implementation of 
community-based net metering pilot projects which 
rely on hybrid solar PV systems.
P2P energy trading managed by the utility offers an 
important potential for demand side management 
and control, specifically when these PV systems are 
coupled with battery storage where the energy flows 
can be potentially directed as needed. If replicated 
on a large-scale, potential grid support functions can 
be also explored.
These technologies also offer the potential to analyse 
the recorded consumption patterns of the prosumers, 
and hence optimise the energy forecasts for both 
renewable energy generation and load duration 
curves. The utility or TSO could ideally operate the 
blockchain and hence track all the transactions made 
in all the connected devices and households, which 
would facilitate grid monitoring and operation. 
In fact, many European TSOs are currently exploring 
the use of blockchain technology for energy demand 
response, measurement and verification, as well as for 
financial settlement. TSOs are also using blockchain 
in a pilot project to procure balancing services from 
behind-the-meter batteries. Locally, additional 
efforts are still needed to set the regulations and the 
business model for these promising technologies, 
which can play an enormous role in promoting smallscale decentralised renewable energy systems.
Road transport for passengers in Lebanon has been a 
major daily issue for the past five years. The growing 
population and the influx of refugees, often having 
a personal car, has worsened both the congestion 
and the emissions problem in the country due to the 
lack of developed and organised public transport. 
Consequently, passenger cars are expected to 
remain one of the main means of everyday transport 
in Lebanon in the medium term. 
Accordingly, and since the daily travelled distances 
are relatively short, the REmap analysis identified a 
potential role for electric mobility in Lebanon which 
could not only mitigate the emissions problem 
but also offer support to the grid. Admittedly, the 
introduction of electric mobility would eventually 
increase the demand for electricity, which is already 
a challenge in the local context. However, MEW plans 
for smart grids and smart charging technology, timeof-use pricing, fast technological advancements 
in the field and a solid regulatory framework could 
turn this challenge into a benefit and allow a 
higher potential for the introduction of additional 
renewables to the grid and the provision of both grid 
services and flexibility. 
Potential grid service provisions via decentralised 
battery storage
Dynamic charging and time-of-use tariffs would 
allow advanced forms of multidirectional smart 
charging, including vehicle-to-grid and vehicle-tobuilding that would, in turn, provide more flexibility 
to the grid. This multidirectional advanced charging 
feature would permit a reshaping of the load duration 
curve through either filling and/or peak shifting or 
shaving. This feature would help the grid operator 
to manage congestion and reduce the reliance on 
expensive peak units. Several similar pilot projects 
have already been successfully tested by renowned 
grid integration experts around the world. Advanced 
smart charging could also mitigate the peak created 
by EVs under uncontrolled charging by adopting 
an over-night slow charging pattern. Many types of 
smart charging have been developed; however, more 
in-depth analysis would be needed to determine the 
most suitable option for the Lebanese context. 
A major issue that should be considered would be 
the possible long waiting time for charging at the 
end-user level, which can be potentially mitigated 
via rooftop solar PV with adapted storage systems. 
This would create significant potential to integrate 
rooftop solar PV on existing filling stations and 
buildings in general, which can be retrofitted with 
a packaged solution to provide a charging service 
for EVs. 
The deployment of EVs can also reduce the 
curtailment risk of variable renewable generation 
in the short-term by using the battery as a storage 
facility to compensate for the intermittency of 
renewables.
Therefore, adapting the charging cycle for EVs to 
the prevalent conditions of the power system and 
to the needs of the vehicle user would facilitate 
their integration, allow additional integration of 
renewables and reduce emissions.

Box 2 P2P blockchain-based trading5. CHALLENGES AND 
 RECOMMENDATIONS 
The main challenges facing the deployment of renewable energy in 
Lebanon are related to the country’s institutional and regulatory framework, 
the availability of financing, and the state of resources, technology and 
infrastructure. This chapter discusses those challenges and proposes 
recommendations identified through the RRA process and REmap analysis.
INSTITUTIONAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
This report identifies the lack of a stable regulatory framework for renewable 
energy deployment and incomplete implementation of Law 462. Addressing 
this barrier would enhance the deployment of renewable energy resources 
for both large- and small-scale applications. Moreover, it would also help to 
attract more investments into the sector and create socio-economic benefits, 
including job creation.
Challenge A: Lack of a stable regulatory framework 
for renewable energy deployment and incomplete 
implementation of Law 462
Despite Lebanon’s Copenhagen obligations, the Lebanese government 
has not provided any incentives for renewable energy on the legal level or 
distinguished between renewable and conventional energy sources, whereby 
they remain constrained by law 462/2002 and its amendments. The legal 
framework does not clearly lay out the role of renewables in the energy mix; 
the institutional set up does not define the roles and responsibilities of the 
different institutions (government, city and municipal); and the regulations 
do not explicitly stipulate the involvement of the private sector. Moreover, 
the sector faces potential conflicts with laws and regulations from other main 
sectors (e.g., real estate, agriculture and tourism). Since 2002, the renewable 
energy sector has been developing based on temporary amendments and 
loopholes in existing laws and regulations.
Recommendations:
• Consider a new electricity law clarifying the role of renewable energy
To address the existence of several laws governing renewable energy 
deployment, a more integrated and stable solution would be to establish 
a holistic electricity law encompassing renewable energy applications, thus 
ensuring a consistent legal framework for the renewable energy sector.
• Establish an independent electricity regulatory authority
As provided by law 462/2002, the Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA) 
may allow for a clear and single access point for the private sector towards 
the electricity sector. 
The existence of the ERA would pave the way for setting streamlined procedures 
for the licensing of new renewable energy projects. The government, formed 
in January 2019, pledged to solve this problem by establishing the ERA and by 
prolonging law 288/2014 for the intermediate period to allow for the continued 
development of the sector. In addition, establishing the ERA and defining the 
different licensing procedures may help define the roles and scope of the Challenge B: Lack of sectoral and 
technology-specific renewable energy 
targets
In 2009, Lebanon set ambitious targets to meet 12% 
of its national primary energy mix with renewables by 
2020 through defined targets of different renewable 
energy installations. In 2018, these targets were revised 
to 30% of renewables in the energy consumption mix. 
However, there is no clarity on the long-term vision 
of the energy transition, including the role of energy 
efficiency and conservation and the synergies with 
renewable energy. In this context, the targets are not 
clearly distributed among end-uses, consuming sectors 
or technologies.
Recommendations:
• Ensure sectoral renewable energy targets are 
included in the energy mix
The new target of 30% needs to be complemented with 
specific targets for different renewable technologies 
and different consumption sectors for 2030. Thus, 
reinforcing the government’s commitment to the scaleup of renewable energy technologies and proposing 
a targeted action plan. In this regard, the energy mix 
proposed in REmap 2030 (Chapter 4) could be used to 
set a long-term vision towards the future energy mix, 
along with the sectoral objectives that combine energy 
efficiency and renewable energy deployments.
Box 4 outlines some of the guidelines provided in 
IRENA’s report, Renewable energy target setting.
Making targets mandatory; establishing targets in law 
is an important step in increasing their credibility and 
longevity.
Renewable energy targets exist at the intersection of 
multiple policy drivers and priorities including energy 
security, environmental sustainability and socioeconomic benefits.
While renewable electricity targets are most 
widespread, heating/cooling and transport sector 
targets are crucial for the energy transition.
Targets send an important signal to stakeholders and 
investors.
Stakeholder engagement strengthens ownership and 
target feasibility.
Technology-specific targets can be used to support 
the diversification of the energy mix to increase energy 
security along with sustaining the development of the 
local value chain of selected technologies. 
Targets established in absolute terms (a specific 
quantity of energy to be supplied) may be easier 
to set and monitor but targets that are relative to a 
moving baseline (i.e., in percentage terms) could be 
more effective.
Those responsible for meeting targets, as well as the 
means they employ to this end, require consideration.
Striking the right balance between ambition and 
realism is vital to the success of targets.
Effective renewable energy targets should be backed 
by clear strategies and specific policies.

Box 4 Guidance on renewable energy 
 target setting Challenge C: High subsidies and low tariffs
Electricity in Lebanon is highly subsidised. Therefore, 
the potential for future investments within the sector 
remains limited, resulting in high technical and nontechnical losses (34%, combined) and an old fleet of 
power plants. With that said, low electricity tariffs 
discourage investment in small-scale renewable energy 
applications, especially within net-metering schemes.
Recommendation:
• Reform subsides and tariffs
While renewable energy is gaining momentum on a global 
scale, to further build public and private investments on 
the national level, increasing tariffs may encourage both 
public and private investments in renewable energy 
projects, thus substituting expensive and aged thermal 
generation. Furthermore, higher tariffs would allow for the 
proliferation of renewables through small- and mediumscale deployment.
Challenge D: Limitations of enabling 
schemes for small-scale RE applications
The current net metering scheme was applied following 
a decision of the board of directors of EDL. It allowed 
for consumers to reinject excess renewable energy into 
the national electricity grid. However, the customers 
cannot reinject more than the equivalent of their 
total annual consumption, which limits the extent of 
application of renewable energy to other sectors such 
as the commercial and industrial sectors.
Moreover, complex administrative procedures coupled 
with a lack of awareness between the local authorities 
and the security services are causing bottlenecks in 
project implementation at the local level. 
Finally, the existing net-metering scheme does not allow 
for off-site installation or power wheeling and peer-topeer energy exchange, which limits the possibility of 
the wider deployment of small-scale applications.
Recommendations:
• Adopt legislation to promote distributed 
renewable electricity:
The deployment of virtual net-metering may be 
considered, by allowing consumers to buy shares in 
renewable energy projects and having the income 
deducted from their electricity bills.
Specific schemes could be developed paving the way 
for peer-to-peer contracts through direct PPA, allowing 
the developer to sell electricity directly to specific 
Challenge E: Coupling heating and cooling 
technologies in a national scheme
To date, efforts to deploy renewables in the heating and 
cooling sector have been represented by the application 
of solar water heaters. Although the adopted incentive 
schemes have been successful, SWH installations have 
slowed in recent years due to the removal of incentive 
mechanisms previously adopted in Lebanon.
Recently, the adoption of heat pumps has increased, 
given their high level of energy efficiency and their 
ability to serve the dual purpose of heating water while 
cooling space. However, there is a lack of data and 
support programs to deploy the full potential of this 
technology. 
Recommendation:
• Reinstate incentives for the installation 
of heating and cooling
The benefits of renewable energy are not solely in 
the power sector but also in the heating and cooling 
sector, therefore increasing the level of solar ordinance 
while inducing the mandatory use of SWHs (with the 
possibility of installing heat pumps in parallel) on all 
rooftops of new buildings could be considered.
As elaborated in the REmap section, subsidising heat 
pumps to increase competitiveness and reducing 
the import and/or registration taxes on electric 
boilers through financing with international grants 
will complement SWH incentives, resulting in cost 
reductions. Incentives for the deployment of superefficient heat pumps may be considered, keeping 
in mind the synergies with the power sector and the 
dependence of heat pumps on the availability of power.
The country is advised, therefore, to establish a data 
bank for heat pump market potential and create 
support programs to incentivise investments.RESOURCES, TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE
Despite ample renewable energy resources – 
particularly solar and wind – several challenges to the 
deployment of renewables exist in the grid system, at 
both the transmission and distribution levels. IRENA has 
found that addressing grid service concerns is possible 
by conducting grid impact assessments, reinforcing 
transmission infrastructure and introducing certification 
schemes. 
Challenge A: Concerns over grid stability 
and capacity constraints
In 2017, the UNDP CEDRO project developed a wind 
grid interconnection guide for Lebanon (CEDRO, 
2017), in which frequency readings of the Lebanese 
grid were published. These readings showed very high 
instabilities not only on the lower end where it reached 
48 Hz but also on the higher end of the spectrum where 
it reached close to 52 Hz.
When dealing with large-scale projects, instability 
becomes a problem, particularly on the technical side 
where it causes major issues for renewable energy 
plants when attempting to synchronise with the national 
grid. The frequency variations are the key parameters 
to shed loads based on a pre-assigned priority grid 
where the dispatching centre begins to shed loads from 
the lowest priority and up until the frequency stabilises. 
As Figure 13 shows, the transmission network shows 
weak zones where it is not sufficiently developed 
to handle power and frequency fluctuations from 
renewable energy generation, especially in the southeast or heavily congested areas like Mount Lebanon. 
This situation constrains the connection of large-scale 
renewable energy projects. 
Moreover, regional instability has deprived the Lebanese 
grid of interconnection to the regional network, thus 
forcing additional measures to maintain stability. 
Based on the wind atlas for Lebanon (GH, 2011) or 
solar irradiation measurements, the highest potential 
for wind generation is concentrated in the Akkar and 
Bekaa-Hermel regions, which are endowed with a 
significantly high solar irradiation estimated at 20% 
above other regions. These regions suffer from an 
underdeveloped transmission grid, especially on the 
medium voltage level where most of the substations 
are saturated or the network is not developed. This is 
essentially due to lower population density and weak 
economic development. However, a new overhead 
transmission line of 66kV is under construction with an 
expected service date in 2020, pertaining to a capacity 
of 145 MW. 
Transmission investment needs were addressed in the 
2013 master plan that was completely executed, and 
updated with amendments in 2017 and approved by the 
then government, where the major project focus was 
on developing both the north and south loops of Beirut, 
coupled with several investments in the transmission 
infrastructure of other regions in the country. 
The size of PV farms allows for the advantage of direct 
connection to the distribution sector without going 
through the transmission network, hence saving on 
transmission losses and acting as a back-up load 
replacing bulky generators. That said, the extension 
of the low-voltage network to include future mediumscale PV farms being evaluated currently within 
the scope of the 180 MW of PV farms may lead to a 
reduction in losses.
Recommendations:
• Conduct a complete grid impact assessment
Global best practices find that grid impact assessments 
on the national level may assist in overcoming the 
technical limitations to the integration of renewable 
energy in the grid and reinforce long-term planning to 
match the expected high levels of renewable energy 
penetration in 2030, including grid reinforcement. 
Moreover, dynamic stability studies are needed to 
overcome grid challenges as highlighted in the REmap 
section, in addition to the outcomes of IRENA’s 2017 
report, Planning for the renewable future: Long-term 
modelling and tools to expand variable renewable 
power in emerging economies. 
Specialised system studies may be conducted
(IRENA, 2017c), including:
• An assessment of the renewable energy carrying 
capacity of the Lebanese transmission and distribution 
grid under different geographical zones of interest. 
Such a study would also present the current picture 
of the grid’s inertial strength and flexibility limits, and 
identify areas of reinforcement in terms of advancing 
grid code, ancillary service regime and grid expansion 
priorities.
• A long-term generation adequacy study, appropriately 
modelling committed renewable energy resources (an 
important aspect often ignored in status quo planning 
processes). The analysis could be performed for 2025 
and 2030. Such an analysis would also inform policy 
making to better incentivise future energy sector 
investments. The aforementioned assessment would help EDL in 
the realistic review of the ability of renewables to meet 
the country’s power demand. This would also augment 
the planning processes at EDL whereby, in addition 
to transmission and generation planning, EDL can 
specifically plan for the flexibility and stability aspects 
of the grid.
Moreover, power and frequency fluctuations can be 
addressed by adding renewable energy plus storage 
systems, as well as pumped hydro systems, which will 
help harmonise the power output (Roy, 2019). This 
was one of the main reasons behind the expression of 
interest for PV with storage that was launched by the 
MEW and the LCEC. IRENA finds that the introduction 
of battery storage technologies can lead to multiple 
benefits, including enhancing grid stability, addressing 
curtailment concerns, along with the factors described 
in Box 2 of the REmap section.
As for hydropower concessions, the country could 
re-evaluate existing agreements with the Litani River 
Authority and new IPPs to include reserve capacity for 
frequency control and ancillary services. 
• Reinforce the transmission grid
As highlighted in the REmap section, implementation 
of the existing master plan is highly recommended 
to ensure the full deployment and expansion of the 
electricity grid in the various parts of Lebanon.
It may result in an increase in interconnection capacity 
with neighbouring countries to include easy energy flow, 
successful synchronisation, and increased capacity that 
will allow higher levels of penetration of renewables 
and guarantee grid stability.
• Deploy smart meters
As a first step for the full deployment of smart grids, 
smart meters could be deployed at the distribution 
level to ease the connections of distributed RE projects. 
Advanced smart charging, as described in Box 2 in 
the REmap section, would allow for a more successful 
integration of EVs by mitigating the peak created by 
EVs under uncontrolled charging.
• Strengthening human resources through 
capacity building
The socio-economic dimension of renewable energy 
is critically important for emerging economies looking 
to maximise the benefits from the transition in terms 
of job creation and local value creation. Since the first 
of renewable energy projects in Lebanon, EDL has 
assigned a dedicated taskforce to oversee renewable 
energy power generation
Available human resources must be fully utilised and 
current industrial policies leveraged for development 
and training, aiming to continue building up the 
necessary skills sets.
Challenge B: Quality standards for off-grid 
applications
A lack of certification and standardisation of distributed 
and off-grid solar systems in the local Lebanese market. 
Recommendation:
• Complete the set of standards
IRENA finds that minimum-quality-specific technical 
requirements for different applications (household 
PV/industries/solar pumping/solar street lighting/
community-led solar systems/micro grid systems) lead 
to ample benefits. Lebanon could integrate capacity 
building and skills training for different technologies, 
including solar and wind, and ideally adopt a national 
certification scheme for the design and installation of 
renewable energies.FINANCING AND THE ROLE OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR
Several financing incentives have been deployed to 
encourage renewable energy investments. Despite the 
strong presence of international finance institutions 
and favourable loan schemes such as the NEEREA, 
the Lebanon Energy Efficiency and Renewable 
Energy Finance Facility (LEEREFF) and the Green 
Economy Financing Facility (GEFF) burdensome 
administrative procedures exist that need to be 
addressed for both large-scale and small-scale 
applications in order to achieve a successful allocation 
of risks.
Challenge A: Limited access to risk 
coverage instruments
EDL’s creditworthiness constitutes a major challenge 
due to low electricity tariffs and high subsidies reflecting 
strong off-taker risk. To help in addressing this risk, the 
first PPAs positioned the MEW as the main signatory, 
while EDL was the accessor through a letter of credit 
signed by the central bank of Lebanon. 
Limited access to guarantees by the MoF or private 
guarantors restricts developers’ access to viable 
financing. Considerable land area in the regions of 
Akkar, Hermel and Bekaa – with the highest solar and 
wind potential – do not have clear ownership licenses, 
creating a major challenge to the development of largescale projects in these regions, as project developers 
are responsible for land acquisition. 
Recommendation:
• Consider measures to facilitate development 
and access to financing and risk mitigation 
schemes
The government may consider options to improve 
the creditworthiness of EDL by considering specific 
measures at existing electricity tariff and subsidy levels. 
The replication of lessons learned by adopting 
standardised PPA solutions may allow for easier access 
to different guarantee schemes. In this context, IRENA’s 
recently launched Open Solar Contracts – which provide 
the necessary contractual templates required for the 
bidding process, including the PPAs for solar projects 
– offer a useful source of information for developing 
standardised contractual templates or improving 
existing ones (IRENA, 2018); see Box 5.
The government could also consider the introduction 
of guarantees to back up the PPAs. One option 
would be the establishment of a fund to guarantee 
renewable energy projects, possibly with the support 
of international financing institutions (IFIs). This can 
help mitigate risks beyond those to the off-taker, such 
as those related to obtaining licenses.
Given that risk mitigation instruments are not easy 
to identify or obtain. IRENA has launched an online 
service for developers, lenders and investors to 
identify providers of risk mitigation instruments 
(RMIs), including guarantees that developers can 
access through an online matchmaking service 
– Climate Investment Platform (CIP). Moreover, 
IFIs can gradually move away from providing
(concessionary) loans toward blended finance 
(public–private co-financing trades) and risk mitigation 
solutions to mobilise the local private sector rather than 
replace it. 
Renewables cut costs, 
reduce emissions and 
bring socio-economic 
benefitsChallenge B: Limited interest from local 
banks to fund small-scale distributed 
projects
Despite the increasing size of renewable energy projects 
in Lebanon, Lebanese commercial banks (LCBs) are 
losing interest in financing relatively small projects due 
to high transaction costs, limiting the widespread use 
of decentralised applications in the residential sector. 
Recommendations:
• Bundle renewable energy projects
LCBs could also consider bundling of smaller-size 
renewable energy projects to achieve the required 
scale, thus reducing transaction costs while bolstering 
financial institutions confidence in projects and 
decreasing risks. However, standardisation is needed as 
a pre-condition for the bundling of renewable energy 
projects. 
• Once projects are standardised and aggregated (e.g. 
in a green bond), they could potentially be attractive 
to non-bank investors as well, such as institutional 
investors (insurance companies, pension plans, 
sovereign wealth funds, etc.) which prefer large scale 
investments through investment vehicles such as funds 
and bonds. IFIs active in this region can also help create 
(and provide first capital) for such investment vehicles, 
to attract more financiers to the renewables sector.
The energy sector today has a legacy of 
predominantly large and technically complex 
power generation projects. Due to their highly 
intricate transaction structures, these projects 
required customised and complex legal and 
financial solutions, which have been inherited by 
renewables. This has resulted in high transaction 
costs and prolonged project development 
timelines, hindering further capacity growth, 
particularly in small to medium-scale renewable 
energy projects. Therefore, redesigning prevailing 
market practices in project development and 
finance emerges as a pressing need and reforming 
the overly complicated contractual framework 
needs to be a priority.
In response, IRENA and TWI have jointly launched 
an initiative to simplify and streamline the 
contractual framework for solar power to unlock 
greater investments globally. This initiative (Open 
Solar Contracts), which is supported by multiple 
top-tier law firms, provides a standardised 
contractual documentation solution that is 
freely and publicly available and designed to be 
universally applicable.
The initiative presents templates for six core 
contracts:
The work on the contracts was supported by the 
review of specific model clauses in order to deal 
with cross-cutting matters in a consistent way and 
to reduce complexity. These include:
The resulting package of contract templates offers 
a consistent legal documentation solution. The 
templates are intended to be used in conjunction 
with one another to ensure that the scope of work 
and risks are appropriately allocated.
The initiative aims to decrease transaction costs, 
shorten project development timelines and 
establish a balanced risk allocation between the 
public and private parties. The initiative also aims 
to facilitate due diligence processes by financiers 
and lay the groundwork for project aggregation 
and securitisation. These would eventually support 
the rapid and widespread scale-up of solar power 
at the level required.
The contracts are available for review at:
1. Governing law 4. Corruption and sanction
2. Dispute resolution 5. Force majeure
3. Grid connection principles
1. Implementation agreement 4. Installation agreement
2. PPA 5. O&M agreement
3. Supply agreement 6. Finance term sheet
Box 5 Open solar contractsChallenge C: Land acquisition limitations 
and complex administrative processes
Currently, all bids being launched by the MEW and the 
LCEC allocate responsibility for securing the land to 
project developers, inducing additional risks pertaining 
to grid interconnection and resource availability.
The documentation requirements for bids and EOIs are 
complex and time-consuming, and the list of required 
documentation is not clear. This does not help to 
attract domestic and foreign investors into the sector. 
Moreover, bidders do not have access to a template 
of the resulting PPA contract, thereby increasing the 
variables and perceived risk.
Recommendations:
• Consider conducting land-specific auctions
So far, developers have had to take over the responsibility 
for securing the land, introducing additional risks related 
to grid interconnection and resource assessment. Some 
studies have been conducted to identify suitable sites 
in terms of land ownership (mostly publicly owned), 
resource availability and proximity to the grid (such as 
A. Berjawi et al., 2017 and AUB, 2019 as highlighted in 
S.3.c ). Such plots could be considered in future rounds, 
as the allocation of costs and the risks associated with 
land to the government has the potential to significantly 
reduce the prices resulting from auctions.
Across the different auction design elements, policy 
makers may consider the inherent trade-offs between 
potentially the most cost-effective outcome and other 
objectives including: ensuring projects are delivered on 
time, integrating higher shares of variable renewable 
energy, and supporting a just and inclusive energy 
transition (IRENA, 2019b). For further information on 
auction design, please see Annex 1.
• Standardise requirements in the bidding 
process
IRENA suggests including standardised documentation 
requirements and a transparent portal outlining the 
details of auctions to encourage bidders.
Standardised environmental practices for all the 
different renewable energy technologies could be 
adopted by working with international development 
organisations to create a ‘bird migration protocol’ that 
would meet all requirements for obtaining loans by IFIs.
Challenge D: Inadequate governing 
framework for hydropower concessions
Since the concessions for large-scale hydropower 
installations were formed prior to the establishment 
of EDL, there are two main challenges: first, the 
administrative framework needs to be revisited; second, 
the tariffs are not attractive enough to incentivise 
efficient production – apart from the Litani River 
Authority, which was changed from USD 0.03 to 0.04 
per kWh in 2017 and remains relatively low. 
Recommendations:
• Develop a new administrative framework 
and re-evaluate the tariffs
The existing framework governing water concessions 
has been in place since the 1900s and ends in the 
period 2020–2025, therefore a new framework adapted 
to the current context, coupled with a re-evaluation of 
the agreements of existing hydropower concessions 
to include higher tariffs may motivate the concessions 
to invest in maintaining and upgrading existing 
hydropower stations. 
• Consider the broader benefits of sustainable 
hydro development
The construction of dams based on sustainable practices 
can provide value to Lebanon not only for electricity 
generation but also other uses such as contributions to 
irrigation as well as flood and draught control. During 
planning efforts, proper quantification of the value of 
hydro dams that account for these multiple uses of 
water contribute to the enabling of the development 
of hydropower with dams in Lebanon – as long as 
one ensures that all hydro projects are planned and 
developed according to the best social–environmental 
practices.IRENA’s 2015 report Renewable energy auctions: A 
guide to design presented a framework for analysing 
auctions. The framework classified design elements into 
four main categories: auction demand; qualification 
requirements; winner selection; and sellers’ liabilities 
(IRENA, 2015). The framework was updated in IRENA’s 
latest report, Renewable energy auctions: Status and 
trends beyond price, reflecting developments and 
lessons learned in the dynamic renewable energy sector 
in the intervening years. This is presented in Figure 44.
Decisions made in the ‘auction demand’ category 
determine what is to be procured, and under what 
conditions. Crucial demand-side considerations include: 
1) the product to be auctioned (energy, capacity, green 
certificates, transmission lines, financial transmission 
rights, ancillary services or a mix); 2) whether and 
how the total demand is to be split among different 
products (technologies, zones or other breakdowns); 
3) the volume of the product to be auctioned and the 
lower and upper limits on the project size; 4) whether 
a pre-set auction schedule will be adopted and, if so, 
the schedule of committed future auctions; and 5) 
responsibility for demand-side commitments, which 
includes evaluating the factors that assure project 
developers of the off-taker’s creditworthiness.
In defining the auction’s demand, the ambition for 
a greater role of renewables in the energy mix must 
be weighed against cost-effectiveness. When the 
objective is to develop a particular technology, a 
technology-specific auction can be selected. If the 
goal is minimising costs, a technology-neutral auction 
can be introduced, allowing competition between 
technologies (e.g. in Brazil). When the objective is to 
meet urgent capacity needs while retaining flexibility in 
holding auctions, the total volume can be auctioned at 
once, through a standalone auction. If the objective is 
to further enhance investors’ confidence in a more costeffective outcome, the total volume auctioned can be 
divided into different rounds in a systematic auctioning 
scheme.
The category of ‘qualification requirements and 
documentation’ determines which suppliers will be 
eligible to participate in an auction and includes 
both the conditions participants must meet and the 
documentation they must provide prior to the bidding 
stage. Such requirements commonly relate to: 1) 
documentation to confirm that the firm has the capacity 
to develop the project; 2) site-specific documentation; 
3) technical requirements for the project; and 4) 
instruments to promote socio-economic development.

Figure 44: IRENA’s updated auction design framework
Source: IRENA, 2019bQualification requirements are key determinants of 
the competition in the auction and the prices offered 
by developers. If requirements in terms of permitting 
and documentation processes are too demanding, 
the transaction costs incurred by developers can be 
reflected in higher prices. Transaction costs can be 
reduced through site- or project-specific auctions 
where the government (or another entity) takes 
on the responsibility of site selection, resource and 
impact assessments, grid connection and obtaining 
necessary permits (e.g. in Denmark, Germany and the 
Netherlands). Moreover, while the requirement for an 
extensive track record in the field can help ensure timely 
project completion, it may also limit the participation 
to traditional, large players in the sector, which in turn 
affects the overall development of the sector.
Qualification requirements can also be designed to 
meet broader development goals related to domestic 
industry development and job creation (e.g. in South 
Africa and China).
In the ‘winner selection and contract award’ process, 
bidding and clearing rules are applied and contracts are 
awarded to the winner(s). The subcategories include: 
1) the formal bidding procedures, which set forth 
how supply-side information is collected; 2) minimum 
competition requirements, including provisions to 
ensure participation by multiple, competing bidders; 
3) winner selection criteria, dictating how bids will 
be ranked and winners selected; 4) the clearing 
mechanism, which defines rules for allocating contracts 
based on accepted bids; and 5) payment to the winner.
The winner selection process is at the heart of the 
auction. The criteria for selection, ceiling prices and limits 
on project size can significantly impact price outcomes, 
with the possibility of facing the following trade-offs. 
While a simple winner selection process based solely 
on the price can improve cost competitiveness, other 
objectives can be achieved by incorporating nonmonetary criteria, such as socio-economic benefits 
and project location (e.g. in Mexico). In addition, when 
the main objective is to ensure cost effectiveness, a 
low ceiling price can be set, above which bids are not 
considered; however, there is a risk that a sub-optimal 
amount of renewable energy will be contracted as a 
result, as such a low ceiling price lead to the rejection of 
some reasonable bids. 
A limit on the project size or on the volume that can be 
won by one bidder also impacts the price. Such measures 
were put in place in Zambia to diversify the portfolio 
of generators and reduce risks in case projects do not 
materialise. Auctions that have no limit on project size 
can benefit from economies of scale, as in the case of 
Dubai and Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, where 
800 and 1 170 MW of solar was contracted, respectively, 
at record-breaking prices in 2014 and 2016 respectively.
Procedures in the category of ‘risk allocation and 
remuneration of sellers’ define how risks (financial, 
production and others) are allocated among stakeholders 
(bidders, auctioneers, off-takers, financial institutions, 
consumers, etc.). These risks, responsibilities and 
obligations should be spelled out in auction documents. 
This critical design element involves: 1) commitment 
bonds (typically a bid bond and a construction bond) and 
a schedule for contract signature and commencement 
of commercial operations; 2) production and financial 
risks (associated with inflation, currency fluctuations, 
market prices and production hazards); 3) quantitybased liabilities, including settlement rules and penalties 
for underperformance; and 4) penalties for delays and 
underbuilding.
In determining the sellers’ liabilities in the power 
purchase agreement, there are various ways to allocate 
financial, operational and production risks between the 
project developer, the auctioneer and the off-taker. 
Auction design features can limit the developers’ risks 
resulting in lower prices, but these risks would then 
be passed on to the off-taker. Currency, inflation and 
production risks can be reduced through auction design 
(e.g. in Chile). In addition, liabilities can be reduced to 
encourage participation and increase competition, but 
at the risk of facing project delays or underproduction. 
Investor liabilities involve commitment to contract 
signing and project completion as well as compliance 
rules and penalties. 
These are important measures to ensure that projects are 
developed on schedule to meet the capacity needs of the 
power sector. However, if these measures are too strict, 
competition in the auction will be reduced, leading to 
higher prices. There are innovative ways to address these 
trade-offs, as in the case of Germany, where bidders 
with building permits saw their bid bond and completion 
bond requirements reduced by almost half.The LCOE for renewables is mainly driven by the capital 
expenditure (CAPEX) that is initially taken based on 
current average local market prices. The CAPEX for 
renewables is then projected to 2030 by multiplying its 
current values for each technology by the respective 
percentage CAPEX variation between 2016 and 
2030, as per IRENA estimates. CAPEX for hydro is an 
exception and is taken as per the prices estimated in 
the corresponding MEW EOI. The OPEX is taken as 
a percentage of the CAPEX as per IRENA estimates 
for each technology. LCOEs are then computed for 
different discount rates: 7% to reflect good conditions, 
10% to reflect fair conditions, and 13% to reflect poor 
conditions.
The worst case is assumed to correspond to the most 
expensive LCOE for renewables – assumed to be the 
one expected today in the Lebanese market. The best 
case is assumed to correspond to the multiplication 
of the current expected LCOE in Lebanon by the 
percentage variation between the current LCOE, as per 
IRENA values, and the cheapest LCOE for renewables 
obtained using the 7% discount rate. The average case 
is the mid-value between the two extremes, while the 
overall results are summarised in Table 15.
The LCOE for natural gas is mainly driven by the OPEX. 
The first variable considered for computing the LCOE for 
conventional generation is the discount rate, taken as 
the same as for renewables, assuming market discount 
rates are similar for conventional and renewable energy 
projects. The second variable is the price of natural 
gas, taken as per IRENA estimates for 2030: USD 5.2/
MMBTU, USD 6.9/MMBTU, and USD 8.5/MMBTU to 
reflect cheap, moderate and expensive gas prices. The 
overall results are shown in Table 16; Table 17 shows 
the overall savings under worst-case (LCOE1, cost1), 
mid-case (LCOE2, cost2) and best-case (LCOE3, cost3) 
scenarios obtained for the different combinations of the 
LCOEs for renewable and conventional technologies.
The worst-case scenario corresponds to the cheapest 
LCOE for conventional and most expensive LCOE for 
renewables. The best-case scenario corresponds to the 
cheapest LCOE for renewables and most expensive LCOE 
for conventional, while the average case corresponds to 
the mid-values for LCOEs. The total savings correspond 
in each case to the difference between the overall cost 
of energy in the reference case and the overall cost of 
energy in the REmap case.

Utility N/A
•	 Electricity demand for 2030 
estimated starting from 2017 
value.
•	 3% growth in demand until 
2020, 8% drop in 2020, and

•	 Assuming full shift towards 
natural gas.
•	 Assuming that the 
renewables are given a 
priority for generation. 
•	 Assuming overall weighted 
efficiency of 39.18% for CCGT 
and OCGT plants assuming 
they are running on natural 
gas.
•	 Assuming 61% of installed 
conventional capacity is 
CCGT running on natural gas 
at an efficiency of 45%.
•	 Assuming 39% of installed 
conventional capacity is 
OCGT running on natural gas 
at an efficiency of 31%.
•	 The Installed capacities for CSP and hydro

corresponding studies in the reference 
case 2030. Only wind and solar PV were 
promoted to reach the 30% target of the

of the electricity generated in the power 
sector would be equivalent to 30% of the
