Results and resources framework for South Sudan (2023–2025)…………………………………… 8I. UNDP within the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation 
Framework (UNSDCF)
1. South Sudan has enjoyed relative stability since the Revitalized Agreement for the Resolution 
of Conflict in South Sudan (R-ARCSS) in September 2018, raising cautious optimism for durable 
peace and the return to sustainable development. The country is endowed with vast landmass, 70
per cent of which is arable (with just 4 per cent cultivated). It holds the third largest oil reserves in 
Sub-Saharan Africa with an estimated 3.5 billion barrels,
1
and draws 90 per cent of revenue from 
oil despite other resource endowments including gold, iron ore, and aluminum.
2
 In 2020 and 2021, 
the economy was projected to grow above 10 per cent, but the COVID-19 pandemic contracted 
growth to 4.2 per cent3and led to fiscal and balance of payment deficits, inflation, a high debt burden 
and large financing gaps.4 UNDP and other partners assisted the government in engaging the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF), resulting in two Rapid Credit Facilities of $226.5 million US 
dollars and special drawing right of $334 million US dollars. IMF support helped stabilize the 
foreign exchange market and introduce measures against incurring commercial debt (which 
accounts for 84.3 per cent of national debt). The rebound of global oil prices and improving public 
finance management (PFM) has contributed to post-COVID-19 recovery and cushioning the impact 
of the war in Ukraine.
2. Notwithstanding progress and optimism, interconnected shocks like persistent subnational
violence and climate-induced events (floods and droughts) have led to escalating humanitarian 
situations, mass displacement, and extreme fragility. The 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan
estimates 8.9 million people will need humanitarian assistance. South Sudan was ranked the fourth
most fragile country globally in 2021;
5 53rd out of 54 countries in the Mo Ibrahim Index on African 
Governance in 2020;
6 185 out of 190 on the 2021 ‘ease of doing business index’7
, and 185 out of 
189 countries on the Human Development Index (HDI) in 2019. Only 27 per cent of males and 15
per cent of females are literate.
8
3. South Sudan is in the nascent stages of building strong and inclusive institutions, but protracted 
humanitarian assistance inadvertently slows down institution building as it substitutes the state in 
basic service delivery. Public infrastructure is poor: 1 per cent of the 20,000 km of roads is paved; 
6.7 per cent of the population have access to electricity; 8 per cent have access to internet and 8.6
per cent have an account at a financial institution or with a mobile-money service provider.9 Fiscal 
policies are weakened by deteriorating fiscal discipline, giving way to high levels of corruption and 
slow progress on PFM reforms. Weak capacities to generate data undermines evidence-based policy 
making, planning and the tracking of progress on the Sustainable Development Goals and other 
commitments. 
4. Persistent violence at the subnational level results in a significant loss of lives, human rights 
abuses, prevalence of extrajudicial killings, conflict-related sexual violence, abductions, and
psychosocial trauma. Subnational violence has escalated because of weak rule of law, proliferation 
of illegal firearms, large restive youth population, political manipulations of ethnic diversity, cattle 
raiding, and disputes between farmers and herders as they fight over dwindling water resources.
5. Entrenched patriarchal culture limits women and girls’ equal participation in all spheres of life. 
Most women (63 per cent) work in the agriculture sector compared to 13 per cent in the formal

10 Although women provide 80 per cent of agricultural labor, traditional systems limit 
women’s land ownership. 
6. Upwards of 95 per cent of the population depends on climate-sensitive sources for their 
livelihoods, which are depleting.
11 Between 1973 and 2005 the country lost 40 per cent of its forest
and annual deforestation is 2 per cent due to the unregulated use of timber and seasonal forest 
burning.
12 Climate-induced disasters occur with greater frequency and intensity, reversing 
development gains. The government pledged to address these challenges in its second Nationally 
Determined Contributions (NDC) and first National Adaptation Plan (NAP) in 2021.
7. Weak health systems, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, greatly impedes progress in 
the health sector. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis, and malaria are amongst the 
leading contributors to poverty and high mortality rates. Between 2010 and 2019, new HIV 
infections increased by 36 per cent, which was far from the 2010 global fast-track goal of a 75 per 
cent decline by 2020.
13
8. The Revised National Development Strategy (R-NDS 2021-2023) aligned to the R-ARCSS, 
aims to “consolidate peace, reduce humanitarian footprint, and stabilize the economy” by: a)
establishing and/or strengthening institutions for transparent, accountable, and inclusive 
governance; b) fostering macroeconomic stability and laying foundations for economic 
diversification; c) building critical infrastructure for sustainable development; d) supporting human 
capital development and protecting vulnerable populations to leave no one behind, and e)
empowering women and youth as drivers of growth and nation-building. The UNSDCF (2023-2025)
contributes to the R-NDS by prioritizing transparent, accountable, and inclusive governance;
sustainable economic growth and diversification; social development with protection of the most 
vulnerable; and women and youth empowerment for sustainable development.
9. This three-year country programme is derived from the UNSDCF. Based on comparative 
advantages, UNDP will co-lead Outcome 1, co-lead Outcome 2, and contribute to outcomes 3 and
4 of the UNSDCF. UNDP will perform its integrator role in UNSDCF implementation by a)
coordinating innovative solutions for generating and managing development data; b) tracking
development trends, foresight, and macroeconomic analysis; c) providing evidence-base studies for 
integrated humanitarian, development, and peace nexus programming, and d) focusing on 
innovation, digitalization, and technology as development accelerators. 
10. Contributions of UNDP (2018-2022) country programme to the UNSDCF (2018-2022) are 
articulated in the midterm evaluation and Independent Country Programme Evaluation (ICPE)
reports. The ICPE report notes that UNDP created a “niche in the recovery and stabilization response 
in South Sudan”; contributed to capacity building of government institutions; produced tangible 
results in skills and entrepreneurship development for youth; and has consistently ensured women’s 
inclusion across its projects. This country programme incorporates ICPE recommendations to
strengthen the cohesion of youth initiatives, harness renewable energy solutions for sustainable 
livelihoods, better position UNDP in coordinating peacebuilding and statebuilding efforts, and 
strengthen UNDP field presence. 
II. Programme priorities and partnerships 
11. The country programme aims to support the government and people of South Sudan to 
transition out of humanitarian assistance towards sustainable development with an emphasis on

12 UN Environment Programme (UNEP) 2018, “South Sudan: First State of Environment and Outlook Report 2018," Available at 
h/////hdfiidlk2018statebuilding and peacebuilding. The programme is organized in two pillars: (a) inclusive 
governance and sustainable peace (IGSP)—based on UNSDCF outcomes 1 and 4 and contributing
to UNDP Signature Solutions 1, 2 and 6, and (b) sustainable environment, economic empowerment, 
and resilience (SEER)—based on UNSDCF outcomes 2 and 3 and, contributing to UNDP Signature 
Solutions 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
12. The country programme has a two-prong focus of state building and nexus programming. It
adopts a bottom-up state building approach of laying foundations for cohesive community and social 
contracts, building and/ or strengthening local government and national institutions for service 
delivery, extending rule of law authority, and economic diversification and local economic 
development through small-scale technology and innovation that will increase climate-smart 
agricultural productivity, value addition, marketing, and financial inclusion. Building on the 
Partnerships for Recovery and Resilience, UNDP will work with humanitarian, development, and 
peace/security actors for integrated and complementary programming that builds resilience and 
sustains peace, to transition the country out of humanitarian situations.
13. The UNDP gender equality and women empowerment strategy will guide implementation of 
the country programme with allocations of at least 15 per cent of the budget to gender related 
initiatives, as well as supporting women-led local economic empowerment activities, and 
advocating for the implementation of 35 per cent affirmative action commitments in the R-ARCSS.
14. UNDP enjoys strong partnership with the government, development partners, and civil society 
organizations (CSOs) for resource mobilization and programme delivery. In the private sector, 
UNDP partners with Stanbic Bank and MTN on economic empowerment and aims to expand private 
sector engagement during this country programme cycle. UNDP co-leads with UN Mission in South 
Sudan (UNMISS) on all milestones for political transition. In the United Nations Country Team 
(UNCT), UNDP will continue to support joint programming and inter-agency collaboration with a 
focus on the Common Chapter in the Strategic Plans of UNDP, the United Nations Children’s Fund 
(UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and UN Women. 
15. The theory of change follows: IF capacities and commitment of government at all levels are 
enhanced; infrastructure, strategies, and policies are in place to improve basic service delivery, 
access to justice including expeditious redress of sexual and gender based violence (SGBV), reduce
subnational violence to foster social cohesion, and strengthen public finance management; and IF
the economy is diversified, young women and men have vocational and entrepreneurial skills to 
drive the economy with focus on agriculture value-chain, and regional trade through the Africa 
Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) is improved; and IF biodiversity is conserved, green energy 
solutions pursued, and systems for climate-induced disaster risk management are effective; IF
vulnerable communities access enhanced health and social protection services, and IF peaceful 
elections are held and women gain 35 per cent of electable seats, the voices of youth and vulnerable 
population strengthened and their rights protected; THEN peaceful political transition will be 
achieved, the economy will be more resilient to shocks, and South Sudan will return to its 
development trajectory of accelerating progress on the SDGs.
16. UNDP will rely on its pool of experts in country, the regional hubs, and central bureaus to 
support implementation, particularly in economic diversification, PFM, trade, innovation and 
digitalization, environment, energy solutions, and climate resilience. UNDP will leverage SouthSouth and triangular cooperation resources for sharing knowledge and experiences. UNDP will 
work with local authorities and communities, focusing on conflict-affected and remote 
communities, displaced and HIV/AIDS-affected populations, youth, people living with disabilities, 
and people associated with armed groups.
Pillar 1:Inclusive governance and sustainable peace 
17. UNDP will support the government, R-ARCSS guarantors, and CSOs to: (a) create enabling 
legal environment and promote citizens participation in the constitution-making process (CMP) and 
CiifTthRilitid Hli(CTRH)d (b) hthititd credibility of elections by strengthening the capacity of the Elections Commission, the Political 
Party Council, and CSOs, as well as the police and judiciary for elections security and dispute 
resolution in compliance with human rights standards. Support to elections will be in partnership 
with United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), UN Agencies and relevant international 
development partners. 
18. UNDP will scale up support to public service reforms in partnership with the Ministry of Public
Service and Human Resource Development, the Government of Norway, and the African 
Development Bank, through civil service training, digitalization of civil service payroll, and 
reforming civil service rules and procedures. It will also support (a) the Transitional National 
Legislative Assembly (TNLA) and post-transition assembly to perform oversight, law-making, and 
representation functions and the Parliamentary Service Commission for effective functioning of 
parliament; b) the annual Governor’s Forum to improve transparency and interactions between 
national and state governments; c) participation of women in peacebuilding and decision-making 
process, drawing inspiration from the R-ARCSS provision of a minimum of 35 per cent women’s 
representation, and d) the Local Government Board (LGB) and State Ministries of Local 
Government to strengthen the capacity of local governments at all levels for effective service 
delivery. 
19. UNDP will partner with the Government of the Netherlands, European Union, UNMISS, and 
UN Agencies drawing on the Peacebuilding Fund (PBF) to consolidate gains made on strengthening 
access to justice and rule of law. This includes (a) supporting the re-establishment and strengthening 
of justice institutions and customary mechanisms to efficiently and equitably deliver fair, accessible 
and gender responsive justice services; (b) strengthening and expanding legal institutions handling 
SGBV and conflict-related sexual violence cases; (c) expanding legal aid services for women, 
people living with disabilities, and displaced and other vulnerable groups in targeted communities;
(d) strengthening the national human rights commission and civil society organizations to monitor, 
promote and protect citizen's rights; (e) supporting the establishment of survivor centered, gendersensitive, and inclusive transitional justice mechanisms; (f) supporting government to build 
sustainable ‘people centered’ community security mechanisms in hotspot areas and borderlands; (g)
supporting corrections reforms and prison-based vocational training aimed at rehabilitating inmates
and enabling social reintegration, and (h) improving police–community relationships to help regain 
public trust by strengthening accountability mechanisms and civil oversight of the National Police 
Service. 
20. UNDP will partner with Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA), Korean 
International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), UN Mission in South Sudan, government Ministries, 
and community leaders to strengthen and expand work to sustain peace, reconcile communities, 
provide space for civic engagement, and address structural causes of conflicts through: (a) support 
to implement the South Sudan Peacebuilding Strategic Framework, (b ) promoting inter-community 
interactions through socioeconomic activities to foster social cohesion; (c) supporting the role of 
media (community radio) in promoting peace, healing and reconciliation; (d) expanding sports and 
arts for peace; (e) strengthening the capacity of state and local governments to monitor and prevent 
climate related conflicts and violence in borderlands; (f) supporting community sensitization and 
awareness on trauma and psychosocial support; (g) supporting community dialogues and mediation 
processes to address community and subnational conflicts and violence, and (h) providing technical 
support to relevant ministries to implement national action plans on women and youth peace and 
security as part of the national commitment to United Nations Security Council resolutions 1325 
and 2250. UNDP will support the Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration Commission 
and Bureau for Community Security and Small Arms Control to design sustainable communitybased reintegration programme for former combatants, including women associated with fighting 
groups. 
21. UNDP will a) support the development of an integrated financing strategy and gender budgeting; 
b) strengthen capacity of the Sectoral Planning Unit and help establish a Monitoring and Evaluation domestic revenue mobilization through taxation including the harmonization of the national, state 
and local taxation systems; d) relaunch the Aid Information Management System (AIMS) and aid 
coordination forums, and e) strengthen data collection, analysis, and reporting on resource flows, 
SDGs, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 
Pillar 2: Sustainable environment, economic empowerment, and Resilience (SEER) 
22. UNDP will expand youth empowerment and enterprise development activities in all 10 states 
and 3 Administrative Areas by (a) developing critical labour-market demand skills of young women 
and men; (b) expanding and operating integrated business, employment, and innovation hubs to 
provide financial and e-market literacy; c) supporting women led small and medium enterprises 
(SMEs) in agriculture value chain and access to local and regional markets; d) supporting the 
government to establish a National Youth Service to take to scale youth employment, foster 
volunteerism, and promote inter/intra ethnic interactions for nation-building.
23. UNDP will increase the number of facilities offering HIV/tuberculosis services from 80 to 100
to reduce new HIV infections by 50 per cent by 2025; reduce deaths amongst people living with HV 
by 50 per cent by 2025; and reduce tuberculosis incidence by 30 per cent (relative to 2019). UNDP 
will also support capacity strengthening of the Ministry of Health and state health line ministries to 
coordinate and lead health care service delivery in post-transition South Sudan. 
24. UNDP will support a) trade competitiveness and economic diversification by facilitating the 
creation of a conducive trade policy environment; b) improvement of access to regional markets,
taking advantage of opportunities under the AfCFTA; c) development of a national strategy for 
economic diversification focusing on sustainable and climate-smart agriculture and non-oil mining 
sectors; and d) strengthening of platforms for investment and ‘ease of doing business’.
25. UNDP, in partnership with the Ministries of Environment and Finance and Planning and other 
relevant stakeholders, will support the government to implement the NDC and NAP with a focus 
on: a) the government pledge to plant 100 million trees; b) promoting climate-smart and resilient 
agricultural technology and watershed development; c) providing thought leadership to the UN 
climate security task force; and d) promoting the use of and increase access to clean energy through 
the generation and distribution of affordable, green energy solutions for public institutions and 
communities. 
26. Together with partners UNDP will a) support the government to implement relevant components 
of the National Action Plan for Return, Recovery, and Reintegration (NAP-RRR) as well as the
South Sudan Durable Solutions Strategy; b) support the implementation of disaster risk management 
and climate adaptation including national capacities for early warning and early action; and c) scale 
up social protection and safety-net support for vulnerable populations through short-term 
employment opportunities linked to community productive infrastructure.
III. Programme and risk management
27. This country programme outlines UNDP contributions to national results and serves as the 
primary unit of accountability to the Executive Board. Accountability of managers at the country, 
regional and headquarter levels are prescribed in the organization’s Programme and Operations 
Policies and Procedures and Internal Control Framework. Compliant with Executive Board decision 
2013/9, all direct costs associated with project implementation will be charged to concerned 
projects. Structures and procedures will be reviewed to ensure they are fit for purpose and remain 
flexible to the fragile South Sudan context. The programme will be directly executed to enable 
response to force majeure and weak national capacities.
28. Interconnected risks include security, such as relapses into civil war and/ or subnational violence 
with disruptive impacts. Considering the former is less likely than the latter, UNDP will increase 
coordination and continuous monitoring and surveillance with UNDSS and UNMISS to implement 
outstanding R-ARCSS tasks and scale-up early warning and mediation systems in communitieson time requests with the Global Shared Services Center (GSSC). Financing risks are related to the 
contraction of the global economy resulting from COVID-19 and ongoing war in Ukraine, which 
will be mitigated by advocacy for increased government cost-sharing and joint programming to ‘do 
more with less’. Environmental risks are rooted in prolonged flooding, which will be prevented and 
mitigated through early warning systems and strengthening social and environmental impact 
assessment monitoring of mining (oil) companies.
14
IV. Monitoring and evaluation
29. The Results and Resources Framework, aligned with the UNDP Strategic Plan and UNSDCF, 
serves as the accountability framework, with programme outcome and output indicators. The 
country programme builds on a robust theory of change and individual problem trees for the two 
pillars to allow for results tracking. Indicators at outcome and output levels have been aligned with 
existing SDG and national indicators and data sources. In addition to annual and mid-year 
programme reviews, monitoring of project implementation will be based on progress reports from 
implementing partners at six-month intervals. UNDP will use various innovative strategies and tools 
to collect and provide information about results and to augment its communication and advocacy 
efforts. UNDP will continue to boost the technical and digital capacities of national statistics and 
planning institutions to address existing data gaps, weak disaggregation of development data, and 
over-reliance on proxy indicators.
30. UNDP will ensure the evaluation plan follows guidelines from the Independent Evaluation 
Office and that each evaluation is funded. At least 3 per cent of programme resources will be 
earmarked for monitoring, evaluation, and assessments. Evaluation of programme and projects will 
be executed as defined in the evaluation plan. The evaluation plan covers the four outcomes, meeting 
the corporate evaluation threshold. It will be reviewed and updated periodically. UNDP will 
participate in UNSDCF evaluations as required. The country office will continue to use UNDP 
Gender Marker to ensure programmes supporting gender equality and women empowerment are in 
line with corporate policies. It will also adhere to UNDP Enterprise Risk Management Policy, social 
and environmental standards, and the UN Disability Inclusion Strategy.Annex. Results and resources framework for South Sudan (2023-2025)
