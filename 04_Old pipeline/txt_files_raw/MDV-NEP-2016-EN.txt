CONTENTSMOST COMMON TYPE OF LIGHT USED IN THE PAST7
Our vision for the energy sector is provision of 
reliable and sustainable energy services for social 
and economic development for all the people of the 
Maldives at the lowest possible cost. This vision can 
be achieved with improved sector level planning 
and good decision making. For this, policies are an 
important tool. As the ministry is mandated with 
overlooking the energy sector and making policies 
for the energy sector, it is our responsibility to make 
policies harmonizing with the growing needs of the 
sector.
The policy statements of Maldives Energy Policy 
and Strategy 2016 are in line with the Government 
Manifesto and Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs), Goal 7, and the strategies will contribute to 
achieve Manifesto pledges and SDG Goal 7 targets. 
The key features of the government’s national energy 
policy include providing all citizens with access to 
affordable and reliable electricity services, increasing 
energy security, promoting energy efficiency and 
conservation, and moving toward the target of 
renewable energy based electricity supply.

INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE
The Ministry of Environment and Energy is 
responsible for policy, planning and development of 
the energy sector.
The regulatory body is a semi-autonomous authority 
affiliated to the Ministry of Environment and Energy 
and operates under guidance of a Governing Board 
appointed by the President. The regulator is mandated 
with establishing tariffs, issuing guidelines and 
regulations to ensure the reliability, security of the 
grids, and that the rights and obligations of consumers 
and service providers are safeguarded.
State Trading Organization is the main importer and 
supplier of petroleum products.
Electricity service is provided by 3 main state owned 
utilities namely State Electric Company Limited, 
FENAKA Corporation Limited and Male’ Water and 
Sewerage Company Private Limited. 
CURRENT STATUS
The Maldives relies almost entirely on imported fossil 
fuel to meet its energy demands. In 2015, 506, 334 
metric tons of fuel was imported, which includes; 
12,385 metric tons of cooking gas, 389,968 metric 
tons of diesel, 38,683 metric tons of petrol and 
65,299 metric tons of aviation gas. 
capital Male’ and the islands in its vicinity (collectively 
called as greater Male’ region) accounts for 
approximately 63% of the total electricity consumed 
in all inhabited islands in the country.
Due to the dispersed nature of the islands, Maldives 
does not have one single national grid. Each island 
has its own electricity generation and distribution 
facility resulting in costly electricity service. The cost 
to produce one unit of electricity is 14-50 cents at the 
current fuel price depending on the size and quality 
of the electricity system. The high production costs 
require government subsidies to the utilities.
However, all inhabited, commercial and tourist resort 
islands of Maldives have a 24-hour electricity service. 
Maldives achieved universal access of electricity in 
2008. Today, the country has a total installed capacity 
of 330MW of diesel generators to cater for the 
electricity demand. The annual electricity demand 
is projected to grow at a rate higher than 8.5% per 
year, with this growth rate being influenced most 
significantly by the increase in electricity demand for 
the greater Male’ region. 
Reducing the dependency on imported fossil fuel and 
at the same time meeting the ever increasing demand 
for electricity are the major challenges the country 
has. Although, harvesting electricity from locally 
available renewable energy sources is a sustainable 
solution, there is a long way ahead to achieve a fully 
transformed energy sector. Under the current policy 
ENERGY SECTOR OVERVIEW10
in all inhabited islands from renewable energy sources 
by 2018.
Maldives is undergoing transformation of the energy 
sector in order to minimize dependency on fossil 
fuel and to increase energy security. Policy measures 
undertaken so far include targeted electricity 
subsidies, import duty exemption for renewable 
energy products and introduction of net metering.
The Maldives relies almost entirely 
on imported fossil fuel to meet its 
energy demands. In 2015,506,334 
metric tons of fuel was imported, 
which includes; 12,385 metric tons 
cooking gas, 389,968 metric tons 
diesel, 38,683 metric tons petrol and 
65,299 metric tons aviation gas.11
One of the key objectives of the government’s 
energy policies is providing affordable and reliable 
electricity to the people. At the same time, reducing 
the economic, social and environmental implications 
of high fossil fuel dependence is a top priority. 
Moreover, increasing the national energy security is 
recognized as a key target. Thus, government aims to 
utilize indigenous renewable energy resources and to 
deploy renewable technology to the optimum levels.
For planning of the sector activities, the following policy 
documents have been in use.
1. The Energy Action Plan (2009-2013): includes 
a series of actions, measures, programmes and 
targets for a period of five years to achieve greater 
energy efficiency and conservation awareness, 
reductions in CO2 emissions
2. Energy Policy and Strategy 2010: includes policy 
statements and strategies for developing greater 
sustainability conservation and efficiency in energy 
whilst promoting low carbon technologies and the 
quality of energy supply
3. Maldives Scaling up Renewable Energy Investment 
Plan: identifies opportunities and presents a plan 
for scaling up of renewable energy in the country
4. Government Manifesto 2014-2018: mentions 
solutions under pledges for reducing spending on 
electricity bill and getting economic benefits from 
clean energy
The Maldives Energy Policy and Strategy 2010 consisted 
of 9 key policies, which are:
1. Provide all citizens with access to affordable and 
reliable supply of electricity
2. Achieve carbon neutrality in the energy sector by 
year 2020
3. Promote energy conservation and energy 
efficiency
4. Increase national energy security
5. Promote renewable energy technologies
6. Strengthen the management capacity of the 
energy sector
7. Adopt an appropriate pricing policy for the energy 
sector
8. Ensure customer protection
9. Enhance the quality of energy services
GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF MALDIVES ENERGY 
POLICY
1. Create an enabling environment for the growth of 
a reliable and sustainable energy sector and meet 
the constitutional obligation of Government in the 
provision of electricity to every inhabited island at 
reasonable standards commensurate to the island
2. Reduce overreliance of the energy sector and 
the national economy on fossil fuels through the 
diversification of energy supplies
3. Improve energy efficiency and energy conservation 
4. Encourage the adoption of low-carbon 
technologies in production, distribution and energy 
ENERGY POLICY BACKGROUND12
5. Exploit local energy resources and renewable 
technologies
6. Engage private sector participation in the 
development of the energy sector, energy services 
and quality assurance mechanisms
7. Ensure energy equity through social protection 
and mechanisms and/or safety nets for vulnerable 
groups of the population
ENERGY POLICY 2016 SUMMARY
Maldives Energy Policy and Strategy 2016 consist of 
revised policies derived from Maldives Energy Policy 
and Strategy 2010. The 9 policies are reduced to 5 
key policy statements, which are:
1. Strengthen the institutional and regulatory 
framework of the energy sector
2. Promote energy conservation and efficiency
3. Increase the share of renewable energy in the 
national energy mix 
4. Improve the reliability and sustainability of 
electricity service and maintain universal access to 
electricity
5. Increase national energy security
One of the key objectives of the 
government’s energy policies is 
providing reliable and sustainable 
electricity to the people. 13

MALDIVES 
ENERGY 
POLICY AND 
STRATEGY 28
 Energy is a core and 
fundamental part of a modern 
society. Having reliable and 
affordable access to energy 
is the major driving force for 
economic development. As we 
strive to improve and develop 
the energy sector of the 
Maldives, we are faced with 
many obstacles and challenges 
to overcome. One of the 
obstacles for proper planning 
of the sector is challenges in 
collecting and having access 
to reliable and accurate data. 
As quality data is imperative 
for sector planning and 
development, Ministry of 
Environment and Energy has 
been collecting electricity data 
of the inhabited islands since 
2013 with the aim to publish 
yearly energy outlook book.
