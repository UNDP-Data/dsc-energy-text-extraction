20-Year Energy Efficiency 
Development Plan
(2011 - 2030)Summary
of the 20-Year Energy Efficiency Development Plan
(2011-2030)
o This 20-year Energy Efficiency Development Plan (EEDP) is formulated with a target 
to reduce energy intensity by 25% in 2030, compared with that in 2005, or 
equivalent to reduction of final energy consumption by 20% in 2030, or about 30,000 
thousand tons of crude oil equivalent (ktoe).
o The economic sectors with priority for undertaking energy conservation are the 
transportation sector (13,400 ktoe in 2030) and the industrial sector (11,300 ktoe in 
2030).
o The EEDP is aimed at reducing energy elasticity (the percentage change in energy 
consumption to achieve 1% change in national GDP) from an average of 0.98 in the 
past 20 years to 0.7 in the next 20 years.
o Implementation in pursuance of the EEDP will result in cumulative energy savings at 
an average of 14,500 ktoe/year, which is worth 272 billion baht/year, and 
cumulative CO2 emission reductions at an average of 49 million tons/year.
o Both mandatory measures, via rules and regulations, and supportive/promotional 
measures will be introduced. Major mandatory measures include the enforcement 
of the Energy Conservation Promotion Act, B.E. 2535 (1992), as amended up to No. 
2, B.E. 2550 (2007), the establishment of Minimum Energy Performance Standards 
(MEPS), and energy efficiency labeling. As for supportive and promotional 
measures, a major one will be the Standard Offer Program (SOP), or funding for the 
amount of energy saving achieved, which can be proven or assessed.
o Emphasis will be placed on measures which will bring about market transformation 
and energy consumers’ behavioral change, by enforcing energy efficiency labeling 
for equipment/appliances, buildings and vehicles so as to provide options for 
consumers.
o Large-scale energy businesses, e.g. those in the electricity, oil and natural gas 
industry, will be required to implement energy conservation promotion measures to 
encourage their customers to reduce energy use by a specified minimum standard 
(Energy Efficiency Resource Standards: EERS), instead of allowing such measures to 
be voluntarily undertaken as previously practiced.
o Assistance measures, both financial and technical, will be provided for small
operators, e.g. SMEs, particularly the provision of funding via the Standard Offer 
Program (SOP) and technical assistance via the Energy Efficiency Resource Standards 
(EERS).
o As the use of motor vehicles is projected to continuously increase in the future, this 
EEDP includes measures promoting the use of highly energyefficient vehicleseg
EEDP Highlightso Responsibilities for energy conservation promotion will be distributed to all spheres 
in society. The private sector will become an important partner and greater roles 
will be entrusted to local administration organizations. In addition, government 
agencies must set a good example of energy conservation practices.
1. Background and Objectives
“Energy Conservation” in this Energy Efficiency Development Plan has two meanings: 
(1) economical use or reduced expendable use of energy, and (2) energy efficiency 
improvement, i.e. doing the same activities with less energy, involving, among others, 
lighting, hot water production, cooling systems, transportation or running machines in the 
manufacturing process. Energy conservation plays an important role in strengthening 
energy security, alleviating household expenditure, reducing production and services costs, 
reducing trade deficit and increasing the competitive edge, including reduction of pollution 
and greenhouse gases (GHG) which cause global warming and climate change. Therefore, 
energy conservation has been an important policy of the government, particularly since the 
enforcement of the Energy Conservation Promotion Act, B.E. 2535 (1992). Five-year plans 
to allocate funding support from the Energy Conservation Promotion Fund for energy 
conservation activities have been consecutively developed, now being in Phase 3. 
Nevertheless, the government has foreseen that problems with energy prices, international 
competition for energy resources, environmental impact and climate change resulting from 
energy production and utilization will be exacerbated in the future, which will inevitably 
affect people’s well-being and the national economic competitive edge. In addition, at the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in 2007, government leaders ratified the 
collaboration in energy conservation promotion to meet the agreed target in 2030. In 
response to this, the Ministry of Energy has developed this 20-year Energy Efficiency 
Development Plan (2011-2030) to provide the national policy framework and guidelines on 
energy conservation implementation in the long term, with the following two main 
objectives:
(1) To set the energy conservation targets in the short term (five years) and in the 
long term (20 years), both at the national level and by energy-intensive economic 
sectors, i.e. transportation, industry, commercial and residential sectors;
(2) To lay down strategies and guidelines promoting energy conservation to achieve 
the targets specified under (1) above, and to lay down measures and work plans to 
serve as the framework for concerned agencies in formulating their respective 
action plans for energy conservation promotion.
2. Energy Conservation Targets and Potential
In the past 20 years (1990-2010), energy consumption in Thailand continuously 
increased at an annual average rate of 4.4%. At present, energy consumption is 2.3 times 
the amount it was in 1990; the growth rate has been in line with the economic growth rate, 
of which the annual average rate is 4.5%. In particular, energy consumption growth rates in 
the manufacturing industry and commercial building sectors are much higher than the GDP 
growth rate, i.e. 3.0 and 3.7 times respectively, compared with consumption in 1990.In the next 20 years, if there is no energy conservation or energy efficiency 
improvement measures or no significant reform of the industrial structure and 
transportation system, energy demand under the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario will 
increase from 71,000 ktoe/year at present, to 151,000 ktoe, or about 2.1 times the present 
amount, accounting for an annual average growth rate of 3.9%, under the assumption that 
the GDP will grow at an annual average rate of 4.2%. The demand in the industrial and 
commercial sectors will still increase at a higher rate than other sectors. Hence, greenhouse 
gas emission from the energy sector will tend to increase accordingly.

According to the agreement reached by APEC Leaders in 2007 in Sydney, Australia, an 
energy conservation target has been set with a view to strengthening regional energy 
security and addressing climate change problems, by reducing “energy intensity,” or the 
amount of energy used per unit of GDP, by 25% in the year 2030 compared with the 2005 
base year. Since Thailand’s energy intensity in 2005 was 16.2 ktoe per billion baht GDP (at 
1988 constant value), if Thailand is determined to implement energy conservation measures 
pursuant to the mentioned agreement, the overall energy intensity of the country in 2030 
must not exceed 12.1 ktoe per billion baht GDP, or the final energy consumption in that
year must not exceed 121,000 ktoe (under the assumption that the annual economic 
growth rate will be at 4.2% in average). That is, energy demand must be 30,000 ktoe lower 
than that in the BAU case, or 20% lower than the demand in the BAU case.40,000

However, the outcome of potential assessment, in technical terms, reveals that the 
implementation of energy conservation measures, via demand side management and 
application of more advanced energy efficiency technology, in terms of
equipment/appliances, machinery and manufacturing process, vehicles and buildings, 
including the change in energy consumption behavior, will have energy-saving potential in 
the three major economic sectors of approximately 36,450 ktoe in 2030, which is 22% 
higher than the specified target. Therefore, the specified energy conservation target can be 
achievable, but vigorous measures in all economic sectors would be required because the 
gap between the target and the potential is not too wide to bridge. In this connection, it is 
forecasted that the share of energy saving by sector in 2030 will be as shown in Table 1, 
with the transportation and industrial sectors together holding the highest energy saving 
share, i.e. over 80% in terms of final energy, or 69% in terms of primary energy, because the 
commercial building sector will account for a huge volume of power consumption.

In case energy conservation measures can be successfully implemented until the 
target specified under this plan is achieved, energy consumption up to 2030 will increase at average energy elasticity at 0.71 over the next 20 years, compared with the average of 0.98 
over the past 20 years.

3. Strategies and Measures
In previous Energy Conservation Programs, both mandatory and supportive strategic 
approaches and measures were introduced, i.e. via rules/regulations and provision of 
financial incentives, technical assistance and knowledge, including various forms of public 
awareness campaigns to create energy conservation awareness of the general public. 
Under this EEDP, it is recommended that the existing strategic approaches and measures be 
maintained, with further implementation and expansion of measures which have proven to 
be effective. Concurrently, new measures that have proven to be successful in other 
countries will be applied to Thailand. Following intensive consultations with and hearings 
from business, the general public, academic and government sectors, it is proposed that in 
strategically forging ahead with energy conservation policy and overall implementation 
according to this EEDP, importance should be given to the following matters:
 The application of combined measures, i.e. mandatory measures via rules, 
regulations and standards; and promotional and supportive measures via 
incentive provision.
 The introduction of measures which will bring about a wide impact in terms of 
awareness raising and change in energy consumption behavior of energy 
consumers, including decision-making behavior of business operators, as well as 
market transformation, by incorporating innovations into awareness raising 
campaigns and public relations activities, for example, the interrelationship 
between energy conservation and environmental protection as well as global 
warming alleviation.
 Potential and important role of the private sector in the public-private 
partnership to promote and implement energy conservation measures. Dissemination of energy conservation promotion to public and private 
agencies/organizations which are readily equipped with resources and expertise, 
such as power utilities and industrial associations, with backup support from the 
Ministry of Energy.
 The use of professionals and Energy Services Companies (ESCO) as an important 
tool to provide consultancy and to implement energy conservation measures in 
which the use of more advanced technology is involved.
 Increase in self-reliance in indigenously developed technology to reduce 
technological costs and to increase access to energy-efficiency technology, 
including promotion of highly energy-efficient product manufacturing processes.
To implement the plan, five strategic approaches, which are further divided into 16 
specific measures, will be introduced or applied. These measures are of high priority as 
they require low investment capital while yielding high energy saving. The strategic 
approaches and measures are as follows:
(1) Mandatory Requirements via Rules, Regulations and Standards, comprising 
four measures as follows:
(1.1) Enforcement of the Energy Conservation Promotion Act, [as amended up 
to] B.E. 2550 (2007), so that the energy management system through 
energy consumption reporting and verification imposed on designated 
buildings and factories would materialize.
(1.2) Mandatory energy efficiency labeling to provide options for consumers to 
buy or use highly energy-efficient equipment/appliances, vehicles and 
buildings.
(1.3) Enforcement of the Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) for 
equipment/appliances, buildings and vehicles to prevent the distribution 
and use of low energy-efficient products. In this regard, the government 
will consult with product manufacturers and retailers to determine an 
appropriate lead time prior to the enforcement of MEPS for each product.
(1.4) Determination of the Energy Efficiency Resource Standards (EERS), or the 
minimum standards for large energy businesses to implement energy 
conservation measures encouraging their customers to use energy 
efficiently (with a penalty clause for those whose implementation outcome 
is lower than the specified standards and rewards for those whose 
achievement is greater than the specified standards in each year), which 
will be an important mechanism to provide both technical and financial 
assistance to small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
(2) Energy Conservation Promotion and Support, comprising five measures as 
follows:
(2.1) Execution of a “voluntary agreement” to save energy between the public and (2.2) Support and incentive provision to encourage voluntary energyefficiency 
labeling for highly energy-efficient equipment/appliances, buildings and 
vehicles.
(2.3) Promoting traveling by mass transit systems and goods transportation via 
highly energy-efficient logistics systems.
(2.4) Subsidization for investment in the implementation of energy conservation 
measures by (a) providing subsidies for the amount of energy saved which 
can be verified, as per the project proposals approved under the DSM 
Bidding scheme for large-scale businesses, and (b) providing subsidies for 
the amount of energy saved and/or reduction of peak load that can be 
verified or accurately assessed for SMEs, as per the project proposals 
submitted under the Standard Offer Program (SOP) scheme, which requires 
no bidding.
(2.5) Support for the operation of ESCO companies, (e.g. the use of funding from 
the Energy Conservation Promotion Fund to increase credit lines given by 
the ESCO Fund), to alleviate technical and financial risks of entrepreneurs 
wishing to implement energy conservation measures.
(3) Public Awareness (PA) Creation and Behavioral Change, comprising three 
measures as follows:
(3.1) Public relations and provision of knowledge about energy conservation to 
the general public, via the teaching/learning process in educational 
institutions, fostering youth awareness, and other PA activities, such as 
eco-driving.
(3.2) Putting forth the concept and promoting activities related to the 
development of a low carbon society and low carbon economy, which will 
bring about cooperation between local administration organizations and 
the business sector in the planning and implementation of activities that 
will lead to reduction of GHG emissions and efficient use of energy.
(3.3) Determination of energy prices to reflect the actual costs and application of 
tax measures as an important tool to promote energy conservation with a 
view to fostering public awareness and changing their energy consumption 
behavior.
(4) Promotion of Technology Development and Innovation, comprising two 
measures as follows:
(4.1) Promotion of research and development to improve energy efficiency and 
reduce technological costs, particularly those related to equipment/ 
appliances with large markets and having their manufacturing bases in 
Thailand, including the production process, materials as well as buildings 
and housing that are energy efficient.
(4.2) Promotion of demonstrations of energy-efficiency technologies that have (5) Human Resources and Institutional Capability Development, comprising two 
measures as follows:
(5.1) Support for the development of professionals in the energy conservation 
field to be responsible persons for energy management and operation, 
verification and monitoring, consultancy and engineering services provision 
and the planning, supervision and promotion of the implementation of 
energy conservation measures.
(5.2) Support for the development of institutional capability of agencies/ 
organizations in both public and private sectors, responsible for the 
planning, supervision and promotion of the implementation of energy 
conservation measures.
4. Expected Benefits
The investment in energy conservation in each year will result in energy saving and 
cumulative avoided carbon dioxide (CO2) emission in following years throughout the 20-
year period of this EEDP. The cumulative final energy saving up to 2030 will be about 
289,000 ktoe, or an annual average of 14,500 ktoe, and avoided CO2 emission at about 976 
million tons, or an annual average of 49 million tons. In financial terms, the cumulative 
savings in energy expenditure will be approximately 5.4 trillion Baht, or an annual average 
of 272 billion Baht (see Table 2). Within the first five years, the annual energy saving 
achieved, compared with the BAU case, will be about 1,000 ktoe, 1,940 ktoe, 2,910 ktoe, 
3,930 ktoe and5,040 ktoe respectively. The cumulative energy saving will total 14,830 ktoe 
(divided into fuel and electricity at 11,950 ktoe and 33,900 GWh respectively), accounting 
for an annual average of 2,960 ktoe, which is worth 278.54 billion Baht in total or an annual 
average of 55.7 billion Baht. About 50 million tons of avoided CO2 emission, or an annual 
average of 10 million tons, can be achieved. Besides these direct benefits, other indirect 
benefits will also be obtained, such as the environmental quality improvement and a 
positive impact on the macroeconomic arena.

In the first five years, this EEDP will receive funding from the government, especially 
from the Energy Conservation Promotion Fund, totaling 29.5 billion Baht, or an average of 
5.9 billion Baht per year. This implementation budget can be classified by type of 
expenditure as follows: direct funding for energy saving achieved, 20 billion Baht (68%); 
management and public relations activities, 3 billion Baht (10%); infrastructure 
development to accommodate mandatory measures on standards and energy efficiency 
labeling, 1.5 billion Baht (5%); funding for research, development and demonstration work, 
3.5 billion Baht (12%); and human resources and institutional capacity development, 1.5 
billion Baht (5%). If the budget is allocated by economic sector (based on the indicated 
share of primary energy saving target), it will be as follows: the industrial sector, 11 billion 
Baht; the transportation sector, 9.5 billion Baht; and the commercial building and 
residential sector, divided into the large commercial building group, 4 billion Baht, and the 
small commercial building and residential group, 5 billion Baht. In this regard, the 
government’s investment in energy conservation promotion is considered to be cost 
effective, with an average investment of 2,000-6,000 Baht per ton of crude oil equivalent 
(toe) that can be saved.

The promotion and implementation of energy conservation measures in each 
economic sector usually involve various agencies. In particular, for the transportation and 
industrial sectors, of which energy conservation potential is high, concerned ministries with 
direct responsibilities are the Ministry of Transport and Ministry of Industry, while support 
is to be rendered by other ministries, especially the Ministry of Energy. In addition, the 
industrial sector and the commercial building sector will require a high level of involvement 
from private sector entrepreneurs. (Responsible agencies for each measure are shown in 
Chapter 6.)
To achieve the targets specified under this EEDP will, therefore, require cooperation 
and determination of various concerned agencies in both public and private sectors, 
particularly in the following actions which are key factors to success of this plan:
(1) The development of management systems as well as management tools, e.g. the 
development of an energy consumption database and the reporting, verification 
and assessment systems; the establishment of a dedicated independent body with 
flexibility to implement energy conservation promotion measures; and the 
development of a mechanism, at the policy level, to enhance cross-ministry energy 
conservation promotion and monitoring.
(2) Adequate and continuous budget allocation to support work plans and activities 
under the plans, e.g. it can be developed as a rolling plan every 3-5 years.
(3) The development of human resources and institutional capability of concerned 
organizations on a continuous basis to become professional, especially to build up 
personnel with understanding of the concept and business practices of the private 
sector.
(4) Public agencies should take a lead role and should set a good example by 
implementing programs such as the green procurement – to set a policy requiring 
procurement of goods/services which are energy efficient and environmentally 
friendly; the deployment of ESCO services and the implementation of energy-saving 
measures in government buildings.
(5) The determination of energy prices which reflect actual costs and the application 
of tax measures as a tool to promote energy conservation and to reduce GHG 
emissions via raising awareness and changes in energy consumption behavior.
(6) As the assessed energy-saving potential is only slightly higher than the specified 
energy-saving target and as the potential does not include the impact which may 
occur resulting from the industrial restructuring to be less energy-intensive or the 
transportation system restructuring to the rail and mass transit systems (apart 
from the measures stipulated herein), concerned agencies should, therefore, 
explicitly formulate policies and development plans in the long term, which will 
have positive impact on energy consumption.20-Year Energy Efficiency

1.1 Background and Objectives
Energy is an important factor in our daily living, for improving the quality of life 
and for the economic development of the country. In particular, energy demand in 
Thailand, being a developing country, has been increasing continuously. Since indigenous 
energy resources are quite limited, more than half of the national energy demand has to 
depend on energy imports, and the share of energy import dependency tends to be 
increasing, which may affect energy security of the country in the future. In addition, it is 
projected that energy prices will be constantly on the rise, hence creating a greater 
burden on energy consumers and affecting Thailand’s economic competitive edge, as well 
as international trade balance. Apart from energy problems, Thailand has to face a 
further challenge from the environmental impact caused by the use of energy, 
particularly the impact of climate change resulting from global warming. Relevant 
international agreements, coupled with the pressure from Thailand’s trade dialogue 
partners that have stringent policies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, are 
major driving factors for Thailand to gear the national system towards a low-carbon 
energy system.
Currently, it is internationally accepted that energy conservation and energy 
efficiency improvement is an important approach to address the aforementioned 
challenges because relevant measures normally require low initial investment costs and 
most technologies are readily available, so some of these strategies may be implemented 
immediately. From past literature reviews, it is found that there is enormous potential 
for energy efficiency improvement and energy conservation in developing countries. In 
Thailand, the government has introduced various energy conservation measures since 
the enforcement of the Energy Conservation Promotion Act (ENCON Act), B.E. 2535 
(1992). Importantly, funding has been allocated from the Energy Conservation 
Promotion Fund to support the implementation of a number of measures under its 
Energy Conservation Plan, which is a rolling plan, with each phase taking five years to 
complete and it is currently in its 3rd Phase. Some examples of major measures that have 
been implemented are the enforcement of the ENCON Act to promote energy 
management in designated factories and buildings, promotion of energy efficiency labeling 
for electrical equipment/appliances, incentive provision via tax measures and soft loans, 
energy services companies (ESCO), business development and awareness raising 
campaigns on energy saving. A review of the outcomes of energy conservation measures 
implemented has indicated that some measures have resulted in satisfactory energy 
saving, while others have faced with some obstacles during implementation, especially in 
the cross-agency implementation, as well as the issues of continuity of policy and budget 
allocation.
Additionally, the previous Energy Conservation Plans were formulated to serve 
the objectives under the Energy Conservation Promotion Fund only, that is, there has 
been no formulation of an integrated national plan, especially in terms of targets and 
long-term work plans, which will bring together the implementation of all related 
activities of all sectorsThe government has also foreseen that problems concerning energy prices, international competition for energy resources, environmental impact and 
climate change will be exacerbated in the future, which will inevitably affect people’s 
well-being and the national economic competitive edge. Consequently, the government 
has developed this 20-year Energy Efficiency Development Plan (2011-2030), which is in 
line with the declaration of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders in 2007 
to collaborate in energy conservation promotion in order to achieve the agreed target in 
2030. This 20-year EEDP has the following two main objectives:
(1) To set the energy conservation targets for the short term (five years) and for the 
long term (20 years), both at the national level and by the energy-intensive 
economic sectors, i.e. transportation, industry, commercial and residential 
sectors;
(2) To lay down strategies and guidelines promoting energy conservation to 
achieve the specified targets, and to lay down measures and work plans to 
serve as the framework for concerned agencies in formulating their respective 
action plans for energy conservation promotion.
1.2 Development of the 20-Year Energy Efficiency Development Plan 
(2011-2030)
On 17 June 2010, the Ministry of Energy, via the Energy Policy and Planning Office 
(EPPO), granted funding to the Joint Graduate School of Energy and Environment (JGSEE), 
King Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT), for undertaking a study to 
develop an energy efficiency development plan (the Study Team is shown in Appendix A). 
Concurrently, a Committee on the 20-Year Energy Efficiency Plan Development has been 
appointed, chaired by the Permanent Secretary of Energy, with the Deputy Permanent 
Secretary of Energy being Vice Chair and representatives from concerned agencies, both 
within the Ministry of Energy and others, including qualified persons from both public and 
private sectors, being Committee Members. (The order on the appointment of the 
Committee is shown in Appendix B).
The Study Team has assessed energy conservation potential, in technical terms, of 
three major economic sectors, i.e. transportation, industry, commercial building and 
residential sectors, so as to develop the energy conservation targets in the next 20 years, 
and has analyzed the application of various energy conservation promotion measures, 
both domestic and overseas, and then presented the strategies, strategic approaches and 
measures leading to the achievement of the specified energy conservation targets. In this 
connection, the frameworks of short, medium and long-term implementation are put forth 
herein, including the budget framework necessary for the implementation of activities 
pursuant to the first 5-year period of the implementation framework. Additionally, 
assessment has been made of the benefits to be obtained from the implementation 
according to the work plans.
In the development process of this 20-Year EEDP, the Study Team closely consulted 
with concerned agencies, particularly the Energy Policy and Planning Office (EPPO) and the of Energy, as well as the Office of Transport and Traffic Policy and Planning (OTP) under the 
Ministry of Transport. Hearings were organized to obtain opinions from both public and 
private sectors. When the development of the Draft 20-Year EEDP was completed by the 
Study Team, it was reported to the Committee on the 20-Year Energy Efficiency Plan
Development for comment and review. After a preliminary approval had been granted by 
the Committee, five public consultations were organized by the Study Team to obtain 
views from all stakeholders and the general public, covering all regions, i.e. the north 
(Chiang Mai), the south (Songkhla), the northeast (Nakorn Ratchasima), the east (Pattaya) 
and in Bangkok, with a total of 767 participants. After revision had been made by the 
Study Team, taking into consideration comments and recommendations obtained, the 
Final Draft 20-Year EEDP was approved by the Committee at its meeting on 18 April 2011.Chapter 2: Energy Demand Situation and Trend
2.1 Energy Demand Situation in Thailand
In the past two decades, from 1990 to 2010, energy demand in Thailand increased 
continuously at an annual average rate of 4.4%. In 2010, final energy consumption was 
2.3 times the amount it was in 1990, or about 71,000 thousand tons of crude oil 
equivalent (ktoe). The growth rate corresponded with the economic growth rate, of 
which the annual average rate was 4.5%, accounting for the “energy elasticity”
1
at 0.98, 
which is considered quite high when compared with developed countries where energy 
consumption efficiency is higher. The economic sectors for which the energy 
consumption growth rates were much higher than the GDP growth rate were the 
commercial building and industrial sectors, with energy consumption in 2010 being 3.71 
and 3.0 times the amount in 1990 respectively, when compared with the GDP growth 
rate which was 2.36 times only (Figure 2.1).
Figure 2.1: Energy Demand and GDP Growth from 1990 to 2010
In addition to energy elasticity, another index that indicates the efficiency of 
overall energy use of the country is the “energy intensity,” or a ratio of the amount of 
energy used to a unit of GDP, which was on the rise over the past 20 years, except for the 
period 2005-2008 during which oil prices were considerably high (Figure 2.2). This index 
was a bit higher than the world average, but much higher than that of developed 
countries, like Japan and the EU (Figure 2.3). Although the energy intensity indexes of 
large developing countries are higher than that of Thailand, they tend to rapidly 
decrease, and this may affect the economic competitive edge of Thailand in the future.

(Source: Calculated from the data on energy consumption and GDP of World Resources Institute)
2.2 Trend of Future Energy Demand
In the next 20 years, under the assumption that the economic growth will be at a 
base case, i.e. the GDP (at 1988 constant value) will grow at an annual average rate of 
4.2% and that the population will grow at an annual average rate of 0.3%, without any 
significant change in the energy consumption structure, such as industrial restructuring, 
and without any special energy conservation measures introduced (the business-as-usual 
or BAU case), energy demand tends to continuously increase to 151,000 ktoe, or about 
2.1 times the present amount, accounting for an annual average growth rate of 3.9% 
(Figure 2.4), with the average energy elasticity at 0.93. Energy demand in the commercial 
and industrial sectors will still increase at a higher rate than other sectors and higher than the GDP growth rate (Figure 2.4). The forecast energy demand growth in each economic 
sector is illustrated in Figure 2.5.
Figure 2.4: Trend of Future Energy Demand under the BAU case
Figure 2.5: Energy Demand and GDP Growth from 2010 to 20302.3 Major Energy Challenges
Given the aforementioned present energy demand situation and the continuously 
increasing trend of energy demand, it is predicted that Thailand may have to face the 
following major challenges in the future:
(1) Energy supply security since there will be vigorous international competition 
for natural energy resources, especially with the larger developing countries for
which the demand growth rate is considerably high.
(2) Continuously increasing energy cost due to the rapidly increasing demand as 
mentioned in (1) and greater difficulty of energy production since natural 
reserve amounts are being depleted, coupled with increasing environmental 
cost in the production process as well as the geo-political problems of major oil 
producing countries in the Middle East and North Africa.
(3) Greater dependency on energy imports because domestic energy resources 
are being depleted, particularly natural gas in the Gulf of Thailand. This will 
increase the burden in terms of trade balance, which will lead to problems of 
national security and economic competitiveness.
(4) Increasing pollution emissions resulting from the use of fossil fuels for heat 
and electricity generation and for transportation, which will entail an increasing 
cost to maintain the environmental quality, especially in industrial estates, in 
case there is no application of cleaner fuels or no improvement of energy 
efficiency.
(5) Increasing volume of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission since the percentage of fossil 
fuel dependency is still high – at present, the use of fossil fuels is more than 80% of 
the total energy demand and accounts for 90% of the energy used for power 
generation – hence, CO2 emission from the energy sector accounts for 70% of the 
total emissions. In order to alleviate the climate change problem, Thailand, 
particularly Thai businesses, may have to contend with the pressure to limit CO2
emission due to international agreements or bilateral agreements, i.e. the 
requirement from goods importing countries, or due to the measures introduced 
in many countries to provide options for consumers to choose goods or services 
with a low carbon footprint, including the demand of domestic consumers.Chapter 3: Energy Conservation Potential
There may be a variety of measures to address the major five energy challenges, 
as mentioned in Chapter 2, for example, promotion of renewable energy utilization. 
However, the option which requires low investment cost and for which relevant 
technologies are more readily in place than other options is “Energy Conservation” which, 
in the context of this 20-Year Energy Efficiency Plan means (1) economical use or reduced 
expendable use of energy, and (2) energy efficiency improvement, i.e. doing the same 
activities with less energy use, involving, among others, lighting, hot water production, 
cooling systems, transportation or machine operation in the manufacturing process. 
Although the government has so far implemented a number of energy conservation 
promotion measures, there remains great potential to save more energy, according to 
the outcome of potential assessments which will be discussed in detail later. Energy 
conservation is, therefore, an important option of almost all countries, including 
developed countries where energy efficiency is already high. In addition, energy 
efficiency improvement is an important means to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions. It is reported by the International Energy Agency (IEA) that energy efficiency is 
crucial to prevent global warming and will significantly contribute to GHG emission 
reduction by more than 50% by the year 2030 (Figure 3.1).

In addition, at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in 2007 in 
Sydney, APEC Leaders jointly issued the Sydney Declaration stipulating, among others, 
the target for energy conservation with a view to strengthening regional energy security 
and addressing climate change problems, by reducing “energy intensity,” or the amount 
of energy used per unit of GDP, by 25% by the year 2030, compared with the 2005 base 
year. Thailand also ratified the declaration.
Since Thailand’s energy intensity in 2005 was 16.2 ktoe (thousand tons of crude oil 
equivalent) per billion baht GDP (at 1988 constant value), if Thailand is determined to 
implement energy conservation measures pursuant to this declaration, the overall energy intensity of the country in 2030 must not exceed 12.1 ktoe per billion baht GDP, or the 
final energy consumption in that year must not exceed 121,000 ktoe (under the 
assumption that the annual economic growth rate will be at 4.2% on average). That is, 
energy demand must be about 30,000 ktoe lower than that in the business-as-usual 
(BAU) case, or 20% lower than the demand in the BAU case (Figure 3.2).
Figure 3.2: Energy Saving Amount to Be Achieved by Thailand by 2030 
in pursuance of the APEC Leaders’ Declaration
(EI = Energy Intensity)
Consequently, in order to ensure that Thailand will have the potential to achieve 
the energy conservation target as stipulated in the declaration, it is necessary to assess 
energy conservation potential both at the national level, as a whole, and at the individual 
economic sector level.
3.1 Potential Assessment Approach
In 2009, major economic sectors comprised industrial, commercial and residential 
building and transportation sectors, altogether accounting for over 94% of the total final 
energy consumption of the country, as shown in Table 3.1.
Table 3.1: Final Energy Consumption by Economic Sector in 2009[2]

Transportation 24,132 36
Industry 23,798 36
Commercial Building & Residential 15,029 22
Others 3,739 6
Total 66,339 100As a result, the assessment of energy conservation potential of the country will 
focus on these three main economic sectors.
3.1.1 Industrial Sector
The assessment of energy conservation potential in the industrial sector is divided 
into five main clusters, i.e. non-metal, food & beverage, basic metal, chemical, and paper. 
These clusters account for the largest share of energy consumption, i.e. over 84% of the 
total energy consumption in the industrial sector in 2009, as shown in Table 3.2.
Table 3.2: Energy Consumption by Industrial Cluster in 2009 [2]

Paper 1,836 8
Basic metal 1,030 4
Others 3,202 16
Total 23,195 100
The energy conservation potential, in technical terms, of each industrial cluster is 
roughly assessed by comparing Thailand’s current average specific energy consumption 
(SEC), or the amount of energy used per unit of products in each cluster, with the best 
SEC or best practice in foreign countries or with the best practice in Thailand (in case no 
comparable foreign best practice is available). The best SEC derived will be set as the 
target for energy efficiency improvement in respective industrial clusters in the next 20 
years. When considered jointly with the forecast product outputs up to 2030, the 
assessment of overall energy conservation potential in each year up to 2030 can be 
made.
3.1.2 Commercial Building and Residential Sector
The assessment of energy conservation potential in the commercial building and
residential sector is divided into two groups, i.e. (1) the large commercial building group 
and (2) the small commercial building and residential group, due to their different energy 
consumption characteristics.
Large Commercial Building Group
For the assessment of energy conservation potential in the large commercial 
building group, the energy consumed is divided into electricity and fuel. Electricity 
consumption in 2007 by eight major building types is shown in Table 3.3.Table 3.3: Electricity Consumption in 2007 in the Large Commercial Building Group

Medical center 1,172 6
Educational institution 1,102 6
Other general buildings 1,365 8
Total 19,125 100
The assessment of electricity saving potential is based on the comparison 
between the average energy consumption rate/space unit/year of individual building 
types at present, called the “Reference Case,” and such a rate in the case where the 
minimum energy consumption efficiency standard of buildings, or “Building Energy Code
(BEC),” is enforced, including the case where a higher standard in the future is enforced. 
The average energy consumption rate under the Reference Case is derived from the 
energy consumption modeling representing each building type, based on the official data 
from energy consumption inspection. Energy efficiency standards which are higher than 
the BEC comprise the following three levels:
(1) HEPS (High Energy Performance Standard) – the high energy efficiency 
standard of various systems which can be achievable by using current 
technologies; 
(2) Econ (Economic building) – the target in the near future when the 
technologies of equipment and various systems are developed to be 
more energy efficient, but are still cost-effective; and 
(3) ZEB (Zero Energy Building) – the long-term target when the need for 
external energy supply to the buildings is near zero because the energy 
demand of such buildings is very low and there is also on-site energy 
generation from renewable energy. 
The parameters that are modified or changed to achieve greater energy 
efficiency are the heat transmission via building envelope, air-conditioning efficiency, 
lighting and electrical equipment/appliance efficiency, and air ventilation.
Based on the modeling, the adjustment of the mentioned parameters under 
each level of energy saving capability will result in the net energy consumption of each 
building type, as shown in Table 3.4. It can be noticed that the level of energy 
consumption under the ZEB Case is only 1/4 - 1/3 of energy consumption under the 
Reference Case. This reflects the energy conservation opportunity of each building type.Table 3.4: Net Energy Consumption Derived from Modeling Each Building Type under 
Each Level of Energy Saving Capability.

With regard to the energy conservation potential assessment in terms of fuel, 
only liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is taken into consideration as the use of liquid fuel, 
such as fuel oil and diesel, is quite insignificant. LPG consumption by each commercial 
building type in 2007 is shown in Table 3.5.

The assessment of fuel saving potential is based on the comparison between 
the average efficiency of various types of equipment using LPG, which are available in the 
market and are currently in use, and the possible highest efficiency of such equipment 
which can be achieved by using currently available technologies or those to be developed 
in the future.
Small Commercial Building and Residential Group
Since the government has not yet determined the energy performance 
standard of the small commercial building and residential group, the assessment of 
energy conservation potential of this group is based mainly on the forecast utilization of higher energy-efficient equipment/appliances, for which energy utilization is divided into 
five categories as follows:
1) Lighting -- fluorescent tubes and incandescent bulbs;
2) News & Entertainment -- color televisions, VDO/VCD/DVD players, 
stereos, radios and computers;
3) Cooking – rice cookers, electric stoves, electric pans, microwave ovens, 
electric ovens, electric kettles, blenders and toasters. Fuels used under 
this category comprise cooking gas (LPG), charcoal and firewood, 
including the use of electric power;
4) Comfort – electric fans, air-conditioners, vacuum cleaners, washing 
machines, water heaters, water pumps, electric irons and refrigerators;
5) Others.
The above data will help indicate the dispersion of energy efficiency of 
equipment/appliances available now in the market and those being in use at present; and 
from the data, the mean (average) of energy efficiency of the present equipment/appliances
can be deduced. The difference between the possible highest efficiency of such 
equipment using currently available or future technologies and the current efficiency of 
the equipment in use, coupled with the forecast volume of the equipment to be in use up 
to 2030, will reflect the energy conservation potential under this group.
3.1.3 Transportation Sector
Energy conservation in the transportation sector can be divided into three major 
approaches, i.e. (1) improvement of energy efficiency of motor vehicles, (2) energy 
efficiency improvement by shifting the modes of travel or goods transport, and (3) energy 
efficiency improvement by travel demand management (TDM). Energy saving potential 
of each approach can be analyzed as follows.
Improvement of Energy Efficiency of Motor Vehicles
In assessing energy conservation potential by improving energy efficiency of 
motor vehicles, the vehicles to be considered are divided into: (1) new vehicles and (2) 
existing vehicles in the transport system (or “on-road” vehicles). The assessment is based 
on the difference between the fuel consumption rate of vehicles under present 
conditions and the reduced fuel consumption rate as a result of improved energy 
efficiency, and on the estimated increasing number of vehicles up to 2030.
With regard to new vehicles, major assumptions include: (1) the types of 
vehicles to be assessed will be based on those in use at present, comprising private cars, 
private trucks, fixed-route buses, non fixed-route buses and trucks; and (2) the present 
fuel economy (kilometre/litre) of current vehicles and improved vehicles in the future, 
with reference to Japan’s fuel economy improvement direction, which is expected to 
increase by 20% by 2030.Additionally, in assessing the energy efficiency improvement potential of 
motorcycles, the share of electric motorcycles has been increased, replacing part of the 
ordinary internal combustion engine motorcycles. Key assumptions applied here are that 
more than 70% of energy saving can be achieved by an electric motorcycle, compared 
with an ordinary one, according to the study outcome in foreign countries, and that the 
share of electric motorcycles sold in 2030 will be 70% of new motorcycles. As a result, in 
2030 the cumulative number of electric motorcycles will account for about 60% of the 
total number of motorcycles, which is equal to the share of electric motorcycles in China 
at present.[6]
With regard to the potential assessment of on-road vehicles, consideration is 
focused on the change in driving behavior to “eco-driving,” involving gentle speed 
acceleration and slowdown, driving at an appropriate and constant speed, switching off 
the engine while the vehicle is stationary (idling stop), and engine & vehicle maintenance 
to keep the vehicle in a good working condition, including the use of auxiliary equipment 
contributing to eco-driving. The types of vehicles considered in this potential assessment 
comprise five types, the same as those of new vehicles. A major assumption applied here 
is that the eco-driving promotion will result in an increase of vehicle energy efficiency by 
about 10%. (According to an IEA study, such an increase is in a range of 5-10%.) [7]
Energy Efficiency Improvement by Shifting the Modes of Travel and Goods Transport
Among various transport modes, land transport is the mode in which the rate 
of energy consumption per transport volume is the highest. Within land transport, 
traveling by private cars is the form of transport that has the highest rate of energy 
consumption per transport volume, compared with other forms of passenger transport 
by land. When compared with the travel by public transport systems, such as buses and 
rail systems, the rate of energy consumption of private cars is 2.8 and 5.5 times that of 
buses and public rail systems respectively. The rate of energy consumption for goods 
transport by trucks is 3.1 times higher than that by waterway and about 10 times higher 
than that by rail.[8]
The assessment of energy saving potential as a result of a travel and goods 
transport mode shift is divided into two scenarios, i.e. urban zone and intercity zone. For 
the urban zones, the assessment is made with reference to the outcomes of relevant 
studies commissioned by the Office of Transport and Traffic Policy and Planning (OTP), 
Ministry of Transport, i.e. the Mass Rapid Transit Master Plan in Bangkok Metropolitan 
Region: M-MaP,[9] the Report on Integrated Plan of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) System Routing 
Network in Bangkok Metropolitan Region,
[10] and the Project on Master Plan and 
Preliminary Design of Mass Transit System for Chiang Mai City,[11] in which comparisons 
of travel modes are made under the Base Case.
Energy Efficiency Improvement by Travel Demand Management
Travel demand management (TDM) generally means a measure or a set of 
measures introduced to change travel behavior and travel demand of a person to be in 
such a way that it contributes to higher efficiency in the transport system as a whole.[12] 
TDM measures can be divided into three groups: (1) measures supporting travel modes 
with a high transport rate per vehicle (Vehicle Occupancy); (2) measures creating incentives or difficulties to reduce travel demand; and (3) measures promoting 
alternative activities instead of traveling.
Examples of measures in the first group, supporting travel modes which will 
contribute to traveling with high vehicle occupancy or require low energy consumption 
per travel, are: the provision of “Park-and-Ride” areas in the suburbs, increase in 
convenience to connect mass transit systems with other transport systems, and discounts 
on public transport system fees during off-peak hours.
Examples of measures in the second group, creating incentives or difficulties 
to reduce travel demand, are: the collection of charges for the use of roads (“road 
pricing”) in heavily congested areas, limitation of car-parking areas or collection of high 
parking fees in city central areas, annual license plate taxation according to the distance 
travelled per year, and prohibition of driving into inner-city areas on odd/even dates 
based on car plate numbers. As for the third group, promoting alternative activities 
instead of traveling, some examples are: promotion of the use of information technology 
(IT) to support the work instead of traveling, and promotion of working from home.
In this connection, the introduction of TDM measures will be effective and 
acceptable to users of private vehicles only if and when the services of public transport 
systems (especially rail systems) can be widely accessible and are rapid and convenient. 
3.2 Outcome of Energy Conservation Potential Assessment
3.2.1 Industrial Sector
The outcome of the assessment of energy conservation potential in the industrial 
sector is shown, by industrial cluster, in Table 3.6. Overall, the potential in this sector is 
about 13,790 ktoe, accounting for 22% of the forecast energy demand in 2030 under the 
BAU case. The food and beverage cluster has the highest saving potential, i.e. 5,370 ktoe, 
or 28% of the forecast demand. Next to it are the non-metal, paper and chemical 
clusters, with energy saving potential of 2,500 ktoe, 2,110 ktoe and 1,370 ktoe 
respectively. The basic metal cluster has the least potential, i.e. 300 ktoe. With regard to 
energy saving potential in other industrial clusters, of which the energy demand share 
altogether is about 15% of the total energy demand in this sector and which involve a 
variety of small industries, if it is deduced that energy saving potential is equal to that of 
the other five major clusters, i.e. 22%, the potential of this cluster will be 2,140 ktoe.Table 3.6: Energy Saving Potential by Industrial Cluster

3.2.2 Commercial Building & Residential Sector
Large Commercial Building Group
The outcome of the electricity saving potential assessment in the large 
commercial building group is shown in Table 3.7. It indicates that office buildings, 
educational institutions, department stores and hotels have higher potential than other 
building types. As for the assessment of fuel saving potential, the outcome is shown in 
Table 3.8. It is found that the use of LPG burners has a high saving potential, i.e. 354 ktoe.

The outcomes of electricity and fuel saving potential assessment in the small 
commercial building and residential group are shown in Tables 3.9 and 3.10 respectively. 
Electricity saving potential in this group is derived from the use of fluorescent tubes, 
electronic ballasts, compact fluorescent lamps, air-conditioners and water heaters, of 
which energy efficiency is higher, with the following assumptions:
(1) Fluorescent tubes – the change from former 36-watt tubes to energysaving 30-watt tubes, using the same magnetic ballast, can save energy 
at about 30%.
(2) Electronic ballasts – replacing 10-watt magnetic ballasts with 1-watt 
electronic ballasts can save energy at about 90%.
(3) Compact fluorescent lamps, replacing incandescent lamps, contribute 
to energy saving at about 80%.
(4) Air-conditioners – the change from existing units with EER 8 to those 
with EER 13 will contribute to about 33% energy saving. For new airconditioners distributed in the market, the change from former EER 11 
to EER 13 will contribute to about 15% energy saving. In addition, 
consideration is also given to the supplementary application of airconditioning by solar energy (“Solar Cooling”), which will help achieve 
energy saving, in total, at about 50% of the energy amount required for 
this equipment.
(5) Water heaters – the shift to use heat-pump water heaters will result in 
100% energy saving.
In this regard, the use of high energy-efficiency air-conditioners and water 
heaters will have the highest energy saving potential.

current 49% to 65% by 2030; the use of firewood in 2030 is expected to be totally 
replaced by charcoal as the latter is more convenient for use, and hence a higher demand 
for charcoal in 2030, while the efficiency of charcoal stoves is expected to increase from 
currently 25% to 30% in 2030. The derived outcome of this potential assessment is 
shown in Table 3.10.

The overall energy conservation potential in the commercial building and
residential sector in 2030 can be summarized in Table 3.11. It will be noticed that both 
large commercial building and small commercial building and residential groups have a 
high electricity saving potential. The total potential in this sector is about 6,410 ktoe.

3.2.3 Transportation Sector
In the transportation sector, the total energy saving potential, in technical terms, 
is 16,250 ktoe, or about 35% of the forecast energy demand in 2030. The potential is 
derived from the following: 12,470 ktoe, or 77% of the total potential, from the use of 
higher energy-efficient vehicles and efficient use of vehicles; 2,770 ktoe, or 17%, from the 
travel and goods transport mode shift; and 1,010 ktoe, or 6%, from the application of 
Travel Demand Management (TDM) measures, as shown in Table 3.12.Table 3.12: Energy Conservation Potential in the Transportation Sector

Use of Higher Energy-Efficient Vehicles and Efficient Use of Vehicles
Using higher energy-efficient vehicles, in the case of new vehicles, will result 
in an enormous energy conservation potential of 8,413 ktoe. Most of the potential will 
be derived from the use of private cars, vans and pick-ups, trucks and motorcycles, as 
illustrated in Table 3.13. Measures contributing to the shift to use higher energy-efficient 
vehicles may include the mandatory energy efficiency labeling, the enforcement of 
Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) and the application of CO2 emission tax 
measures in order to boost the production and distribution of higher energy-efficient 
vehicles. Regarding the use of old vehicles, or “on-road vehicles,” the energy saving 
potential is also quite high, i.e. 4,053 ktoe, as shown in Table 3.14. The potential is 
mainly derived from eco-driving, e.g. gentle speed acceleration and slowdown, driving at 
an appropriate and constant speed, switching off the engine while the vehicle is 
stationary (idling stop), etc.

Development Plan (2011-2030)
4.1 Energy Conservation Targets
In determining the targets for energy conservation in this 20-Year Energy 
Efficiency Development Plan (EEDP), the following two major factors have been taken 
into consideration:
(1) The international agreement on energy conservation targets, i.e. the Joint 
Declaration of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders,
agreeing to reduce energy intensity (EI), or the amount of energy used per 
unit of GDP, by 25% in the year 2030 compared with that in 2005. If Thailand 
is determined to achieve the mentioned energy conservation target, 
Thailand’s final energy consumption in 2030 must be reduced by 20%, 
compared with the demand under the BAU case, or about 30,000 ktoe.
(2) According to the outcome of energy conservation potential assessment, in 
technical terms, in the three major economic sectors, it is found that energy 
demand can be reduced, in total, by 36,450 ktoe, which is 22.5% higher than 
the target specified in (1).
From the above-mentioned two factors, it can be deduced that Thailand has 
energy conservation potential to achieve the mutually agreed target of APEC. Hence, if 
the target is distributed among those major economic sectors, based on the assessed 
potential shares, the target of each economic sector will be as shown in Table 4.1.

In the case where energy conservation measures can be successfully implemented 
up until the target specified under this plan is achieved, energy consumption up to 2030 
will increase at only an annual average rate of 3.0%, or an increase of only 1.7 times the 
current demand (Figure 4.1). The growth rate will be lower than the GDP growth rate, 
accounting for the average energy elasticity at 0.71 over the next 20 years, compared with 
the average of 0.98 over the past 20 years.50,000

4.2 Strategies to Achieve the Targets
Following intensive consultations with and hearings from business, the general 
public, academic and government sectors, it is suggested that in strategically forging 
ahead with energy conservation policy and overall implementation according to this 
EEDP, importance should be given to the following matters:
Strategy 1: The application of combined measures, i.e. mandatory measures 
via rules, regulations and standards; and promotional and 
supportive measures via incentive provision.
Strategy 2: The introduction of measures which will bring about a wide 
impact in terms of awareness raising and change in energy 
consumption behavior of energy consumers, including decisionmaking behavior of business operators, as well as market 
transformation, by incorporating innovations into awareness 
raising campaigns and public relations activities, for example, the 
interrelationship between energy conservation and 
environmental protection as well as global warming alleviation.
Strategy 3: Potential and important role of the private sector in the publicprivate partnership to promote and implement energy 
conservation measures.
Strategy 4: Distribution of energy conservation promotion work to public 
and private agencies/organizations which are readily equipped 
with resources and expertise, such as power utilities and 
industrial associations, with backup support from the Ministry of 
Energy.Strategy 5: The use of professionals and Energy Services Companies (ESCO) 
as an important tool to provide consultancy and to implement 
energy conservation measures in which the use of more 
advanced technology is involved.
Strategy 6: Increase in self-reliance on indigenously developed technology to 
reduce technological costs and to increase access to energyefficiency technology, including promotion of highly energyefficient product manufacturing businesses.
4.3 Strategic Approaches, Measures and Work Plans
4.3.1 Strategic Approaches and Measures to Achieve the Targets
In previous Energy Conservation Programs, both mandatory and supportive 
strategic approaches and measures were introduced, i.e. rules/regulations and provision 
of financial incentives, technical assistance and knowledge, including various forms of 
public awareness campaigns to create energy conservation awareness of the general 
public. Under this 20-Year EEDP, it is recommended that the existing strategic 
approaches and measures be maintained, with further implementation and expansion of 
measures which have proven to be effective. Concurrently, new measures that have 
proven to be successful in other countries should be considered for application to 
Thailand.
To implement the plan, five strategic approaches, which are further divided into 
16 specific measures, will be applied. These measures are of high priority as they require 
low investment capital while yielding high energy saving. The strategic approaches and 
measures are as follows:
Strategic Approach 1: Mandatory Requirements via Rules, Regulations and 
Standards
Strategic Approach 2: Energy Conservation Promotion and Support
Strategic Approach 3: Public Awareness (PA) Creation and Behavioral Change
Strategic Approach 4: Promotion of Technology Development and Innovations
Strategic Approach 5: Human Resources and Institutional Capability 
Development
(1) Mandatory Requirements via Rules, Regulations and Standards, comprising 
four measures as follows:
(1.1) Enforcement of the Energy Conservation Promotion Act, [as amended 
up to] B.E. 2550 (2007), so that the energy management system through 
energy consumption reporting and verification imposed on designated 
buildings and factories would materialize.(1.2) Mandatory energy efficiency labeling to provide options for consumers 
to buy or use highly energy-efficient equipment/appliances, vehicles 
and buildings.
(1.3) Enforcement of the Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) 
for equipment/appliances, buildings and vehicles to prevent the 
distribution and use of low energy-efficient products. In this regard, the 
government will consult with product manufacturers and sellers to 
determine an appropriate lead time prior to the enforcement of MEPS 
for each product.
(1.4) Determination of the Energy Efficiency Resource Standards (EERS), or 
the minimum standards for large energy businesses to implement 
energy conservation measures encouraging their customers to use 
energy efficiently (with a penalty clause for those whose 
implementation outcome is lower than the specified standards and 
rewards for those whose achievement is greater than the specified 
standards in each year), which will be an important mechanism to 
provide both technical and financial assistance to small and medium 
enterprises (SMEs).
(2) Energy Conservation Promotion and Support, comprising five measures as 
follows:
(2.1) Execution of a “voluntary agreement” to save energy between the public 
and commercial/industrial sectors, especially various business associations 
and large-scale businesses.
(2.2) Support and incentive provision to encourage voluntary energyefficiency labeling for highly energy-efficient equipment/appliances, 
buildings and vehicles.
(2.3) Promoting traveling by mass transit systems and goods transportation 
via highly energy-efficient logistics systems.
(2.4) Subsidization for investment in the implementation of energy 
conservation measures by (a) providing subsidies for the amount of 
energy saved which can be verified, as per the project proposals 
approved under the DSM Bidding scheme for large-scale businesses, 
and (b) providing subsidies for the amount of energy saved and/or 
reduction of peak load that can be verified or accurately assessed for 
SMEs, as per the project proposals submitted under the Standard Offer 
Program (SOP) scheme, which requires no bidding.
(2.5) Support for the operation of ESCO companies, (e.g. the use of funds
from the Energy Conservation Promotion Fund to increase credit lines 
given by the ESCO Fund), to alleviate technical and financial risks of 
entrepreneurs wishing to implement energy conservation measures.
(3) Public Awareness (PA) Creation and Behavioral Change, comprising three 
measures as follows:
(3.1) Public relations and provision of knowledge about energy conservation 
to the general public, via the teaching/learning process in educational institutions, fostering youth awareness, and other PA activities, such as 
eco-driving.
(3.2) Putting forth the concept and promoting activities related to the 
development of low carbon society and low carbon economy, which will 
bring about cooperation between local administration organizations 
and the business sector in the planning and implementation of activities 
that will lead to reduction of GHG emissions and efficient use of energy.
(3.3) Determination of energy prices to reflect the actual costs and 
application of tax measures as an important tool to promote energy 
conservation with a view to fostering public awareness and changing 
their energy consumption behavior.
(4) Promotion of Technology Development and Innovations, comprising two 
measures as follows:
(4.1) Promotion of research and development to improve energy efficiency 
and reduce technological costs, particularly those related to equipment/ 
appliances with large markets and having their manufacturing bases in 
Thailand, including the production process, materials as well as 
buildings and housing that are energy efficient.
(4.2) Promotion of demonstrations of energy-efficiency technology that has 
been technically proven but has not been commercialized in the 
domestic market, including support for necessary preparation to 
materialize wide commercial deployment of such technology.
(5) Human Resources and Institutional Capability Development, comprising 
two measures as follows:
(5.1) Support for the development of professionals in the energy 
conservation field to be persons responsible for energy management 
and operation, verification and monitoring, consultancy and engineering 
services provision, and the planning, supervision and promotion of the 
implementation of energy conservation measures.
(5.2) Support for the development of institutional capability of agencies/ 
organizations in both public and private sectors, responsible for the 
planning, supervision and promotion of the implementation of energy 
conservation measures.
4.3.2 Framework of Energy Conservation Measures and Work Plans by Economic Sector
The framework of measures and work plans under this 20-Year Energy Efficiency 
Development Plan are divided into three phases – short term (2011-2015), medium term 
(2016-2020) and long term (2021-2030), with specified activities under each phase of 
each work plan for individual economic sectors so as to steer the implementation 
pursuant to the strategic approaches towards the achievement of targets specified under 
each phase of the EEDP, as shown in Tables 4.2-4.6.Table 4.2: Framework of Cross-sector Measures and Work Plans

targets.
2) Support Agency (in regular letters) means an agency providing support to the Focal 
Agency in the implementation pursuant to the strategic approaches and measures to 
achieve specified targets.
6.2 Success Factors
To achieve the targets specified under this EEDP will need cooperation and 
determination of various concerned agencies in both public and private sectors, 
particularly in the following actions which are key factors to the success of this plan:
(1) The development of management systems as well as management tools, e.g. 
the development of an energy consumption database and the reporting, 
verification and assessment systems; the establishment of a dedicated 
independent body with flexibility to implement energy conservation promotion 
measures; and the development of a mechanism, at the policy level, to enhance 
cross-ministry energy conservation promotion and monitoring.
(2) Adequate and continuous budget allocation to support work plans and activities 
under the plans, e.g. it can be developed as a rolling plan every 3-5 years.
(3) The development of human resources and institutional capability of concerned 
organizations on a continuous basis to become professional, especially to build 
up personnel with understanding of the concept and business practices of the 
private sector.(4) Public agencies should take a lead role and should set a good example in such 
implementation as the green procurement – to set a policy requiring 
procurement of goods/services which are energy efficient and environmentally 
friendly; the deployment of ESCO services and the implementation of energysaving measures in government buildings.
(5) The determination of energy prices which reflect actual costs and the 
application of tax measures as a tool to promote energy conservation and to 
reduce GHG emissions.
(6) As the assessed energy-saving potential is only slightly higher than the specified 
energy-saving target and as the potential does not include the impact which 
may occur resulting from the industrial restructuring to be less energy-intensive 
or the transportation system restructuring to the rail and mass transit systems, 
concerned agencies should, therefore, explicitly formulate policies and 
development plans in the long term, with due consideration for the impact on 
energy consumption. APPENDIX A
