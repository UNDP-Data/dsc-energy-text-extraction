Results and resources framework for Sudan (2018-2021) .............................. 9I. Programme rationale
1. The Republic of the Sudan is Africa's third largest country, with a surface area of 
1,886,068 km² and a population estimated at almost 42 million in 2017.
1 The country has a 
low human development index (HDI) of 0.49.
2 The poverty rate is 46.5 per cent. Rural areas 
are home to 66 per cent of the population and 57.6 per cent of the poor. Important regional 
disparities exist, with a 26 per cent poverty rate in Khartoum state compared to 62.7 per cent
in Darfur.
3 The loss of around 75 per cent of oil revenues,4
following secession of the South 
in 2011 and two decades of economic sanctions, have exacerbated this trend.
2. Unsustainable debt burden, a volatile security situation, lengthy political transition, 
fragile relations with the international community and adverse climate change have 
constrained growth prospects and poverty reduction efforts.
5 This situation is contributing to 
prolonged conflict, a key driver of the complex displacement crisis, with approximately 
2.3 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) and 500,000 Sudanese refugees.
6 This reality
is gradually undermining social cohesion and exacerbating existing governance challenges, 
such as land ownership and provision of basic services. Communities are caught in a 
negative vulnerability spiral, exposed to increasing risks, disrupted livelihoods and reduced 
resilience. Disparities contribute to vulnerability, particularly affecting the poorest and most 
resource-deprived. Although gender-disaggregated data is limited, conflict has 
disproportionally affected women and increased their vulnerability to exploitation.7
3. Efforts are underway to address conflict and political exclusion. The Government 
launched national dialogue in 2014, with participation of a wide range of parties and 
factions. An agreement was reached in October 2016 that will form the basis of the 
upcoming permanent constitution. In addition, sanctions against the country have eased since 
early 2017. If fully lifted, it will help Sudan achieve its development potential, with its
abundant livestock, fertile lands, large deposits of minerals, and significant human capital. 
This potential underpins the Government´s 2030 vision,
8
aimed to achieve the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs). This country programme will support implementation of the 
country’s sustainable development priorities to operationalize the 2030 vision for 2018-
2021. Priorities include peacebuilding, governance, poverty reduction, environment and 
improved basic services. 
4. Greater capacities, transparency, accountability and inclusiveness in planning, allocation 
and management of resources are key components of reforms. Since the 1990s, Sudan has 
embarked on decentralization reforms to optimize basic service delivery and strengthen 
accountability at the subnational level. Results remain limited, however, because fiscal
decentralization has not engendered more balanced distribution of resources to address 
disparities across states and reduce poverty gaps.
9 A case in point is inadequate access to the 
formal justice system, which perpetuates vulnerability among civilians, especially at the 
periphery. Additionally, there is low awareness of the rule of law and human rights and a 
prevalence of sexual and gender-based violence in conflict-ridden areas, such as Darfur, with
limited capacities to address it.

5. Although conflict levels have fallen in Darfur,
11 the security situation there and in other 
parts of Sudan remains volatile owing to criminality, small arms proliferation and the 
regional context.
12 Conflicts in Darfur, Abyei, Blue Nile and South Kordofan have
diminished trust between communities, disrupted livelihoods and broken down traditional 
conflict resolution mechanisms. The protracted displacement crisis has increased
urbanization and competition within and between tribal groups over community boundaries, 
land ownership and livestock routes. Women and youth have been particularly affected. 
While youth have the potential to drive development, the pressure of making a living and 
lack of voice can become a destabilizing factor.
13
6. Climate change exacerbates such community-based conflicts caused by poor natural 
resource management policies and harmful practices, such as deforestation, overgrazing and 
soil erosion. Most rural households are dependent on pastoral and rain-fed practices,
14 with 
desertification an increasing threat.
15 Women carry out the bulk of the work on small farms, 
making them highly vulnerable to economic losses resulting from natural hazards. Without 
effective adaptation and disaster risk reduction measures, smallholder farmers and 
pastoralists will continue to migrate to the towns, increasing stress on cities. Lack of access 
to electricity and clean energy services is another poverty driver. A UNDP study on 
commodities concluded that the main challenges to developing inclusive value chains are
climate change and lack of access to affordable energy.
16
7. A contributing factor to low HDI is the shortage in basic services, including health, with
only 24 per cent of primary health-care facilities providing essential services.
17 Diseases 
such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS exacerbate vulnerability. Over 95 per cent of 
health facilities has only partial access to energy, severely affecting their capacity to provide 
services and store the limited amount of medicine the Government can procure under 
economic sanctions. 
8. Based on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) experience, where joint action to 
support their achievement came late,
18 UNDP is endeavouring to roll out of the SDG agenda
from the onset. Building on South-South cooperation, it aims to prioritize, accelerate, 
mainstream, localize and monitor the SDGs more methodically, using enhanced instruments. 
The 2016 mainstreaming, acceleration and policy support (MAPS) mission provided early 
concrete recommendations on key possible accelerators and on advancing the humanitariandevelopment-peace nexus.
9. UNDP support to rule of law and access to justice in Darfur and the eastern states has 
increased human rights awareness and the number of cases handled by justice institutions, 
paralegals and traditional mechanisms. Nevertheless, more specific targeting of victims of
sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) was recommended.
19 This work would have 
benefitted from a more integrated approach with justice institutions and peace
infrastructures, and stronger linkages with the informal justice system.

21
10. UNDP contributed to stabilization in Sudan by supporting local peace agreements in the 
previous two cycles in the east, the border states of the south and Darfur, and by engaging in
reintegration of ex-combatants,
22 local conflict resolution, and livelihood generation for
women and youth at-risk. This work will continue to prevent recurrence of conflict and 
support peace dividends,
23 focused on peace infrastructures and strengthening rule of law 
institutions.
24 Furthermore, development organizations, including UNDP, need to better 
address the long-term development needs of IDPs and host communities, through durable 
solutions, based on the humanitarian-development-peace nexus and through improved 
coordination with the highest authorities of the state.
25
 
11. UNDP successfully implemented climate change adaptation measures in four states, 
achieving an increase of 50 to 150 per cent in productivity of crops, such as sorghum and 
sesame, and improved livelihoods of farmers and pastoralists, of whom more than 60 per 
cent are women,
26 with micro-finance support. UNDP supported the development of nine 
strategic plans and national implementation frameworks, such as biodiversity and low carbon 
development, thereby making Sudan eligible for increased financing in priority areas such as 
clean energy and natural resource management.
12. As the interim principal recipient of the Global Fund for Malaria, Tuberculosis and 
HIV/AIDS since 2005, UNDP contributed to keeping HIV/AIDS prevalence under 1 per 
cent and success rates for treated tuberculosis cases at 81 per cent, with deaths halved to 
2.5 per cent per 100,000 people. Over 2.1 million cases of malaria were treated and 
16 million bed nets distributed.
27 Based on this successful partnership, the Government
requested UNDP support in procuring essential medicine and solar energy for health 
services.
28
13. Building on the previous cycle’s results, UNDP will use its comparative advantage to 
support country programme implementation and reverse the vulnerability spiral. This 
includes its solid relationship with the Government at all levels, access to vertical funds,
long-term presence in the relatively neglected east and north and difficult-to-reach areas such 
as the ‘three-areas’,29 wide network and partnerships, unique know-how as management and 
administrative agent, regional approach to transnational issues, and coordination role. More 
specifically, UNDP is coordinating the SDG roll-out drive and has a leading role in the New 
Way of Working commitment reached at the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit. These
efforts will reinforce the humanitarian-development-peace nexus to strengthen the country’s 
transition from humanitarian assistance to recovery and sustainable development.
II. Programme priorities and partnerships 
14. Aligned with the Government’s development priorities, the United Nations 
Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF), 2018-2021, and the multi-year humanitarian 
strategy, the country programme will focus on four development priorities, informed by the

three acceleration areas recommended by the MAPS mission: increasing agricultural 
productivity, advancing gender equality, and reducing conflicts aimed at enhancing
community resilience. UNDP will ensure adequate geographical balance, emphasize gender 
mainstreaming and capacity building, and focus on those furthest behind. The first two 
development priorities will be informed by SDGs 1, 5, 10, 16 and 17.
15. UNDP will support a dedicated SDG initiative, in coordination with the United Nations 
country team and in partnership with the National Development and Population Council and 
the Ministry of International Cooperation (MIC). The initiative will align with national 
priorities, focusing on the accelerators,
30 and the localization and enhancement of data 
collection and reporting, including through the UNDP-supported government database on
aid management, which will help inform the country programme priorities.
Development priority 1. Improving governance and rule of law
16. Starting in Darfur, UNDP will work closely with government, the United Nations-Africa 
Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID), the United Nations country team, civil society and 
local communities to strengthen the institutional capacity of rule of law and human rights 
institutions. This will include revising selected laws and procedures, re-establishing the 
criminal justice chain in pilot areas of IDP return, addressing land disputes and building the 
capacity of justice and security institutions. The programme will factor in gender differential 
needs to legally empower women. UNDP will support national institutions, civil society 
organizations (CSOs), community-based organizations (CBOs), native administration and 
paralegals to promote democratic processes, accountability, mediation and legal aid, and 
strengthen understanding of human rights, particularly on sexual and gender-based violence.
17. UNDP will support improvement of local planning and capacities for service delivery.
The World Bank and the African Development Bank will address needed reform issues at 
the federal level. At state level, UNDP will support public financial management systems 
and the World Bank will support revenue collection systems.
Development priority 2. Community stabilization
18. UNDP will support peace efforts to stabilize communities and strengthen social 
cohesion in at least 10 states. It will continue to support the European Union and UNAMID 
in internal dialogues in Darfur to advocate for dividends of peace, promote civic 
engagement, and work on reintegration component of the disarmament, demobilization and 
reintegration process for ex-combatants in Darfur and in the border states of the south, with 
an equal focus on host communities. UNDP will scale up and enhance skills and capacities
of youth and women more specifically for post-conflict livelihoods and economic recovery, 
notably through a value-chain approach.
19. UNDP will strengthen local infrastructures for peace, informed by the women, peace 
and security agenda, to prevent violent conflict through shared resource management. In 
doing so, it will build the capacity of humanitarian and peacebuilding implementing partners, 
through the Sudan Humanitarian Fund (SHF) and the Darfur Community Peace and Stability 
Fund. In addition, UNDP will cooperate with the Government in identifying drivers of 
violent extremism among youth, addressing them through advocacy and targeted
programming.
20. Under the Government’s leadership, a durable solutions strategy is being prepared, 
focused on in-depth understanding of IDP demographic and socioeconomic profiles, 
strengthened coordination with authorities, long-term support and equal focus on host 
communities.
31 In view of the volatile situation in South Sudan and the recent influx of 
refugees to East Darfur, White Nile, and South and West Kordofan, UNDP will provide

SudanApril 2017basic socioeconomic infrastructure and livelihood assistance to host communities in noncamp settings. This builds on the success of the support programme of UNDP and the Office 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to refugees and host 
communities in the east, with more direct partnership with the highest central authorities.
Development priority 3. Addressing vulnerability to climate change
21. UNDP will root its poverty reduction work in its efforts to support adaptation to climate 
change, employment and equitable access to natural resources in rural areas, in line with 
SDGs 1, 2, 5, 7, 10 and 13. UNDP will scale up its successful adaptation measures from four 
to 13 states to build resilience to climate change and disaster risks in the agriculture and 
water sectors. This includes improved seed varieties and new measures for water harvesting, 
which will accelerate productivity, increase income and improve livelihoods of the most 
vulnerable. UNDP will work with the Ministry of Environment, Higher Council for 
Environment and Natural Resources (HCENR), United Nations Environment Programme 
(UNEP), World Bank, local government and communities in monitoring climate change,
including through early warning.
22. UNDP will support inclusive, gender-sensitive policies for clean energy systems and 
sustainable natural resource management. It will invest in value-chain market development
for cash crops such as groundnut, sesame and sorghum, in partnership with the Food and 
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and World Food Programme (WFP).
Should the lifting of sanctions hold, UNDP will strongly engage the private sector to 
improve access to services for the rural poor, including microfinance.
Development priority 4. Promoting equitable access to basic services
23. In line with SDG 3 and 17, UNDP will continue to build the capacities of health 
institutions to improve access to services related to HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, 
through its role as recipient of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, 
and strengthen gender-sensitive health policies and facilities. In partnership with United 
Nations organizations, UNDP will support social protection safety nets to extend access to
most vulnerable populations, such as people living with HIV/AIDS and with disabilities and 
IDPs. 
24. In partnership with the Ministry of Health and line ministries, and based on SDG 7, 
UNDP will support solar energy supply, mainly rural health facilities, to enable provision of 
essential services to the poor. UNDP will continue assisting the Ministry of Health in 
procuring essential medicines and providing life-saving support under the sanctions regime.
III. Programme and risk management 
25. This country programme outlines UNDP contributions to national results and serves as 
the primary unit of accountability to the Executive Board for results alignment and resources 
assigned to the programme at country level. The country programme accountability of 
managers at the country, regional and headquarter levels is prescribed in the organization’s 
programme and operations policies and procedures and the internal control framework. In 
accordance with Executive Board decision 2013/9, all direct costs associated with project 
implementation should be charged to the concerned projects.
26. The country programme will be nationally executed. If necessary, national execution 
may be replaced by direct execution for part or all of the programme in situations of force 
majeure. At project level, national implementation will be the priority modality. Direct 
implementation will be considered in circumstances related to limited capacities and donor 
concerns. It will be accompanied by targeted national capacity development efforts and 
direct agreements with national authorities. UNDP social and environmental standards will DP/DCP/SDN/3
be applied, as well as the harmonized approach to cash transfers, in coordination with other 
United Nations organizations, to manage financial risks.
27. The next programme cycle will likely witness a drawdown of UNAMID in Darfur
following the February 2017 strategic review mission. Based on early joint planning, UNDP 
will seek to gradually expand its programmes, building on the joint UNDP/UNAMID rule of 
law programme, as part of the shift from peacekeeping to peacebuilding. Given the tasks 
involved, UNDP will seek additional expertise and capacities to support this transition 
planning process.
28. Protracted violent conflict remains a programme risk, particularly in border states with 
South Sudan. UNDP is stepping up its collaboration with the Government and UNHCR, 
focused on livelihoods, to cater to current needs and possible future stress on local
communities, with the likely increase in refugees, and to promote stabilization in affected 
areas. In addition, UNDP will continue to manage the three humanitarian, peacebuilding and 
development funds – the Sudan Humanitarian Fund, the Darfur Community Peace and 
Stability Fund and the Qatar-supported United Nations Darfur Fund – allowing UNDP to 
strengthen links between humanitarian, peacebuilding and development interventions, in line 
with the New Way of Working. 
29. Climate change is an endemic risk. UNDP is strengthening national early warning 
systems through a national disaster risk reduction strategy, creation of a disaster loss and 
damage data centre, and nation-wide equipment installation.
30. Resource mobilization is a major challenge for development aid in Sudan. The prospect 
of sanctions lifting may open new development opportunities, for example, in the area of
extractive industries, value-chain development and bio-tourism. UNDP will seek new 
funding avenues and galvanize partnerships with the private sector, new vertical funds (such 
as the Green Climate Fund), and multilateral development banks, such as the Islamic 
Development Bank and the African Development Bank on the SDGs and sustainable energy.
Should sanctions remain, UNDP will explore programmatic mitigation measures, such as 
supporting the Ministry of Health in procuring essential medicines.
31. Successful programmatic measurement will rely on updated, reliable disaggregated data
and improved targeting of policies and programmes. The MDG final report, the national 
household survey and the poverty reduction strategy paper, however, are all overdue, with 
data dating from 2009. Mitigation measures include a collective push for publication of these 
reference documents and launching of new data and capacity-building initiatives.
32. The country office will remain flexible to adjust to new priorities, following possible
lifting of sanctions, constitutional revisions, endorsement of the next UNDP strategic plan, 
2018-2021, and wider United Nations reforms. 
IV. Monitoring and evaluation
33. The Government and UNDP are committed to results-based management, supported by
strong monitoring and evaluation. Reliable data is challenging and costly. Building on 
previous work on the country’s statistical system32 and other data sources, such as the multiindicator cluster survey, UNDP and the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) have developed a 
vulnerability proxy indicator to provide sex and age-disaggregated vulnerability data at 
national, state and local levels and allow proper targeting of priority groups (IDPs, women 
and youth). The vulnerability proxy indicator uses innovative, low-cost methods of data 
collection, such as satellite imagery and big data, based on mobile phone records. The 2016 
household baseline survey will, if approved, provide baseline data. These systems will 
support SDG localization and monitoring.
 
32 African Development Bank
UNDP and the World Bank34. The gender marker, the UNDP accountability tool for gender equality, was rolled out in 
2015 to improve gender-sensitive planning, targeting and monitoring. It will rely on the 2016 
gender analysis and 2017 gender strategy.
35. UNDP will evaluate projects at least once per cycle, and allocate 2 to 5 per cent of 
budgets for monitoring and 1 per cent for communication. 
36. To ensure its continued thought leadership and programme effectiveness, UNDP will 
emphasize evidence-based programming. Early in the new programme cycle, UNDP will 
carry out studies of emerging trends impacting Sudan and the Horn of Africa, such as 
migration and displacement, youth as agents-of-change and prevention of violent extremism, 
in collaboration with the Government and through South-South cooperation. 
37. To mainstream innovative practices across its programme and beyond, UNDP will 
establish an innovation lab to generate pioneering, citizen-centric, design-led development 
approaches and create alternative space for cutting-edge research, ideation and testing. The 
organization will explore possibilities for support through South-South and triangular 
cooperation.DP/DCP/SDN/3
