Background 
Energy is one of the essential drivers for social and economic development. A 
sustainable energy supply, both in the short and the long term, is needed for enhancing 
economic development, people's quality of life and protecting the environment. 
Availability of quality energy could augment the productivity and the effective supply of 
physical and/or human capital services. Advanced industrialized countries are able to 
use modern machinery and techniques for increasing the capital-labour ratio and 
productivity of the workers because of the availability of required amount of energy. 
Per capita energy consumption of Nepal is low. It is only about 15 Gigajoule and used 
mainly in non-productive sectors. Present practices of energy consumption are neither 
sustainable nor economical. Country is suffering with the acute shortage of reliable 
energy supply. Energy supply is managed by separate entities which are working with 
different principles, objectives, regulatory and institutional mechanism. About two third of 
the total national energy comes from fuel wood that are managed by the Ministry of 
Forests and Soil Conservation. National Grid Electricity supply is being managed by 
Nepal Electricity Authority under the Ministry of Energy. Ministry of Environment looks 
after the promotion and development of alternative energy resources. Nepal Oil 
Corporation, under the Ministry of Commerce and Supply manage the petroleum imports 
and sales within the country. Ministry of Industry is responsible for exploring and 
developing the coal resources. That has created challenges to establish effective 
coordination mechanism among the institutions for integrated planning of the energy 
sector and also in implementing the planned activities. 
Government of Nepal has initiated to formulate the National Energy Strategy (NES) to 
address the challenges as well as for the development and utilization of energy 
resources in sustainable manner. 
The preparation of National Energy Strategy was started in 2007 and completed in two 
phases. The first phase of the study assessed and analysed the energy sector issues at 
national and regional level. Five regional consultative workshops were organized in five 
development regions of the country represented by energy sector stakeholders including 
supply side and demand side. The identified energy sector issues were grouped into 
different category such as general issues, specific issues, issues of traditional, 
commercial and renewable energy etc. 
The second phase of the energy strategy preparation included the analysis of future 
energy supply and demand side by fuel types and economic sectors. Future energy 
demand was assessed for three possible economic growth scenarios of the country. 
Energy requirement at the business as usual economic growth scenario (3.9% average 
GDP growth), medium growth scenario (5.6% average GDP growth) and accelerated 
growth scenario (8.6% average GDP growth) were assessed up to the strategic horizon 
of 2030. In each scenario, the energy mix up to 2030 were assessed to understand the 
changes of energy consumption pattern with time. Future energy demands were 
assessed using different computer based programme namely the MARKAL (Market 
Allocation Model) and MAED-2 (Model for Analysis of Energy Demand). 
After identifying the future energy demand and energy mix for different time line, the 
strategic programmes and activities were designed for each category of the energy resources. The designed programme and activities were finalized by incorporating the 
suggestions from regional consultation workshops held in five development regions and 
national consultation workshop held in Kathmandu. 
Global Energy Scenario 
The world energy demand increased by about 3% between 2007 and 2008 reaching 
about 12267 Mtoe. In 2008, fossil fuels accounted for 81% of the global production (IEA, 
2010a). In recent years, the growth of the coal has steeply risen and the growth of oil has 
been much weaker. Among non fossil fuel sources, biomass and other combustible 
renewable occupies about 10% share in global energy production. Nuclear and hydro 
resources contribute about 6% and 2% of the total production respectively. Other 
renewable represents about 1% of the total production with pronounced growth rate. 
The world's Total Primary Energy Supply (TPES) has more than doubled in 2008 
compared to 1971. Oil is the dominant fuel in 2008, reducing its share from 44% in 1971 
to 33%, whereas gas increased from 16% to 21% and nuclear from 1% to 6% during the 
same period. The share of coal is increasing constantly in the recent years reaching the 
highest level (27%) since 1971. 
Industry is the largest energy consuming sector accounting about 37% of the world total 
final energy consumption. More than one fourth (about 27%) of the total final 
consumption goes for transport sector followed by residential sector (about 24%), 
commercial and services (about 8%), agriculture (about 2%) and others (2%). 
The total final consumption of energy was about 8428.41 Million Ton Oil Equivalent 
(Mtoe) in 2008 at global level (IEA, 2010a). Globally, fossil fuels remained the dominant 
source of energy, accounting more than two third of the total energy consumption. Oil is 
the single largest fuel in the primary energy mix in 2008 followed by gas and coal 
resources. Biomass and other combustible renewable accounted for about 13% of the 
total final consumption. Other renewable namely the geothermal, solar, wind etc. had a 
nominal contribution in the global energy system.

The primary energy consumption, if policy measures are not taken, is projected to 
increase by 1.6 percent per year between 2004 and 2030, reaching 17.1 billion tons of oil 
equivalent (IEA, 2006). The average projected rate of growth is, nevertheless, slower 
than that over the period of 1980-2004, when demand grew by 1.8 percent per year. The 
pace of demand growth slackens progressively over the projection period: in the period 
2004-2015, it grows by 2.1 percent. By 2015, total global energy demand is one-quarter 
higher than in 2004. The rate of growth drops to 1.3 percent in 2015 -2030.

Oil is the world’s vital source of energy and will remain so for many years to come, even 
under the most optimistic assumptions of the pace of development and deployment of 
alternative technology. The sources of oil to meet rising demand, the cost of producing 
and the prices that consumers will need to pay for are extremely uncertain. The surge in 
oil prices in recent years coupled with much greater short-term price volatility, have 
 highlighted sensitiveness of the prices to short-term market imbalances. This situation 
has also alerted people to the ultimately finite nature of oil (and natural gas) resources. 
Global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions increase slightly faster than primary 
energy use, because the fuel mix becomes more carbon-intensive. The power sector 
contributes around half the increase in emissions from 2004 to 2030. Coal remains the 
leading contributor to global emissions over the outlook period.

Per capita energy consumption, in general, and the electricity which is an advanced and 
fine form of energy, in particular, has strong positive correlation with socio-economic 
prosperity. It can be clearly seen from the relations between per capita GDP and per 
capita energy consumption and per capita GDP and per capita electricity consumption as 
well as the HDI and per capita electricity consumption. 
Figure 4: Relation between Per Capita GDP and Electricity Consumption

Figure 5: Relation between Per Capita GDP and Electricity Consumption Source: IEA, 2008 and UNDP, 2009 
In the regional context, the per capita primary energy supply of Nepal is only 14 Giga 
Joule (GJ), which is one of the lowest values just above Bangladesh. Nepal's 
consumption is one fifth of the world's average and less than half of the asian average. 
The per capita consumption in China and India are 75 GJ and 22 GJ respectively. 
Figure 6: Per capita total primary energy supply by countries and regions In the context of electricity consumption, Nepals per capita consumption is 90 KWh (IEA, 
2010). The asian average is 719 KWh. China has the highest per capita electricity 
consumption of 2471 KWh in the region. 
Figure 7: Per capita electricity consumption by countries and regions 
Total primary energy supply per GDP production (GJ per thousand of 2000 USD) is very 
high (56 GJ) in Nepal compared to other countries of Asia as well as at the region. This 
indicates the most inefficient energy use in term of GDP production. 
Figure 8: Total primary energy supply per GDP (GJ/thousand 2000 USD) 
 National Energy Scenario 
Nepal's energy resources are broadly divided into three categories: Traditional, 
Commercial and Alternative. Traditional energy resources include all types of biomass 
resources that are used for energy production with conventional practices. All the energy 
resources with well established market prices are grouped into commercial energy 
category, whereas, indigenous renewable energy resources are grouped into alternative 
category. 
1.1.1 Traditional Energy Resources 
The common biomass fuels that fall under the classification of traditional energy (TE) 
include only the solid biomass fuels derived from plants and animals. Both woody and 
non-woody biomass derived from shrub and grass lands, forests, agricultural lands (crop 
harvesting and processing residues), as well as residues of animals in the form of 
excreta (mostly cattle dung) are under traditional category. Recently the charred 
materials of some wild shrubs and other loose biomass materials were being 
compressed into biomass briquettes for energy. 
1.1.1.1 Wood fuel Resources 
Wood fuels consist of woody biomass, i.e. stems, branches, twigs, etc., saw dust, other 
residues from logging and wood processing activities, as well as charcoal from these 
sources. The primary sources of wood fuels are both forest and non-forest land. Forest 
and other wooded land include natural forests (including degraded forests), shrub lands, 
wood and timber plantations, woodlots, grasslands and non cultivated inclusion. Nonforest land includes agricultural land, agro-forestry systems, road side plantation, home 
gardens, etc. 
Currently, accessible National Forests (areas with more than 10% crown cover) and 
shrub lands (areas with less than 10% crown cover) as well as private and community 
forests, tree plantations in block or linear lines, play a crucial role in fuel wood supply. 
These forests could be natural in origin or in the form of tree plantations, in blocks, lines 
or as scattered trees in public and community lands. Besides, private forests, and trees, 
including trees grown in non-forest lands of different types also contribute to both locally 
consumed and commercially traded fuel wood production. 
All forests, excluding private forests, whether marked or unmarked with forest boundary 
markers are treated as national forests, including waste or uncultivated lands, 
unregistered lands surrounded by or adjoining to forests, as well as paths, ponds, lakes, 
rivers or streams and riverine lands within forests. The legal definition of forest, 
according to Ministry of Forest and Soil Conservation-Department of Forest (MFSCDoF), in 1999, includes all fully or partly covered areas by trees, including land use types 
such as Forest, Shrub land, Grassland, Non-cultivated inclusions, and other lands. 
Except the cultivated land, which is mostly registered under private or institutional 
ownership, all other land use types are owned and managed by the forestry or other 
related agencies in the public sector. 
Nepal’s forest resources have been regulated by Forest Act, 1993 and Forest Regulation 
1995. This law and regulation has classified the forest into two broad categories for the 
management purpose. Such categories are National forests and Private forests. Nepal's 
current forest policy and legislation make a provision to earmark the national forests into 
a number of categories namely the Community forest, Leasehold forest, Government managed forest, Religious forest and the protected forest. Such categories were made to 
support the management purpose of the forests. Collaborative Forest regime is also 
added in Nepalese forest management system through the government directive. 
Additionally, buffer zone of the protected areas are also providing large amount of fuel 
wood resources for locals. National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act (1973) and 
Regulation has also categorized different forest type namely the Buffer zone Community 
forest, Buffer zone Leasehold Forest and Buffer zone Religious Forest and Buffer zone 
private forest. 
Forest land, shrub land, grass land, non-cultivated inclusion and cultivated land are the 
major land use types in Nepal where forests and tree resources exists in different 
intensity. The remaining land uses are grouped into other land category that includes 
water bodies, ice and snow coverage, rocky slopes etc. 
Status of Forest Resources in Nepal 
Forest and tree resources of Nepal were assessed in different time period. Some 
assessment was made in terms of area whereas some other assessment was made 
both in area and stock level. The first assessment of the forest resources goes back to 
1960s covering the Terai and adjoining Hill districts of Nepal. The second assessment 
was made only in terms of area for the year 1978/79 from Land Resource Mapping 
Project (LRMP). MPFS (1988) assessed the forest resources both in area and stock with 
some field study for the year 1985/86. Another assessment was done during 1987 to 
1998 from DFRS with the support from Government of Finland. District wise forest 
statistics was also estimated by JAFTA in 2001 analysing the remote sensing image. 
Assessment to find the area coverage of 20 Terai districts was completed in 2004. 
Forest Resources Assessment Project is being conducted by DFRS with the support 
from Government of Finland using LiDAR technology. 
About 6.4 million hectares of forest and shrub-land was assessed for the year 1964/65, 
out of which, about 58% was covered by crown, 6% by shrub-land and remaining area 
was not covered by crown within the forest land and about 17% wass found within the 
lower stocking level. About 42% forest was found in medium stocking and remaining 
41% forest was highly stocked in the same duration. 
The area assessment of the forest up to district level was completed for the year 
1978/79. This second assessment was based on aerial photo interpretation. Land 
Resources Mapping Project (LRMP) estimated the area coverage of each land category. 
WECS (1988) had carried out a detail analysis of aerial photo of the 1978/79 and 
classified the land use. About 42% of the total land was found under forest and shrubland categories. Trees and woody plants were found in their natural state in such land 
types. The second largest land use was cultivated land which was about 20% of the total 
land surface of that time. Grassland occupied about 12% of the total, whereas, shrubland was just about 4%. Snow cover, ice cover, rocky land, water surface etc. were 
grouped into other land category which was about 18% of the total.

The forest of Nepal was estimated to be 5.5 million ha or 37.4% of the total area of the 
country. Figure 2.4 shows the distribution of forests by physiographic region. The 
Department of Forest Research and Survey with the support from Finland had completed 
assessment of forest resources both in area and stock perspective in 1999. During this 
assessment both the aerial photograph and satellite images were analyzed to estimate 
the forest and shrub coverage. Summary of the forest inventory is presented in table 1.4.

The recent study shows that forest in the twenty Terai districts including protected areas 
cover around 1.39 million hectares (DoF, 2005). The productive forests in these regions 
have a significant role not only in the economic development of the country, but also in 
sustaining rural livelihoods. Table 2.11 provides information on forest statistics of 20

Sustainable Wood and Fuelwood Production 
Estimating fuelwood supply and demand involves many variables, both physical and 
socio economical. The productivity of land varies from time and space and therefore, the 
amount of wood producing land is very difficult to estimate. Consumption is also different 
in different parts of the country and is difficult to measure. Table 1.8 provides the 
sustainable fuel-wood supply information by land use and development region in the 
year 1978/79. Table 8: Sustainable Fuelwood Supply from Accessible Land Areas (1978/79)

In the LRMP data, the non cultivated inclusion areas (NCI) which includes forests, 
shrubs and other land use were too small to map at a scale of 1:50,000. Therefore, 
estimating supply of fuel-wood from NCI, the yield per hectare used for shrub land (i.e, 
0.69 tons/ha/year) is adopted for both the forest and shrub. 
Sustainable Fuelwood Supply in 2008/09 
The sustainable supply of fuel-wood from reachable area of all type of land resources for 
the year 2008/09 is presented in Table 1.9. The sustainable supply was about 12.5 
million tons for the same year. This estimate is significantly different than the earlier 
estimation because it includes the community forest as the managed forest regime which 
has almost double or more annual wood yields as compared to the productivity of 
unmanaged natural forests. This report is further based on the proportion of timber yield 
and fuelwood yield equal to 25% and 75% respectively of the total annual wood yield.

Forest land contributes more than three fourth of the total sustainable fuelwood 
production in the country. Furthermore, cultivated land supplies 9.3%, NCI 5.5%, shrub 
land 4.5% and grassland 0.4% respectively. 
The highest fuel-wood production comes from EDR supplying about 27% of the total 
production of community forests. About one-fourth of the supply comes from MWDR 
followed by CDR, WDR and FWDR respectively. Extraction and consumption of the fuelwood derived from community forest can be different than that of its sustainable 
production. 
1.1.1.2 Animal Dung Production potential 
Where both woody and herbaceous biomass supply sources are scarce, not sufficient to 
meet the traditional energy needs of the people, there, historically animal excreta, mostly gobar (cow dung) were used as a source of energy. The cow dung either in a dried cake 
form or mixed with other left over herbaceous biomass like cattle shade refuses and 
twigs and turned into stick form, has been the important traditional energy supplement in 
areas located away from the remaining forests, mostly in the Terai belt of western, 
central and eastern Nepal. 
WECS' estimate of annual dung supply potential for energy, only in the form of dung 
(excluding bio-gas generation potential) is given in table 2.29. The table exhibits the total 
dung production by development region and physiographic region for the year 2008/09. 
Total production is about 14.9 million tons that is enough to meet about 40% of the total 
energy requirement of the country. However availability of the dung is just around 80% of 
the total production in the country. The estimate was derived based on annual dung 
production per unit of animal in dry form; the total animal population included only the 
existing cattle and buffalo’s heads in 2008/09 in different development regions of the 
country. 
Animal waste, particularly dung, is the second most important sources of indigenous 
energy and occupied also second largest position in terms of primary energy 
consumption. Animal dung in dried cake form has been the common energy for the poor, 
even if the energy content in dung is very low due to high moisture content. Recently, 
this biomass has been used for generating methane gas through anaerobic digestion. 
This modern form of energy produced from animal dung has become very popular. The 
number of new biogas digester establishment has reached more than 2,00,000 plants to 
date.

Animal waste particularly dung is not only the second largest source of indigenous 
energy but it also occupies the second largest position in consumption terms. Dung 
cakes are the poorest form of energy and are regarded as the energy of the poor. 
However, if animal waste in the form of dung is used in a biogas plant, it turns into a 
clean form of energy without any adverse effects to the environment and agricultural 
production. Figure 1.10 shows the total supply potential of animal dung in different 
physiographic region for the year 2008/09, that can be used either in the form of dung 
cake to produce energy or in the form of compost manure to use in agriculture land. This 
data has considered the availability factor of animal dung in Mountain, Hills and Terai 
region are 50%, 75% and 100% respectively. Out of 14.9 million tons of total production, 
about 12.2 million tons is available for utilization. It is, therefore, around 82% of the total 
dung production can be considered for availability for the utilization purpose. 
About 40% of the total energy requirement of the country can be met by animal dung 
alone if used only for energy purposeAbout 15% of the total potential of dung production has already been used for energy purpose, which effects the agricultural 
system of rural Nepal as subsistence oriented farming system heavily depends on 
animal dung for agricultural productivity.

1.1.1.3 Agricultural Residue Production Potential 
In rural areas, where national forests does not exist anymore and wood-fuel supply is 
limited, the field and processing residues of crops such as paddy, maize, wheat, millets, 
oil seeds, grain legumes, jute etc, in dry, solid form, have become the important 
alternative fuels to the traditional users for domestic energy (cooking and heating). The 
agricultural residue production potential is provided, in table 1.12.

The third largest indigenous biomass source of energy in terms of consumption is 
agricultural residues, which directly come from the agricultural crops. Two types of 
residues are generally considered for energy purpose, one is field residue generated 
during the crop harvesting and another is process residue derived as the by-product during the agro processing. Residues collected at the field just after harvesting the main 
crops are named with field residues. Residues coming from agro-processing are called 
process residues such as rice husk, maize cob, wheat barn, etc. Figure 1.11 shows the 
contribution of individual crops in total residue production in the country. Paddy is the 
largest contributor in terms of crop residue production providing about 47% of the total 
residues. Maize gives around one quarter of the total residue production followed by 
wheat, sugarcane, grain legumes and millets respectively. Just three crops namely the 
paddy, wheat and maize provides more than three-forth of the total residue production. 
This figure has considered both the field residues and process residues of major crop 
types for assessing the agricultural residues at national level.

Supply potential of agricultural residues is estimated at 19.4 million tons for the year 
2008/09. This amount is equivalent to 243 million GJ in terms of energy, which is about 
61% of the total energy consumption of the same year. Table 1.13 shows the energy

1.1.2.1 Hydro-Energy Resources 
The first Hydropower development in Nepal started with the commissioning of Pharping 
Power Plant in 1911 located on the right bank of Bagmati River in the South of 
Kathmandu valley. This power plant with a capacity of 500 KW was inaugurated on 22nd 
May 1911. The second hydropower plant was established in 1934 with an installed 
capacity of 900KW at Sundarijal. This power plant is still in operation and producing 
640KW. Third hydropower plant with capacity of 1600 KW was constructed in 1942 at 
Chisang Khola (Morang district) in the private sector by Morang Hydro electric Company. 
It later was damaged due to several landslides (Pradhan, 2006). 
Prior to 1960, the hydropower stations were constructed through grant aid. Panauti 
(2.4MW) from former USSR, Trisuli (18 MW), Devighat (14.1 MW), Gandak (15 MW) and 
Surajpura-Kosi (20MW) from India and Sunkoshi (10MW) from China. Since 1970, 
bilateral and multilateral funding were available for hydropower development. The major 
donor countries in the period were Japan, Norway, Germany and South Korea including 
Canada, Finland, Denmark, Sweden and USA. The lending agencies were the World 
Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB), Japan Bank for Industrial Corporation (JBIC) 
former Overseas Economic Co-operative Fund (OECF), Saudi Fund for Development, 
Kuwait Fund and others. From the 1990's subsequent to the adoption of the policy of 
economic liberalization, hydropower development took a new turn with the private sector 
entering the arena (MOWR, 2004). 
Hydropower Potential 
Nepal's theoretical hydropower potential has been estimated at about 83,000 MW and its 
technically and economically feasible potential of about 45,000 MW and 42,000 MW 
respectively. Table 1.14 summarizes the theoretical hydropower potential classified 
within the major river system in Nepal, while Table 1.15 and Table 1.16 illustrate 
technically and economically feasible potential. The Karnali and Mahakali river systems 
represent approximately 43 percent of theoretical hydropower potential and 55 percent of 
the technical/economical potential.

The above estimates are based on Dr. Hariman Shrestha's doctoral thesis prepared in 1966 
(Shrestha, H.M., 1966). 
Hydropower Generation and Supply System 
Nepal, till date, has total installed capacity of 689.3 MW (Privately owned microhydropower plants not included). Out of which, Independent Power Procedures (IPP) 
contribute 158.3 MW. Table 1.17 gives the current power plants in the country. In 
addition to power being supplied by the indigenous hydropower plants, around 50MW of 
power is being imported from India (Vidyut, 2064). 
Four more hydropower plants with a total installed capacity of 353.4 MW are under 
construction. Chameliya (30MW) and Kulekhani-III (14MW) are planned to be completed 
in 2011 and 2010/11 ??respectively (NEA, 2009).

Nepal Electricity Authority is primarily responsible for planning, construction and 
operations for electricity supply. Presently, there are various Independent Power 
Producers (IPPs), who generate electricity and under the Power Purchase Agreement 
with NEA sell the bulk power to NEA. NEA is also in the process of unbundling and 
there will be separate entities for generation, transmission and distribution as envisaged 
in National Water Plan 2005. 
Power Demand Forecast 
The Power demand projection for INPS has been carried out by NEA considering the 
Power consumption date of FY 2006, macro-economic indicators and rural electrification 
programs (Table 1.18).

Power Demand –Supply Imbalance 
Presently, the NEA system is supply deficit. This is being evident from load shedding 
being implemented for last several years. Data of fiscal year 2007/08 revealed that, the 
peak power supply demand in wet season and dry season were 640 MW/542 MW and 
720 MW / 308 MW respectively, resulting into load shedding of above 30 hours a week. 
This kind of load shedding due to supply deficit is to continue till substantial generation of 
hydropower is added to the system. 
 Transmission and Distribution 
NEA is operating at system voltage levels of 132 kV and 66 kV. Increasing load 
demands have created load saturation in some sectors of these transmission lines 
leading to poor regulation and reliability at the supply terminals resulting in high technical 
losses. The projects like the Middle Marshyangdi would require augmentation in the 
current carrying capacity of the major 132 kV network and construction of some 220 kV 
lines. The urgently needed 220 kV sections are Hetauda – Bardghat and Khimti – 
Dhalkebar. The Khimti – Dhalkebar 220 kV transmission line is under construction. 
Presently, Hetauda-Bharatpur 220 kV transmission Line land associated substations are 
under implementation. After completion, this will ease transmission congestion in 
Hetauda-Bharatpur corridor. In addition to the above several Grid Substation 
Reinforcement Project, Chandranigahpur System Reinforcement Project, Kawasoti 132 
kV Substation Project are also under execution (NEA, 2007/08). NEA is also constructing 
three power exchange links, namely, Butwal-Sunauli, Parwanipur–Birganj and 
Dhalkebar–Bhittamod at the 132 kV level to enhance the transfer capability of the NepalIndia cross border interconnections (MOWR, 2004). Besides, it has recently completed transmission line route alignment survey of a) Duhabi-Purnia 400 kV, 90 km, b) ButwalGorkhapur 400 kV, 100 km and c) Dhalkebar-Mujaffarpur 400 kV, 140 km. 
At present, the Integrated Nepal Power System (INPS) consists of 1,132 km of 132 kV 
single circuit, 412.1 km of 132 kV double circuit, 231.46 Km of 66 kV single circuit, 161.3 
Km of 66 kV double circuit, 22 Km of 66 kV and 132 double circuit, 3.37 Km of 66 kV four 
circuit and 2,362 km of 33 kV single circuit transmission line. Total sub-station capacity 
of the system is 902.45 MVA. All the Head Quarters of 75 districts of the country are 
provided with electricity (NEA, 2006). The remaining areas are being progressively 
electrified. 
Petroleum and Natural Gas 
The Government of Nepal has signed two Petroleum agreements with Cairns Energy 
PLC, UK in 2004 for the petroleum explorations in the Blocks 1 (Dhangadi), 2 (Karnali), 4 
(Lumbini), 6 (Birgunj), and 7 (Malangawa). Though the company has started its 
preliminary study and planning for conducting exploration works in its acreage but the 
actual exploration work has not been initiated. All the petroleum products consumed in 
Nepal are imported from India or overseas in the refined form for direct consumption. 
Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC) is the sole organization responsible for the import and 
distribution of petroleum products. The NOC has storage facility for all the essential 
petroleum fuels, except for LPG. LPG is bottled and distributed by private companies 
around all parts of the country. Table 1.20 provides the petroleum storage capacity all 
over the country.

Nepal has some sporadic deposits of low-grade lignitic coal. A very small amount of the 
total coal supply is extracted in Dang district for consumption in brick industries. For the 
major supply, coal is imported from India and abroad. Nepal Coal Limited was the sole 
agency for the import of coal before 1993. After 1993, NCL has become inactive and 
private enterprises came into existence for the import of coal. These enterprises make 
their own agreement with Coal India Limited or other suppliers abroad and supply coal to 
the market. These enterprises are entitled to fix their own prices for the coal. 
There are some small occurrence of coal and lignite in Nepal, which are not 
commercially attractive. The occurrences of coal can be classified in to four major 
categories: 
; Quaternary lignite of Kathmandu Valley 
; Coal from Dang (Eocene coal from Mid-Western Nepal) 
; Siwalik coal 
; Gondwana coal 
Out of these four types identified, the Quaternary lignite deposit of the Kathmandu Valley 
and coal from Mid-Western Nepal are of some economic significance. The Siwalik coal 
deposits, though widely distributed throughout the Siwalik range of the country, are small 
and sporadic and have not been commercially exploited. Likewise the Gondwana coal 
from the east of Nepal is of low quality, small in size and of no economic significance. 
Table 2.49 gives the primary production of coal and import statistics in Nepal.

In the year 2008/09, Nepal imported about 293 thousand tonnes of coal from India. 
Kathmandu alone consumes about 40% of imported coal. It is mainly used in the 
industrial sector like cement, lime, and brick industries in Nepal. Primary production of 
coal resources within the country is about 5% of the total coal import of the year 2008/09. 
There are some open pit mining practices in the Dang area for the extraction of lignitic 
coal. The primary production of this coal is about ten thousand tonnes, which are mainly 
used in brick manufacturing industries. Also Nepal imports from India through private 
organizations under agreement with Coal India Limited. 1.1.3 Renewable Energy Resources 
1.1.3.1 Solar Energy Resources 
Nepal, being located in favourable latitude, receives ample solar radiation. The average 
solar radiation varies from 3.6–6.2 kWh/m2/day, and the sun shines for about 300 days a 
year. The development of solar energy technology is thus reasonably favourable in many 
parts of the country. Average daily insolation in Nepal in kWh/m2 is given in the Table in 
annex 2. These figures also emphasize high solar energy potential and possibilities of 
development of solar energy technology. As per the recently published report of AEPC, 
2008 under Solar & Wind Energy Resource Assessment in Nepal (SWERA), the 
commercial potential of solar power for grid connection is 2,100 MW. 
With national average sunshine hours of 6.8/day and solar insolation intensity of about 
4.7 kWh/m2/day, there is a huge potential for solar thermal devices such as Solar Water 
Heaters (SWH), Solar Dryers (SD), Solar Cookers (SC). Presently SWH have been fully 
commercialized and till 2009 more than 185,000 SWH have been installed in the country. 
SD and SC are still in the phase of dissemination and commercialization. This shows 
quite significant improvement in SWH installations in recent years. 
Solar Electricity Generation 
For a large part of the rural population consuming low electrical energy, there is no viable 
alternative to solar electricity for rural electrification. The operation and maintenance cost 
of diesel generators is too high, biogas technology does not work satisfactorily on the 
fairly cold high altitudes or in the mountains and would be difficult to achieve with roving 
herds of cattle. Small Hydro turbines need specific topographical conditions that are only 
found near a small percentage of users’ dwellings. Solar electricity generating systems, 
which do not need fuel or extensive infrastructure, are easy and quick to install. This 
could be very viable option in many locations of the country. However, it cannot be 
claimed that solar electricity can solve rural electrification issues completely. Solar 
electricity too has limitations and problems but these can overcome with proper planning. 
Solar Electricity Potential 
The country has 300 sunny days per annum and thus is very rich in solar power 
potential. Using PV module of 12% efficiency, total energy generated will be 0.12* 4.5 * 
147,181*106
 = 80,000GWh/day = 17.7 TW (assuming peak sun to be 4.5 hours). This 
energy generated is more than energy required for fulfilling the whole energy demand of 
the world. The total estimated world energy demand at present is about 13 TW. If we use 
just 0.01% of the total area of Nepal, we can generate solar electricity of 8 GWh/day that 
is 2920 GWh/year (which is more than the energy generated by NEA in the year 2003 
amounting 2261 GWh/year). 
Major Users of Solar Electricity in Nepal 
Information on first officially recorded use of solar electricity in Nepal was not available. It 
is said that the Nepal Telecommunications Corporation (NTC) was the first organization 
to use solar electricity to power a high frequency communication transceiver located in 
Damauli in 1974. Since then NTC has become one of the significant users of solar 
electricity amounting to more than 1000 kWp generating about 47000 kWh/day of 
electrical energy at more than 3000 locations, without national grid supplied electricity. 
Seventy five percent of all the Public Call Offices (PCO) in NTC is being powered by PV. The estimated market potential is huge and about 5 MWp of photovoltaic power is 
currently being used in various public and private sectors (telecommunication, utility 
supply, stand-alone, water supply, aviation etc.) in Nepal are shown in Table 1.23.

Stand-alone Solar Home System (SHS) constitute above 5000 kWp with 185017 
numbers up to 2008/09. The installation of stand-alone SHS is shown in Figure 10. The 
trend of SHS installation shows a steep rise after 2000 due to the subsidy policy 
implemented by AEPC/ESAP. Till December 2004, 51 solar PV pumping systems have 
been installed, of which 28 were installed after 2000 with subsidy provided from AEPC.

Some INGOs are said to have installed solar pumps (3.2 kWp in Mustang) and solar PV 
driven mills (1.2 kWp and 1.6 kWp in Mustang) for grinding wheat and millet. 
1.1.3.2 Wind Energy Resources 
Wind is still unharnessed energy resource in Nepal. Due to its diverse topography and 
the consequent variation in the meteorological conditions, it is difficult to generalize wind 
conditions in the country. Specific areas have been identified as a favourable for viable 
wind energy generation. Studies made for the World Bank in 1977 indicate that in the 
Khumbu area, average wind speed obtainable for wind energy generation is over 5 m/s. 
The Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM) conducted a study in 1983 and 
recorded wind speed data for a number of stations. The conclusion drawn by DHM 
indicates that wind could be used for electricity generation in the hills and for irrigation 
and pumping of drinking water in the Terai. The study by DANGRID, a Danish consulting 
firm in 1992 reported that a potential to generate 200 MW of electrical power with an 
annual energy production of 500 GWh from the wind resources along the 12 km valley between Kagbeni and Chusang in Mustang District. WECS along with DHM, Alternative 
Energy Promotion Centre (AEPC) and Nepal Academy of Science and Technology 
(NAST) carried out study on the Potential of Wind Resources in Nepal in the year 1999-
2002. This study shows that there is not high potentiality of wind energy except for some 
high mountainous locations i.e. Thakmarpha, Khumbu and Khanjiroba. 
Report of AEPC, 2008 under Solar & Wind Energy Resource Assessment in Nepal 
(SWERA), revealed that the commercial potential of wind power is 3,000 MW. A pilot 
project for demonstrations and dissemination is being carried out by various 
organizations like AEPC, ITDG etc. ITDG has installed five 200-watt wind turbines at 
various locations on Kavre, Tansen Palpa, Makawanpur, Chisapani (Karnali), and 
Udayapur for the stand-alone system whereas AEPC has installed one 400-watt wind 
turbine at Nagarkot for demonstration purposes. In connection to geothermal energy 
resources, 32 hot water spring sites are situated at various parts of the country, with a 
water temperature up to 50° Centigrade (CES, 2000). They are used for the therapeutic 
purposes and a study is needed to investigate the possible end uses of the hot water 
spring resources. 
1.1.3.3 Biogas Resource Potential 
Biogas-a modern form of energy derived from anaerobic digestion of animal waste 
mainly cattle dung, and recently also human excreta mixed with cattle dung in some 
areas, has been the alternative source of energy for cooking and sometimes for lighting 
in rural households, mostly in the Terai and some low lying villages in the mid-hill 
districts of Nepal. 
The Biogas Support Programme (BSP) under the Alternative Energy Promotion Centre 
and with the cooperation from various donors such as SNV and KfW is promoting the 
installation of biogas plant in various part of the country. There are more than 2,00,000 
biogas plants installed in various districts of Nepal. Also there are about 60 private 
biogas companies and 15 biogas appliances manufacturing workshops in the country for 
the effective dissemination of this technology. Also biogas program is developed as the 
first CDM project in Nepal. 
BSP-Nepal (2005) present the biogas production potential based upon the number of 
cattle/buffalo in the country in 1997/98 (Table 1.25). Their estimate takes into account 
the quantity of dung that could be available for biogas and the micro-climatic pockets 
where biogas production could be technically feasible in different parts of the country.

Considering only 75 percent of the potential could be realized due to other uses of dung, 
the above data indicate a potential of 2.9 million biogas plants in Nepal (smallest size 
biogas plant capacity 4m3
). The above assessment does not take into account the 
droppings of poultry and the excreta of pigs and goats, nor that of human beings. If all these were added then the biogas production potential could be greatly enhanced in the 
country. 
Different studies have tried to assess the biogas potential in the country. In 1992, Wim J. 
van Nes es (in BSP-Nepal, 2005) calculated the potential of establishing 1.3 million 
plants. CMS and SNV/BSP (in BSP-Nepal, 2005) assume a technical potential ranging 
between 1.3-2.9 million plants, the economic potential was considered only to be 60,000 
plants. This estimate takes into account the quantity of dung that could be available for 
biogas and the micro-climatic pockets where biogas production could be technically 
feasible in different parts of the country.

Total biogas production potential in the year 2008/09 is about 43 million GJ which is 
about 11% of the total energy demand of the same year. Table 1.27 provides the 
information on potential of biogas availability in 2008/09. Potential of biogas availability in 
the country is about 81% of the total biogas production. The availability factor of the 
biogas production in the Terai, Hills and Mountain region is 100%, 75% and 50% 
respectively.

The estimated total technical potential of biogas plants is about 1.9 million plants of 
which 1,000,000 plants are thought to be economically viable. As of December 2008/09, 
more than 200000 biogas plants of varying capacities (4681015 and 20 m3
) have been installed (BSP, 2010). The trend observed during the period of 1998-2004 shows 
an increase, mainly because of the technical and financial support from BSP/SNV. The 
yearly installation and trend are shown in Table 1.29. It is also noteworthy to quote that 
more than 90% of these plants are operational.

Alternative Energy Promotion Centre and Biogas Support Programme have identified 
some of the most important socio-economic benefits of biogas plants as follows: 
 Reduction of the workload of mainly women and girls by about 3 
hours/day/household. The saved time is used for education, income generation 
activities and leisure. 
 Annual savings of: 
- Fuel wood used for cooking to the extent of 282,024 (@2 tons/plant) (at 
90%operability) 
- Agriculture waste to the extent of 49,354 tons (@0.35 ton/plant). 
- Dung cakes to the extent of 84,607 tons (@0.60 ton/plant). 
- Annual saving on kerosene of 3.5 million liters (@25 liters/plant). 
 Annual reduction of GHG emissions to the extent of 987,084 tons CO2 – 
equivalent (@7 tons/plant). 
 Annual production of 246,771 tons – dry weight (@1.75 tons/plant) bio slurry and 
bio compost 
 Proper usages bio-slurry and bio-compost in 125,344 (at 80% households). 
 Improved agriculture yields and reduced use of chemical fertilizer. 
 Improvement of rural sanitations by connecting 98,708 toilets in 70% plants 
 Reduction of indoor pollution due to kitchen smoke in 141,012 households. 
 Reduced incidence of illness and expenses on health. 
 Generation of direct and indirect employment. 
 Annual total thermal power output 443 MW (at 3.14 kW/plant/day at 90% 
operability).  550 MW electric power stations is needed to generate 443 MW thermal energy at 
80% electric stove efficiency. 
1.1.3.4 Micro-Hydro Resources 
The hydro power stations for generation of mechanical and electrical energy up to a 
capacity of 100 kW come under micro-hydro category. The installations of such units up 
to 1000 kW do not require any license from the Government. Till 2008/09, there were 
about 1977 micro-hydro (including pico-hydro) electrification schemes installed in various 
part of the country since 1962, with the total installed capacity of about 13.9 MW. In 
addition, there are about 6253 units (approx. 15.2 MW) for mechanical power generation 
for the milling purpose. Realizing the significant potential of micro-hydro, Government of 
Nepal is promoting its development by providing subsidies for the installation of microhydro plant according to the location and remoteness of the districts. Table 1.30 provided 
the some data on micro-hydro.

1.1.3.5 Other Biomass Waste Production Potential 
Solid waste 
The other biomass waste having energy potential include municipal solid waste, forest 
and agro-industrial wastes. ADB/ICIMOD (2006) reported that there were 58 
municipalities of varying sizes in the country that generated over 1,350 tons of solid 
waste every day. Among them, the Kathmandu Municipality was the largest one and 
produced 383 tons of solid waste on a daily basis, which was slightly less than one-third 
of the total municipal waste generated in the country. In the Municipal solid waste, the 
household waste comprised of about 75 percent. The per capita solid waste production 
per day varied from 0.11 to 0.93 kg (average 0.34 kg). 
The households on the outskirts of smaller towns are rural in nature and used most of 
the waste for feeding domestic animals. This report cited SWMRMC (2004) for 
presenting the composition of solid wastes generated in the municipal areas, which 
comprised of: 
 Organic material 66 percent by weight (with a range of about 39 to 95 percent 
from municipality to municipality);  Metal, glass paper, and plastic combined, 20 percent by weight (range 5 to 50 
percent), plastic alone constitutes 7.6 percent (range 1.6 to 21 percent); 
 Inert material 9.6 percent (range 0 to 37 percent); and 
 "Other" (including medical waste) about 5 percent. 
Another source (ICIMOD/MoEST/UNEP, 2007) stated that, "Solid waste generation rates 
vary depending upon living standards, livelihood practices, and consumption patterns." It 
was also of the view that the waste generation rate has changed over the years in the 
urban areas, and the current estimation of municipal solid waste generation in five 
municipalities of the Kathmandu Valley was provided as shown below in Table 1.31. 
Table 31: Waste Generation in Five Municipalities (tons/day) 
Municipality Generation in 2004 Collection in 2004 Projected generation 2015
Kathmandu 308.4 250 547.9
Lalitpur 75.1 52 135.4
Bhaktapur 25.5 19 46.2
Madhyapur Thimi 14.3 5 27.8
Kirtipur 11.6 4 18.1
Total 434.9 330 775.4
 Source: Nippon Koei 2005 (in ICIMOD/MoWST/UNEP, 2007) 
From the above table, it can be observed that five municipalities generated daily about 
435 tonne of solid waste, of which more than 70 percent was from the Kathmandu 
municipality. Currently, management of these wastes is a challenge to these 
municipalities, which requires land, human and financial resources. 
In the above table, most of the contents in the municipal solid wastes belonged to the 
classification of biodegradable organic waste, which comprised of energy potentials but 
the estimated energy generation potentials of these sources is yet to be determined. The 
non-biodegradable wastes generated in municipal areas have already been included 
under the municipal solid wastes in ADB/ICIMOD (2006). 
The data concerning biodegradable wastes generation outside of these studied areas 
was not available for consideration of its energy potential. Besides the traditional forest 
and agro-based industries such as saw mills, rice and wheat mills etc, other industries 
also generate significant amount of biodegradable organic wastes in different shape and 
forms, i.e. molasses in sugar mills, black liquor in paper mills, etc. However, the 
cumulative biomass waste production data by industry type was not available, which, 
limited the assessment of the bio-energy potential. 
Secondary Sources of Wood-fuel 
Secondary sources of wood-fuels are residues from logging and wood processing 
industries, but also recycled wood from construction activities, packing crates, pallets, 
driftwood, furniture, etc. 
 Logging residues 
Recovery rates vary considerably depending on local conditions. A 50/50 ratio is often 
found in the literature e.g. for every cubic meter of log removed, a cubic meter of waste 
remains in the forest (including the less commercial species). The logging residue 
consists of stump, branches, leaves, defect logs, off-cuts and sawdust. However 
recovery rate has been found up to 66 % in some logging areas. In some cases the residues are converted into charcoal. In order to calculate the amount of logging 
residues an average recovery factor of 60% has been used. 
 Saw-milling 
Recovery rates vary with local practices as well as species. However, for calculation 
purposes, a residue recovery factor (yield factor) of 50% has been used (38% solid wood 
waste such as bark, slabs, edgings, trimmings etc. and 12% sawdust). 
 Plywood production 
Plywood making is a large-scale operation and involves the cutting of the logs to the 
length required and de-barking the logs. Residue recovery rates in plywood production 
vary from 45 to 50% with the main variable being the diameter and quality of the log. For 
calculation purposes a yield factor of 50% has been used, with 45% solid wood residues 
and 5% in the form of dust. 
 Particle board production 
Particleboard production basically involves size reduction of the wood, drying, screening, 
mixing with resins and additives, forming of the mat, pressing and finishing. All types of 
wood are used for the production of particle board such as solid wood, solid wood 
residues (off cuts, trimmings), low grade waste such as hogged saw mill waste, sawdust 
and planer shavings, etc. For calculation purposes a residue factor of 10% has been 
taken, consisting of screening fines and dust while 17% of the residues are assumed to 
be recycled. 
Perennial Plantation Crop Residue 
Coconut 
Coconut trees generate residues in the form of wood, fronds, husks and shells. About 12 
to 14 fronds are shed per tree per year, yielding about 1.5 kg of dry woody biomass per 
frond or, assuming a density of 120 trees per ha., about 2,400 kg. per ha. Based on a 
literature survey, an residue to product (RPR) value of 0.419 for husks with a moisture 
content of 10.3% (based on actual measurements) while for shells an RPR value of 0.12 
with a moisture content of 8.7% are used. 
Others 
Besides the plantation crops mentioned above, there are other sources of residues in the 
crop plantation industry, e.g. tea (pruning every 7-10 years of tea bushes and uprooting 
after productive life) and coffee (pruning of shade trees and uprooting). However, very 
little information is available and these have therefore not been considered. 
Energy Consumption Scenario 
1.1.4 Energy Consumption by Fuel-types 
Figure 1.12 shows the distribution of energy consumption by various fuel-types in 
2008/09. The overall energy consumption of Nepal is largely dominated by the use of 
traditional non commercial forms of energy such as fuel-wood, agricultural residues and animal waste. The share of traditional biomass resources, commercial energy resources 
and renewable energy resources are 87%, 12% and 1% respectively. The share of 
traditional fuel decreased from 91% in 1995/96, 88% in 2004/05 and 87% in 2008/09. 
The remaining 13% of energy consumed is through commercial source (Petroleum fuels, 
Coal and Electricity) and Renewable. There is a slow pace of energy shift from traditional 
to modern one. The share of commercial has increased from about 9% in 1995 to about 
12% in 2008/09. Similarly there is a growing trend in the alternative energy. Within the 
commercial source, electricity is in the higher side in substituting other fuels. Fuel-wood 
is the largest energy resources in Nepal providing about 77% of the total energy demand 
in the year 2008/09. Other sources of biomasses are agricultural residues and animal 
dung, which contribute about 4% and 6% respectively. Share of petroleum fuels in the 
total energy system is about 8%. Other sources of commercial energy are coal and 
electricity both of which contributes about 4% in the total energy supply. The total 
consumption is about 9% higher than the year of 2004/05 with an average growth of 
2.4% annually.

Total Consumption
401 Million GJ
Source: WECS, 2010 
1.1.4.1 Traditional Fuel Consumption by Sectors 
Fuel-wood consumption was about 311 million GJ which is 77% of the total energy 
demand of the country in 2008/09. Average annual growth of fuel-wood consumption is 
around 2.5%. More than 99% of the total fuel-wood is consumed only in the residential 
sector. Other fuel-wood consuming sectors are industrial and commercial. These sectors 
use fuel-wood especially for heating, boiling and mixing with the coal. 
Agricultural residue is the third largest fuel-types providing energy, especially in 
residential and industrial sectors. Total agricultural residue consumption in the year 
2008/09 was about 14.6 million GJ which is about 4% of the total energy demand of the 
same year. Generally such residues are used for igniting the wood fuels while mixing with the wood fuel resources. About 10% of the total residues are consumed in industrial 
sector for heating and boiling purposes. Rice husk is one of the major fuels in many 
industries that require heat for its operation. Agri- residue consumption is growing by 
about 1.9% annually. 
Animal dung is consumed only in the residential sector so far. However, its contribution 
is very high in the total energy system because it supplies about 6% of the total energy 
demand annually. Animal dung is widely used in the Terai region of the country where 
forest resources are not easily available. Animal dung is being used in both form that are 
dry cake and gaseous. This fuel is the poorest form of energy while looking from energy 
ladder perspective. Growth of animal dung is around 2.3% annually. However, use of 
animal dung in biogas generation is increasing by about 15% in annual basis. 
1.1.4.2 Commercial Fuel Consumption by Sectors 
Coal is one of the important energy resources for Nepal because it provides more than 
half?? of the total energy requirement of the industrial sector. This resource provides 
heating and boiling services in the industries. Minimal amount is used in residential and 
commercial sector also. In earlier years, it was also used for railway transport in 
Janakpur-Jaynagar corridor. 
With the increasing growth rate of customers availing electricity services of NEA, the 
power and energy demand is also increasing accordingly. In 2007/08, the numbers of 
customers grew by 9.07% as compared to that of previous year. Accordingly, the power 
and energy demand also grew by 11.31% and 10.76% respectively in that year. This 
growth is more significant in residential and industrial sector compared to other 
development sectors (NEA, 2009). 
Electricity in the residential sector is mainly used for lighting. However, depending upon 
the degree of urbanization, it is also increasingly used for running domestic appliances. 
They include from the most basic electrical/electronic appliances such as cooking 
ranges, audio-visuals, computers, refrigerators, air conditioners etc. Approximately 1.0% 
of total residential energy consumption was met by electricity in 2008/09. Electricity 
provides about one-fourth (23%) of the industrial energy requirement. The contribution of 
electricity in transport sectors is minimum about 0.1% only. It is used mainly to run cable 
cars, ropeways and trolley buses, which are very few. The share of electricity 
consumption in commercial sector is only about 11%. The main uses of electricity in 
commercial sector, is similar to those in residential sectors, e.g. cooking, heating, 
lighting, water pumping and running other electrical appliances. About 5% of the energy 
requirement in agriculture sector comes through grid electricity. Electricity, in this sector, 
is used mainly for lift irrigation. 
Petroleum is the second largest energy fuel after fuelwood, supplying about 8% (about 
33 million GJ) of the total energy demand of the national economy. This fuel has 
significant role in economic development processes. Because, three major economic 
productive sectors namely transport, commercial and Industrial output is mostly depend 
on this fuel resources. About 63% of the total petroleum is consumed in the transport sector followed by residential sector (16.6%), agriculture sector (10.5%), commercial 
sector (8.2%) and industrial sector (1.4%). 
1.1.5 Sectoral Energy Consumption 
The energy consuming sectors are classified as residential, commercial, transport, 
industrial and agriculture sector. For energy accounting, energy consuming entity which 
does not fall in the above five sectors such as, street light, temples, church and 
mosques, etc, are categorised as others. The total energy consumption in the year 
2008/09 was 401 million GJ. The sectoral energy consumption has changed marginally 
compared to the previous years. Figure 5.7 shows the different share of energy 
consumption by various sectors in 2008/09. The figure shows that the residential 
accounts for the major share of energy consumption (89.1%), followed by transport 
(5.2%), industry (3.3%), commercial (1.3%) and then the agricultural and others. 
1.1.5.1 Residential Sector Energy Consumption 
The residential sector used about 356.7 million GJ (89.1%) in 2008/09. Biomass 
resources are the major fuels used in this sector, namely fuel-wood, agricultural residue 
and the animal waste. Recently, renewable sources like biogas and electricity from 
micro-hydro and solar home systems are substituting conventional fuels used mainly for 
cooking and lighting. The commercial sources of fuel used are nominal and is mainly 
used in the urban centers. Fuel-wood supply 86% of the total energy requirement 
followed by animal dung, agri-residue and petroleum. Share of alternative energy 
resources is still less than 1%. Residential sector is broadly divided into two categories 
namely the rural residential and urban residential. WECS (2006) has assessed that the 
energy consumption in urban residential sector was 47.7 million GJ, which is about 
14.5% of the total residential energy consumption. Urban sector energy consumption 
pattern is different than the rural residential. About 52% of the urban energy is used for 
cooking purpose followed by electric appliance (14%), Lighting (13%), heating and 
cooling (10%), animal feeding (8%) and agricultural processing (3%). 
It has been observed that the LPG is substituting as a cooking fuel in the urban centres 
as the consumption growth rate of about 23% per annum for the last few years followed 
by electricity with 10%. Though the consumption of renewable is nominal in quantitative 
terms, the annual growth rate of solar is quite high with more than 200% followed by 
biogas and electricity from micro-hydro with 15% and 32% respectively. Decreasing 
trend is observed in the use of kerosene in the residential sector. The overall growth rate 
of energy consumption in the residential sector is about 2.3 % per annum. 
1.1.5.2 Industrial Sector Energy Consumption 
Total Energy consumption in the industrial sector is about 13.4 million GJ (2008/09) 
which is about 3.3% of the total energy demand. The energy consumption has been 
increasing marginally during the last few years. The industrial energy consumption has 
increased only by about 0.4% annually since last eight years. The main end uses in the 
industrial sector are process heating, motive power, boiling in the boilers and lighting. 
WECS (1998) has assessed the industrial sector energy consumption pattern both in traditional and modern sector. Industrial energy consumption was 9.1 million GJ for the 
year 1996/97. Industrial sector is broadly categorized into two types; modern and 
traditional. Modern industries are also grouped into large industry and medium industry. 
The share of energy consumption in large modern industry is about 78%, followed by 
medium industry (17%) and traditional industry (5%). Industrial energy consumption by 
physiographic region shows wide variation. 63% of the total energy is consumed in Terai 
region, whereas 29% in Hills and only 8% is consumed in Mountain region. Regarding 
end use, Boiler dominated other type of end use. Other end uses of the sectors are 
power motive (31%), process heating (30%) and lighting (2%). 
1.1.5.3 Transport Sector Energy Consumption 
Transport is the second largest energy consuming sector only after the domestic sector. 
Energy consumption in this sector is about 20.8 million GJ (5.2%) in the year 2008/09. 
The total energy consumption in the transport sector is in increasing trend. It is observed 
that for the past few years the energy consumption growth rate in this sector is about 8.9 
% annually. It is found that High Speed Diesel takes the highest share with 67% followed 
by Motor Spirit with about 20% and then Air Turbine Fuel with 12%. The contribution of 
LPG is also increasing. LPG provides about 1% energy requirement of this sector. 
Electricity consumption in this sector is very minimal. There is some shift in the energy 
consumption pattern in transport sector is observed as compared to the year 1999/2000, 
in which, 78.8% High Speed Diesel followed by ATF (13.4%), Motor Spirit (11.4%), LPG 
(0.3%) and Grid electricity (0.2%) is used (WECS,2000). 
1.1.5.4 Commercial Sector Energy Consumption 
Energy consumption in the commercial sector is observed to be increasing at an annual 
rate of 3% since 2000/01. This sector includes large number of other sub sectors namely 
the Academic (school, college, university), Health (health post, hospitals), Institutions 
(Private and Publics), Retail shops (essential, non essential), Hotels (Star hotels, Non 
star hotels, Restaurant, Cinema/Hi-vision halls, Water supply, Military and Police barrack 
and Others (Public lighting, Religious place etc). Total energy consumed was about 5.2 
million GJ in 2008/09. The main fuels used in the commercial sector are petroleum (LPG 
and Kerosene), fuel-wood, and electricity. The main end-uses of the commercial sector 
are quite similar to that of residential sector such as cooking, heating, lighting, boiling, 
cooling, water pumping and electric/electronic appliances etc. The largest contribution 
comes from petroleum specially the LPG and Kerosene providing about 53% of the 
sector demand. Fuel-wood supplies about 36% of the sectoral energy consumption. 
Electricity is the third largest sources of energy (11%). For the last few years, it has been 
seen that the LPG consumption growth rate is about 22%, while consumption rate of 
kerosene is in decreasing trend of 9% per annum. Fuel-wood and electricity consumption 
is increasing by about 2.1% and 9% per annum respectively. Cooking is the largest end 
use in this sector consuming about 68.4% of the total followed by lighting (19.3%), 
boiling water (0.3%), space heating and cooling (5.3%) and other electrical services such 
as water pumping etc.( 6.7%) . 1.1.5.5 Agricultural Sector Energy Consumption 
Agricultural sector uses only two types of energy sources that are electricity and 
petroleum. In the year 2008/09, agricultural sector consumed about 1% of the total 
national energy demand (3.6 Million GJ). About 95% of the total agricultural energy 
comes from petroleum products specially the diesel fuel. Only 5% is derived from 
electricity. Electricity consumption in this sector is increasing at higher rate compared to 
the petroleum. It is increasing by about 8% annually since 2000/01 whereas light diesel 
oil is increasing by about 11% annually. Average rate of change in high speed diesel 
consumption is around 1%. 
Current Energy System Analysis 
1.1.6 Dwindling traditional sources of energy 
Forest coverage in the country has declined from 29% in 1999 to 25 percent in 2005 
(FAO, 2005). Fuel-wood extraction may not be the only cause of deforestation but 
deforestation is also taking place due to immigration and resettlement. With fuel-wood 
crisis, the consumption of agricultural residues for energy purposes has also increased 
resulting in falling production, encroachment of marginal land for farming, exposure to 
the risks of soil erosion and further degradation in crop productivity and biomass supply. 
1.1.7 Increasing imports of petroleum products 
The contribution of petroleum product and coal for the total energy supply is about 10%. 
However, the expense incurred to import these fuels is significant. In 2008, about 52 
billion rupees has been spent for different kinds of fuel (MoE, 2009). Out of this amount 
more than 33 billion rupees had been spent just to import the petroleum fuel and 0.8 
billion for the coal. Petroleum import was 34 percent of the merchandise exports in 
2000/01 (MoF, 2007). The merchandise export of the country stands at Rs 38 billion in 
first 8 months of 2007/08 (MoF,2009). The country had spend 57 percent of it for 
importing petroleum products for this period. Due to the increase in the international 
prices of the petroleum products and the country’s growing dependence on it, much of 
the export earnings are being used for importing and it is in the increasing trend. This 
dependence is precarious for the country’s economy. 
Figure 12: Petroleum Products Import against Commodity Export of Nepal 
 Source: MoF, 2009 The price of petroleum products in the world market is steadily rising, with some 
exceptional years. This rising of price has become inexorable since 2003. It was around 
US$22 in that year and reached to around US$ 150 a barrel in August 2008 which has 
eased down to US$ 50/barrel in November 2008. The repercussion of this phenomenon 
had been clearly reflected in the price of petrol and diesel in Nepal too. It can be seen in 
figure 1.14 from the annual average price of these fuels in the last 15 years. 
Figure 13: Annual average prices of diesel and petrol 
Source: NOC, 2010 
Energy analysts forecasted that prices of the crude oil will continue to rise in the coming 
years in the international petroleum markets (IEA, 2010) as shown in 1.15. Indeed, 
many developing, mostly least developed and mostly oil vulnerable countries are likely to 
suffer even more due to rising prices. 
Figure 14: Forecasted prices of crude oil in the international market 
Source: IEA, 2010 
Nepal is totally dependent for imports of petroleum products for its energy requirement. 
In the period of 1995 to 2000, the oil import in Nepal is increased by 15.34 percent (UN, 
2007). The demand of petroleum products are ever increasing, the import percentage 
will also increase in the years to come. 1.1.8 Some current facts on energy economics 
Table 1.32 compares the market price, efficiency and effective price of the major fuel 
types used for cooking purpose in Nepal. The effective price of the LPG is slightly less 
than other fuels in terms of a single Giga Joule energy. Fuel-wood only becomes 
cheapest once it is available free of cost or less than NRs. 5 per kilogram. Efficiency of 
the fuel using devices is very important factors to decide the effective price of fuels. 
Because of the lower efficiency of fuel-wood using devices, its effective price is higher 
than other fuel-types such as LPG, electricity and kerosene. Second highest effective 
price of the cooking fuel is kerosene (Rs.2652/GJ) followed by Electricity (Rs. 2604/GJ) 
and LPG (Rs. 2395/GJ).

Source: WECS estimate (2010) 
About 18 million tons of fuel wood is consumed annually in Nepal, out of which less than 
1% is commercialized. Rest is collected by the users free of cost from forests or their 
own cultivated land. 
Calculating the annualized life cycle cost (ALCC) of using kerosene, LPG cooking 
stoves, and electrical cooking appliance for an average family of five persons, the 
increasing price in the petroleum products have completely changed the scenario of the 
fuel economics. 
Table 33: Monthly Life Cycle Costs of Cooking for an Average Nepali Family (NRs) 
Year Kerosene LPG Electricity
1997 180 465 605
2000 385 405 680
2003 410 510 788
2009* 912 794 788
(Based on the calculation and International Energy Initiative, 2004 and NOC, 2009) 
In 1997, the monthly life cycle cost for cooking was Rs 180 for kerosene, Rs 465 for 
LPG, and Rs 605 for electricity. After the price revision in March 2009, the monthly ALCC 
turned up to be Rs 912 for kerosene, Rs 794 for LPG, and Rs 788 for electricity 
respectively. With the new price revision of petroleum prices, it has become evident that 
Nepal has to immediately substitute petroleum products by electricity for cooking in the 
residential, service, and other sectors. If the crude prices go up to US dollar 150 per barrel in future, the monthly ALCC for petroleum products will be exorbitantly higher 
compared to that of electricity. Hence, in order to enhance the country’s supply security, 
it is very imperative to emphasize on development of indigenous energy resources. 
Besides, it is urgent to create awareness program for consumers’ switching from 
petroleum products to electricity especially in the urban areas where grid electricity is 
available. In the rural sector, it may not be possible immediately for switching to 
electricity because of the income disparity and the topographic terrains of the country. 
For rural areas, to reduce health hazards, the people should be encouraged to switch 
from traditional biomass energy sources to modern biomass such as biogas. They 
should also be encouraged to switch to energy sources such as kerosene, LPG from 
traditional biomass sources in the energy ladder. Finally, the ultimate objective should be 
to switch over to electricity in the long run. 
1.1.9 Dismal situation of electricity supply 
Nepal’s installed electricity generating capacity is 689.3 MW, of which around 90 percent 
is of hydropower generation and the rest is of thermal generation. The hydropower 
supply capability in Nepal varies from month to month due to the dependence on run-ofriver systems. This supply structure is in contrast to the demand structure. The electricity 
demand reaches peak in winter, when the generating capability of run-of-river plant is at 
the minimum level. On the contrary, the generation capacity is up to the mark in summer 
when demand is less compared to winter. As the production of electricity is not able to 
meet the demand, consumers are unable to switch over to electricity from petroleum 
products such as kerosene and LPG and compelled to pay the rising oil prices. 
1.1.10 Problems in energy sustainability and security 
The uncertainties about the stability and security of the petroleum products within the 
global energy market makes difficult to the country like Nepal on energy security. Nepal 
requires a stable, low-cost, and secure supply of energy. However, it is difficult to arrive 
at precise estimates of the exact economic cost of providing and unsatisfactory as well 
as unreliable supply of energy. Table 1.16 provides the sensitivity analysis of ration of 
imports of petroleum products to commodity exports. 
Based on the projection till 2015 as shown in the Figure 1.16, if Nepal’s export earnings 
were projected increasing with the average annual growth rate of 11 percent (the 
average growth rate of goods exports from 1995 to 2005), then the country will be 
requiring 59 percent of export earnings for importing petroleum products in 2015 at 
US$50 per barrel. But if the oil price goes at around US$150 a barrel, then Nepal may 
not be able to sustain the oil imports with its exports earnings only. The country may 
need almost twice the exports earning for importing just petroleum products. That means 
Nepal will be needing arrangement of funding from other sources for import of petroleum 
products. Figure 15: Analysis of Percentage of Petroleum Imports to Goods Exports in 2015

If a sensitivity analysis is conducted for import of petroleum products against export 
earnings of Nepal at different levels of oil prices in the international market, the picture 
seems precarious. 
1.1.11 Some options for energy security and sustainability 
According to a recent report on oil vulnerability of the Asian and the Pacific countries 
(UN, 2007), in-between 2002 and 2005, a sample of five hundred households 
interviewed in China, India, Indonesia and Laos People Democratic Republic, suffered 
from some dramatic price increases, paying as much as 74 percent more for their energy 
needs. This includes 171 percent more for cooking fuels, 120 percent more for 
transportation, 67 percent more for electricity, and 55 percent more for lighting fuels. 
National vulnerability to oil price increases depends not just on oil intensity, but also on 
how the economy of the country is resilient. An Oil Price Vulnerability Index (OPVI) was 
developed for 24 Asian and the Pacific countries based on the macroeconomic 
indicators, the economic and energy variables (UN, 2007). Countries are grouped based 
on their OPVIs: 
Low vulnerable countries (Low OPVI) - China, Iran and Malaysia 
Medium vulnerable countries (Medium OPVI) - Bhutan, India, Indonesia 
High vulnerable countries (High OPVI) - Nepal, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, 
 Cambodia, Sri-lanka, Pakistan 
Nepal, being in the high vulnerable group of countries, because of its poor economic 
performance compared to other South Asian Countries and its total dependence on 
imports of oil products, requires strategic options for its energy security and 
sustainability. Current Energy Policies 
Current energy sector policies are scattered in various documents and executive orders. 
These include policy statements of the government stated in periodic development plans, 
sub-sector policies, government orders and notices, and laws passed by the legislature. 
1.1.12 Periodic Development Plans 
The Fifth Plan (1975-1980) document of the government was the first sector specific 
policy statement in the energy sector. In the Plan, the government emphasized the need 
to reduce heavy dependence on traditional source of biomass and imported oil, and 
increase the supply of renewable energy sources including hydropower to meet the 
increasing demand for energy. 
Different ministries are mandated for development and management of different 
subsectors (Hydropower, fossil fuels, renewable energy) within energy sector. Realizing 
the need to establish an appropriate agency at the national level to coordinate and guide 
the development of energy sector, Water and Energy Commission (WEC) was 
established. The mandate of WEC is “to formulate and coordinate programs for the 
development and conservation of water and energy resources”. 
1.1.13 Hydropower Development Policies 1992 and 2001, Water Resources Act 
1992, and Electricity Act 1992 
The objectives of the 1992 Policy were to supply electricity as per the demands in urban 
and rural areas and meet the energy needs required for industrial development in the 
country. The laws passed by the legislature the same year made provisions to put the 
policies into practice encouraging the private sector through various fiscal and other 
incentives for development of hydropower in the country. The 2001 Policy in particular 
made policy announcements to utilize the hydropower potential to meet the domestic 
demands of electricity through transparent procedures to attract foreign and domestic 
investment, develop hydropower as an alternative to biomass and thermal energy, create 
rural electrification fund, control unauthorized uses of electricity and leakages, cover 
risks likely to occur in hydropower projects, demand side management and energy 
conservation. 
1.1.14 Water Resources Strategy 2002 and National Water Plan 2005 
The water resources strategy was guided by the principle of integrated water resources 
management. The strategy recognized that water resources development needs to be 
more closely integrated with sustainable social and economic development. In the 
hydropower sector, the strategy seeks to develop sufficient capacity to meet domestic 
needs at affordable prices and export of electricity. While putting into effect the targets 
set in the Strategy, the National Water Plan has fixed a target of hydropower generation 
of 700 MW by 2007 to meet the projected domestic demand at base case scenario 
without export. Similarly, a target of generation of 2,100 MW by 2017 and 4,000 MW by 
2027 have been fixed to meet the projected domestic demand at base case scenario 
without export. 1.1.15 Nepal Electricity Regulatory Commission Bill 
Nepal Government has submitted a bill on electricity regulatory body to the parliament 
(Constituent Assembly) for facilitating electricity production, transmission, distribution, 
trading, and management in a transparent way. Its other objectives are to balance supply 
and demand, to set electricity tariff, to develop competition in the electricity market and to 
protect consumer rights. With the establishment of this regulatory body, electricity market 
is expected to develop in a competitive environment where stakeholders’ rights are 
protected and electricity is made accessible, affordable and acceptable. 
1.1.16 National Electricity Crisis Resolution Action Plan 2008 
The government brought out a 38-point Electricity Crisis Resolution Action Plan in Poush 
2065 (2009). The Action Plan provides for immediate, short-term and long-term 
programmes. The principal concessions under immediate programmes include 
determining a Power Purchase Agreement at flat rate for power plants up to 25 MW, 7 
years income tax holiday and waiver of the provision for doing Environmental Impact 
Assessment (EIA) for power projects expected to go for implementation by Chaitra 2068 
(2011). Such power projects will be required to do Initial Environmental Examination 
(IEE). It included plans to import more power from India, build 200 MW thermal power 
plant and encourage power generation through captive plants by subsidizing the 
additional cost involved in producing power from oil, and strengthen and add 
transmission capacity. It will also encourage solar and wind power generation through 
various concessions and facilities. Emphasis has been given to encouraging efficiency 
through the use of low energy consumption bulbs, initiate a system of energy audit, 
implement a code of conduct to save energy, and raise public awareness for demand 
management. The concession included 80 percent subsidy for micro hydropower below I 
MW capacity. 
Short-term measures under the plan included building additional transmission lines to 
import power from India, increase power production through efficient operation of current 
generation facilities, control technical loss and controlling theft of electricity through 
cooperation of political parties, the public and local administration. 
The long-term programmes are building high capacity transmission lines between India 
and Nepal and large multi-purpose projects. Adopt national integrated energy policy with 
short, medium and long-term energy development plan. It also includes financial 
restructuring of the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA). 
1.1.17 Task Force for Hydropower development 
Government of Nepal (GON) formed a task force in December 2008 to formulate programs for 
developing 10,000 MW in 10 years for addressing the energy crisis situation. The task force 
highlighted the importance of developing hydropower and provided the list of storage and run-off 
projects with time-line for development. The report also recommended for improvement in the 
institutional aspects. GoN has again come up with the plan of development of 25,000 MW in 20 years in the plans and 
programs of the Government in July 2009. The 20 year plan report has elaborated the suggestion 
provided by the 10 year development plan report.Task Force for Hydropower development

elaborated the suggestion provided by the 10 year development plan report. 
1.1.18 Local Self-Governance Act, 2055 (1998) 
The law related to local bodies (Village and District Development Committees and 
Municipalities) has empowered the local government to formulate, implement, distribute 
and maintain the mini and micro hydropower projects and other energy projects in their 
respective jurisdictions. The law requires the local bodies to prepare resource map as 
well as annual and periodic plans. It provides for a detailed institutional framework and 
mechanisms for formulation and coordination of plans including a structure for integration 
of the plans. The District Development Committee is required to form an Integrated Plan 
Formulation Committee under the chairmanship of the President of the DDC with 
representation of Parliamentarians representing the district, among others. 
1.1.19 Rural Energy Policy 2006 
The Rural Energy Policy 2006 has been conceptualized with a sector-wide approach. 
The Policy has been designed, in particular, with the following strategies: 
; Development of a coherent rural energy policy which adequately addresses the 
energy needs of the rural population; 
; Rural energy subsidy policy with clear objectives and criteria addressing target 
groups; 
; Development and enforcement of efficient and effective credit systems; 
; Incorporation of rural energy policies of ministries and institutions related to rural 
development; 
; Effective cross-sectoral and donor coordination of rural energy programs; 
; Adequate information campaigns and education programs; and 
; A broad stakeholder involvement to ensure the whole process of technology 
development to project identification, design and implementation. 
The policy specifically targets to install improved biomass technologies to meet cooking 
and other heating energy needs, micro hydro installation for rural electrification through 
off-grid power production and distribution that is capable to be grid-connected when grid 
is extended, solar home systems (10 peak watt and above) and white-led and 
photovoltaic based solar lights replacing kerosene lampsThe policy recognizes solar home system as a mainstream electrification option for many rural areas where grid and 
micro hydro is not an option for long time to come. 
1.1.20 Forest Sector policies and Forest Act, 1992 
The forestry sector policy has evolved through distinct phases of privatization (pre-1950), 
nationalization (1957) and community orientation (1970). From review of forest policies 
of the government as expressed in periodic plans, emphasis on protection in the initial 
days was replaced by a phase of scientific management of the resource. Later in the 
post-1970s, management of the resource was replaced by an approach of popular 
participation of the community. The Tenth Plan (2002-2007) emphasizes promotion of 
conservation and sustainable use of forest resources, development of forest productbased enterprises, adoption of participatory approaches and poverty reduction to be 
achieved by providing opportunities for income and employment for poor, women and 
disadvantaged people. 
The Master Plan for Forestry Sector implemented since 1988 aims to (i) meet the 
people’s basic needs for forestry products (fuel-wood, fodder, etc.) on a sustainable 
basis, and (ii) protect and manage forests through people’s participation. The Forest Act 
and Rules framed under the act are considered to be quite progressive instruments. 
These instruments have also laid down provisions related to private forestry. Programs 
like Leasehold Forestry, Hills Leasehold Forestry and Forage Development Project that 
help raise incomes of families in the hills below poverty line also aim to protect and 
conserve forests. These programs help towards managing forests for fuel-wood. The 
proposed Forestry Sector Policy, 2000 on the other hand is specific in addressing the 
problem of energy in the rural areas by focusing its emphasis on managing the sector for 
fuel-wood. The long-term objective of the 2000 Policy is specific in meeting the people’s 
basic needs for fuel-wood, timber, fodder, and other forestry products on a sustainable 
basis. The forestry resources will be managed and utilized in a manner which gives 
priority to the basic needs of the people such as fuel-wood for cooking, timber for 
housing, fodder for domestic animals, and medicinal plants for health. The strategies for 
production will be to promote commercial plantations especially in the Terai. 
1.1.21 Petroleum, Coal and Natural Gas Sub-sector Policy 
Nepal Oil Corporation, registered under the Company Act 2021, has the monopoly to sell 
and distribute petroleum products (POL) in the country. It purchases oil from the world 
market and arranges to receive POL products from the Indian Oil Corporation in 
exchange for the imported oil. Currently the arrangement is to import POL products from 
the Indian Oil on the basis of prevailing market price quoted on the 1st and 16th of each 
month. 
Government with a notification in the Nepal Gazette required the NOC to distribute petrol 
with 10 percent of ethanol from Magh 1, 2060 (January 15, 2004) and is yet to be 
implemented. 
The national requirement of coal is being met through import due to virtual non-existence 
of coal mines with economic significance. Limited amount of low grade coal is locally 
mined in certain areas of Nepal. Coals extracted are distributed locally for use generally in brick kilns. Under the Mines and Minerals Act, 2042, coal mines are licensed and 
registered for their operation. 
A limited amount of natural gas has been found in some pockets of Kathmandu Valley. 
Probable reserves identified so far needs further confirmation in order to be of any use 
for commercial exploitation. If the proven reserves can be used economically even for a 
limited number of years, it is worth exploring in view of total dependence on imported 
gas. However, the policy on natural gas is yet to be formulated. 
1.1.22 National Transport Policy 2001 
With the objective to develop a transport system that is sustainable, dependable, less 
expensive, safe, comfortable and self-reliant, the National Transport Policy 2001 was 
adopted by the government in 2001. Detailed policies to realize the above objective 
include, among others, developing a transport system with renewable sources such as 
electric and solar energy. It also emphasizes development of a transport system that is 
pollution free. The 2001 sectoral policy on transport system includes sections on rail 
transport, cable car and ropeways all with renewable energy sources. 
Current Institutional Situation 
The prevailing institutional arrangement in energy sector is broadly based upon nature 
and type of energy resource, legal basis of the energy organization and scale of energy 
generation. Accordingly, a number of institutions exist in the energy sector. They perform 
energy planning, development and implementation functions. Government bodies, state 
owned public utilities and private sector, local bodies and communities are involved in 
energy sub-sectors by resources – e.g. traditional, commercial and renewable. Six 
different ministries - Ministry of Energy (MoEn), Ministry of Forests and Soil Conservation 
(MoFSC), Ministry of Agriculture and Co-operatives (MoAC), Ministry of Commerce and 
Supplies (MoCS), Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology (MoEST), and 
Ministry of Industry (MoI) play different role in energy sub-sectors with several agencies 
attached with these ministries. 
National Planning Commission (NPC) is responsible for coordination and bringing 
together the sub-sectoral energy development targets into the periodic development 
plan. Further, Water and Energy Commission/Water and Energy Commission Secretariat 
(WECS), the government's advisory agency in water and energy sectors, is responsible 
to help prepare and facilitate implementation of necessary policy, plan and legislation 
pertaining to the development of water and energy, and establish coordination among 
national and sectoral policies on water and energy. 
The micro scale electricity and other alternate energies are planned, managed and 
facilitated by Alternative Energy Promotion Centre (AEPC) which comes under MoEST. 
In traditional and commercial energy sub-sectors, there is dominance of public 
monopolies (in forests resource generation/harvesting of Timber Corporation of 
Nepal/MoFSC; in procurement and marketing of petroleum products of Nepal Oil 
Corporation/MoCS; and in transmission and distribution of electricity of Nepal Electricity 
Authority/MoWR). Chapter 2: Energy Issues in Nepal 
Energy issues in Nepal are mainly concerned with technical, policy/legal, institutional, 
environmental and socio-economic aspects. Energy poverty is a major issue in Nepal 
considering the very low level of energy consumption. As energy plays an important role in 
economic development, energy consumption level has to be increased. The current strategy is 
therefore focused on reducing the energy poverty of the country by increasing energy access 
and affordability ensuring energy sustainability.

At present, energy sector is classified into traditional, commercial and renewable energy. This 
classification is not compatible with the international standard. There is a need for reclassification 
of existing energy sector. 
2.1.2 Energy Poverty 
Energy poverty is a major issue in Nepal considering the very low level of energy consumption. 
As energy plays an important role in socio-economic development, energy consumption level has 
to be increased. The current strategy is, therefore, focused on the reducing the energy poverty of 
the country by increasing energy access and affordability. This can be achieved by producing 
finer form of energy in a larger scale i.e. hydropower, as well as through improving and 
increasing the distribution system. 
2.1.3 Integrated Energy Planning 
Number of ministries and departments are involved in energy sector (see Chapter 3). Ministries 
and departments involved in planning and development operate under their sectoral/sub-sectoral 
regulation and for their own targets. It lacks co-ordination which slows down the development of 
energy sector and access to energy for all in an equitable manner. 
The system and process for integrated energy planning in the existing sub-sectoral energy 
planning processes is lacking at present. This has resulted in lack of an integrated energy 
planning practices, a right energy mix framework (giving strategic priority to potential indigenous 
resources) and a pricing system-appropriate enough for the whole energy sector on a nationwide basis. Besides, lack of integrated energy planning both at the central and local levels has 
also constrained the national ability to comprehend, envision, investigate and cash internal and 
external market benefits offered by opportunities such as carbon trading. An institution is, 
therefore needed to be specified as a lead agency that is responsible for integrated energy 
planning to put in place the system and processes and accordingly strengthen the capability 
accordingly. 
Specific Issues 
Major issues identified in each energy sub-sector viz. Traditional Energy, Commercial Sector and y 
2.1.4 Issues on Traditional Energy 
Superficial recognition and low priority 
The overwhelming contribution of traditional energy sources (solid biomass fuels) in total primary 
energy supply has only been superficially recognized in energy statistics of the country. This is 
because, the annual Economic Survey of MOF and other reports specific to the energy sector 
categorically points out that over two-third of total primary energy supply is contributed by 
traditional energy resources. But there is lack of proportional allocation of funds for all round 
development, including implementation of activities related to fuelwood supply in the forestry 
sector, compared to the allocations in the commercial energy and renewable energy sub-sectors. 
Therefore, the current allocation of development fund in the forestry sector, which has so far 
remained the largest contributor of primary energy (in the form of TE), faces the challenge of 
meeting the growing fuelwood demands (in absolute terms) from the rural households, 
commercial establishments and traditional industries. 
Lack of awareness 
Present TE applications are primitive, inefficient and unsustainable. Energy use in traditional 
forms is expected to phase out over time with improvement in the national economy. In order to 
promote the long term use of available/surplus indigenous biomass sources for energy, the 
country must be aware of the technological innovations needed in the TE sub-sector, including 
in-country R&D for identification of appropriate technology, for identification and introduction of 
technically proven and commercially viable imported technologies for the domestic, commercial 
and industrial sectors. Except biogas generation from animal dung (and also from human excreta 
mix in some places) for energy and the activities of ICS for reduction of fuel consumption 
(through combustion efficiency enhancement) as well as indoor smoke pollution, awareness 
about other forms of modern bioenergy applications is still limited. 
Declining/depleting forest resources and conflicting management objectives 
The existing forest resources in the country are declining/depleting year after year due to various 
reasons causing difficulties in meeting the rural energy needs for different end-uses. Besides, the 
management objectives of none of the managed forest today have been solely aligned for the 
purpose of ensuring sustainable supply of fuelwood in the country. 
TE resources and supply systems 
The country has not yet pursued any dedicated plantations of energy crops, either annual or 
perennial crops and grasses or trees solely for the purpose of sustainable biomass supply for 
energy, neither in the agriculture nor in the forestry sector. Land, which is currently under forest, 
agriculture and other land uses constitutes the present TE resources in the country, which means 
trees on forest, non-forest and other types of lands are the major TE resources. Currently most of the biomass fuels (i.e. fuelwood, dung and agricultural residues) are derived as 
residues and byproducts of trees, crops and animals, either at production site during harvesting 
or at processing sites as residues and by-products of agriculture, livestock and forest-based 
management/production systems. From the point of view of present TE supply in the domestic, 
commercial, industrial sectors all these management systems play a crucial role, but such 
systems would not be feasible for maintaining a sustained supply of biomass sources for the 
development of centralized bio-energy production. 
Lack of Information 
Information regarding current level of biomass residue and by-product production, uses and the 
surplus amount by types, from the forestry, livestock, agriculture, industry and municipal sectors 
is not yet available for assessing the modern bio-energy generation potentials of these sources in 
the country. 
Competing land use and food security 
Unregulated/unplanned development of energy crops/trees on productive agriculture and forest 
lands may lead to food insecurity, loss of biodiversity and soil and water erosion, due to 
deforestation in watersheds. 
Non-proportional distribution of TE resources 
The distribution of existing TE resources, particularly forest, is neither uniform in all 
physiographical regions, nor proportional to the present distribution of population in different 
parts of the country, which has caused difficulty in the sustainable supply of TE sources for 
different end uses in some regions. 
Lack of management/unsustainable harvest of TE resources 
Not all potential TE resources have been adequately identified or put under effective 
management. The present production system is unreliable in terms of sustained supply of 
specific amount of biomass for energy in the domestic, commercial and industrial sectors. The 
problem remains crucial in the forestry sector, as the major TE source in the country is fuelwood 
that is derived mostly from forests without due consideration of the sustainable production 
potentials of different types of forests in different physiographical zones. In most cases present 
fuelwood harvest exceeds the sustainable production of existing forests in the neighborhood due 
to lack of management and/or over exploitation. 
Lack of effort on expansion/management of TE resources 
There is lack of effort on establishment of dedicated fuelwood plantations in fuelwood deficit 
areas, as well as on allocation of part of existing forests solely for the purpose of management of 
TE production sources under scientific management systems. 
Limited awareness/knowledge of ICS 
Currently, ICS dissemination has been limited in number and confined to specific sites. Only , , 
Besides, awareness of the need for standardization of ICS for specific end-uses at different 
scales still remained limited/weak at the implementation level. 
Limited awareness of improved/modern bio-energy technology 
The present knowledge about biomass based energy applications remained limited only to 
biomass fuels based traditional energy applications in the domestic, commercial and industrial 
sectors. The knowledge about proven and commercially viable improved (modern) biomass 
energy technologies in foreign markets still remained unfamiliar/ unacknowledged. 
High cost of improved technology 
Technology for improved TE application is available in commercial markets but has remained out 
of reach for a majority of TE users in the domestic and commercial sectors, because of its high 
cost and/or due to low economic status of the current TE users. Even the TE using rural 
industries remained reluctant to introduction of improved technology because of the high 
investment cost needed for innovation. 
Lack/insufficient effort on the use of non-wood biomass for energy 
Current effort on the use of non-wood biomass for modern energy generation is confined only to 
dissemination of different sizes of biogas digesters in the domestic sector, primarily for the use of 
cattle dung (and in some places also with human excreta mix) for biogas generation for meeting 
the domestic energy needs of rural farming households that maintains a minimum number of 
cattle heads needed for generation of biogas through specific size of digester. Regarding other 
non-woody residues, the only visible effort was densification of rice husk in the form of briquettes 
for use as a commercial fuel. But its current market price is beyond the purchasing capacity of 
average Nepalese for use as an alternative energy source in the domestic sector. Besides, the 
currently available briquette size does not match the energy needs of the households needed for 
diverse end-uses. 
Inadequate information/consideration of the fuelwood dependency 
Current efforts on energy development prioritize rural electrification for lighting and access to 
energy supply for initiating energy based economic development entrepreneurships. These 
efforts would not be sufficient to relieve the energy supply problems of the rural population, nor 
for reducing drudgery and hardship of fuelwood collection and use of women and children. A 
thorough study of the prevailing area specific TE demand/supply patterns, by end-uses seemed 
lacking. Such studies could provide a clear picture of what was the situation and what strategy 
would be necessary to overcome the problem. Where fuelwood was in short supply rural 
households were forced to look for inferior biomass for alternative fuel to overcome their 
immediate energy supply problem. 
2.1.4.1 Policy Issues on Traditional Energy 
Lack of a clear policy on the use of biomass 
There is lack of a clear policy and law on the use of biomass as energy source. The pressure on jpgy 
dominate the energy scene of the country for many years to come. 
Access to community forest 
There is lack of access by non member community to community forests. Access by women, 
poor and Dalits are restricted. Limited members of the group still exercise power and influence 
over the resource. There is problem of inclusiveness in representation. There is issue of 
institutional development of user’s group. Reform is needed in this sector. 
Gap between policy and law 
Implementation of private and leasehold forestry policy is ineffective. Many policies suffer from 
weak implementation because of absence of timely reform in law. 
Research and Development 
There is less priority for research and development. There is virtual absence of a policy that 
promotes research on technology for use of kitchen wastes as a source of energy. 
Efficiency of use 
Not enough attention is given to efficiency in use of energy. Conservation of forest is closely 
related with efficiency in use of forest resources. By use of improved cook stoves, for example, a 
household can cut the consumption of sizable amount of fuelwood. Saving is conserving. Energy 
efficiency is equivalent to energy producing. Existing policy does not emphasize that 
improvement in efficiency is conservation. 
2.1.4.2 Institutional Issues on Traditional Energy 
Lack of a specified institution responsible for management of different components within 
traditional energy sub-sector 
Public agencies and industries in forestry, agriculture and livestock do not consider energy 
production as a priority task of management under their specific sector and for proper utilization 
of the biomass residues and by-products for energy purposes. There is a lack of a public agency 
which is responsible for managing different components of traditional energy sub-sector. 
Lack of operational recognition to and support for planning, monitoring and facilitation of 
energy resources development activities at the local level 
Central level sub-sectoral institutions are dominant. The devolved bottom-up system of 
development has very little space in this centralized mechanism. Lack of operational recognition 
to and support for local bodies to involve them in planning, monitoring and facilitation of energy 
resources development activities at the local level has affected the quality of program/project 
implementation in each energy sub-sector and has negative impact on the sustainability of such 
initiatives. Monopoly in generation of fuel wood by public utility has hindered competitive utilization and 
conservation of this resource. There is lack of enabling policy and regulatory mechanism for 
providing level playing field to promote private sector in forest development (generation) and 
management. 
Lack of representation of the weak socio-economic groups in energy planning 
Socio-economic groups of women, Dalit do not have adequate and structured representation in 
the relevant energy organizations. They do not have representation in the energy planning and 
decision making process. This has created feeling of non-ownership among the excluded groups 
of any energy development and planning process in the country. 
Lack of integrated energy planning awareness, education and training 
Awareness of integrated energy planning and management is very low among the people. 
School level education does not offer curricular activity about importance and role of integrated 
and sustainable energy development and security in raising quality of life of the general people. 
Educating future generation on importance of sustainable energy development and security is 
critical to socially optimize the benefits of any national initiative on energy resource development. 
Besides, there is lack of institutions which regularly provide training to fresh trainees and upgrade 
and refresh the skills of existing manpower in energy sub-sectors. Lack of appropriate, regular 
and updated knowledge and skill of the old and new staff in the energy sector for sustainable 
resources management, dissemination-adoption and operation of new and efficient technology 
and quality monitoring has hindered accelerated extension and promotion of energy resources to 
benefit the larger number of people. 
2.1.4.3 Environmental Issues on Traditional Energy
Air pollution 
Though biomass is carbon neutral in terms of Green House Gas (GHG), it emits carbon 
monoxide and other toxic gases due to incomplete combustion in inefficient cooking devices. Use 
of biomass in traditional inefficient stoves causes dirty kitchen as well as indoor air pollution from 
ashes and smokes. This primitive technology has adverse impact on health and local 
environment; especially women and children. 
Environmental degradation 
Unsustainable harvesting and over exploitation of wild forest cause deforestation, soil erosion at 
local level and flooding in sensitive areas. Similarly, smoke emission from traditional energy use 
in domestic, commercial and industry sectors (brick kilns) has caused air pollution. Very often 
unmanaged forest fire occurs, which depletes traditional energy resources, wild life and 
biodiversity. 
Awareness on adverse impact 
User groups of traditional energy resources are not aware of environmental degradation and 
impact on climate change due to excessive burning of fuel wood, animal dung and agricultural 
iditditil iffiit td diMf tht f itf Most of energy requirement (about 90 percent of total energy consumption at base year) is met 
by traditional energy resources; such as fuel wood, animal dung and agricultural residues in 
Nepal. Over dependence on wild forest for energy will cause loss of wild life and biodiversity in 
due course of time. 
2.1.4.4 Social Issues on Traditional Energy 
Lack of knowledge and awareness on the adverse health impacts 
One of the major problems facing the rural areas is the lack of knowledge and awareness among 
people, especially the women folk on the risks and adverse health impacts associated with the 
use of traditional biomass fuels. The smoke and particulate matters coming out as the direct 
burning of the biomass fuel is harmful leading to cough, respiratory tract infections, asthma, eye 
infections, headache, etc. On the other hand shortage of biomass fuel is leading to switching into 
inferior fuel sources which could be even more harmful health-wise and less energy efficient. 
Due to depleting and scarce energy sources, the need to go to distant places and dangerous 
landscapes/forests for collecting forage, fodder and fuel wood renders women and children, who 
are primarily used for this purpose, prone to accidents and even death. Increased work load and 
indoor smoke pollution tend to make rural women quite vulnerable to several health maladies. 
Increased work load and lack of income generating programs 
The necessity to go far for collecting biomass energy and fetching water due to the scarcity of 
traditional biomass energy and depleting water sources adds further to the already bulky work 
load for women. Besides consuming a lot of their physical effort, it leaves them with a very little 
time to indulge in other income generating activities or even community based activities. Further, 
the dearth of biomass energy has brought a halt to a lot of home bound micro enterprises which 
economically empowers rural women. The inadequacy and ineffectiveness of social mobilization 
and income generating program is a hindrance to rural women who have spare time to invest in 
income generating activities. 
The practice of using child labor in collecting traditional biomass energy is a common practice in 
the rural context. More specifically, girls are involved in this activity and hence are deprived from 
the opportunities to go to school. This consequently perpetuates the cycle of female illiteracy and 
the prospect of their growth and development is thus handicapped. 
Lack of knowledge on the use of agri–residue as a source of energy 
 Nepalese economy is predominantly an agrarian economy and agri-residue forms the third 
largest indigenous biomass source of energy in Nepal. Despite the high potential of use of agriresidue for energy purpose, it is primarily used for fodder and compost manure preparation only. 
This is primarily because the technology of producing energy from agri-residue is not brought into 
public interest and people are ignorant about it. Promoting this technology will not only provide 
the rural agriculture-based population with the cheapest and readily available source of energy 
but will also enhance the socio-economic status of people by curtailing their expense on 
purchasing other energy sources. Lack of incentives and opportunities, the trend of migration of skilled manpower and educated 
elites to the urban centers is on rise thus hindering the prospect of improving traditional energy 
use through technological innovations. Also migration of professionals has resulted in brain drain 
in energy sector at different levels. 
Lack of alternative employment opportunities 
There are large populations of marginal poor who are entirely dependent on the illegal cutting 
down and trading of fuel wood to earn their livelihood. Unless alternative employment 
opportunities are provided, this activity cannot cease. Hence, to prevent deforestation and 
depletion of forest it is essential that the concerned agencies make provisions of a different 
source of generating income for these socio-economically disadvantaged populations. 
Inadequate information about private forest management and use 
The scarcity of traditional biomass energy can be compensated by encouraging the private forest 
developers. However, lack of information among the interested groups on the management of 
private forest and its use is an impasse for adopting this practice by the concerned stakeholders. 
Lack of knowledge of economically valuable species 
Due to lack of knowledge on different economically valuable tree species, these are used as fuel 
wood which could otherwise earn substantial revenue. This ignorance is causing economic loss 
not only to the users but to the nation as a whole. 
Lack of awareness on stall feeding 
Due to lack of awareness on stall feeding of cattle, the practice of open and rampant grazing on 
non-pasture lands is still prevalent. This leads to the destruction of young plants and saplings. 
Difficulty in fuel wood procurement for rituals and ceremonial fires 
In spite of being announced secular nation in terms of religion, the Nepalese population is still 
dominated by Hindu majorities. Hence, the depleting firewood source is striking hard time on the 
availability and supply of fuel wood which is a pre-requisite for the rituals and ceremonial fires. 
2.1.4.5 Economic and Financial Issues on Traditional Energy 
Problem of valuable timber used as fuel wood 
Fuel wood is only marketed in urban areas but in rural areas it is used as free gift of nature for 
the daily household consumption. Due to such situation there is not only the problem of 
deforestation but the valuable timber is also used as fuel wood which loses huge resource of 
national property. 
Lack of commercialization of traditional energy resources 
Traditional energy such as fuel wood, agricultural residue and dung is not commercialized. Fuel gy y 
people for their daily livelihood. 
2.1.5 Issues on Commercial Energy 
2.1.5.1 Technical Issues 
Focus on indigenous resources 
The country is becoming alarmingly dependent on petroleum products for its energy requirement. 
The country has huge potential of hydropower energy resources, but harnessing of these 
resources is dismally poor. Hence, the country has to focus in developing the indigenous 
renewable energy resources such as hydropower, solar, wind and bio-energy resources rather 
than depending on imported petroleum products. 
Exploration, production & generation of energy resources in the country 
Though official documents show some reserves of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gases 
in the Western Nepal, in the Southern belt and in Kathmandu valley respectively, the exploration, 
production and development of these reserves have not received much focus. Similarly, current 
development of hydropower resources is quite inadequate for meeting the country’s demand. 
Transport vehicles on efficient energy resources 
Emphasis needs to be given more on the usage of electric vehicles and public transport. 
Individual transport vehicles such as private cars, jeeps, and motorcycles should be replaced by 
mass transport. Development of electric vehicles such as railway systems along the East West 
Highway should come in the list of priority. Necessary emphasis and incentives in the 
development of the Expressway between Kathmandu and Hetauda would significantly save the 
consumption of petroleum products. 
Efficient and quality energy services 
Quality energy service is the right of the consumers. But the existing mechanism of quality 
control in the products and energy services is inadequate and weak. There is a need of a strong 
quality control mechanism in petroleum products and coal. Excessive load shedding is not 
addressed by speedy development of power plant. The adulteration in the petroleum products, 
supply of poor quality coal and electricity losses need to be addressed by giving social penalty to 
people involved. 
Energy transmission 
The transmission infrastructure is of low capacity and is overloaded. It has become the main 
bottleneck in the development and transmission of reliable and quality electricity. Development of 
oil pipeline from Raxaul to Amlekhgunj is approved but is not implemented yet. Focus on hydropower development 
Despite the focus on hydropower development for meeting domestic needs, implementation has 
been weak. This has been mainly due to poor energy planning. The country is facing severe load 
shedding even during the wet season. Industries have been hit very hard. The whole economy 
has suffered. Weak implementation of one-window policy and lack of consistency or continuity of 
taxation policy have been identified as causes for slow rate of progress in implementing planned 
hydropower projects in the private sector. There is also an absence of an effective policy for 
encouraging the use of domestic resources for development of hydropower. 
Inappropriate energy classification 
The existing energy sector classification of traditional, commercial and renewable where 
hydropower is grouped under commercial is not appropriate. 
Regulation of the Oil Sector 
Petroleum products occupy an important place in the supply and distribution of energy in the 
country. Currently this sector has come under various influences from outsideand is not 
functioning as a commercial entity. There is lack of clear law for regulation of this sector. It 
suffers from lack of transparency in import and distributionand market-oriented pricing policy. 
Energy Security 
There is absence of a clear policy and law on storage of oil. Oil is a strategic source of energy 
and in view of nation’s full dependence on imports, its vulnerability is very high. 
Development of indigenous sources 
Energy independence is not a practical proposition. However, in view of the supply completely 
dependent on import, part of the need should be fulfilled by energy sources developed within the 
country. Some degree of self reliance is necessary. Technologies are available for producing 
ethanol and biodiesel for mixing and substituting part of the imported fuels. There is lack of an 
effective policy for developing alternative fuels within the country. 
Energy Efficiency 
Energy efficiency is the most effective source for reducing the supply gap, carbon emissions and 
reliance on expensive imports of petroleum products. There have been a number of initiatives in 
EE, yet it needs more serious attention. Energy efficiency can be achieved through a host of 
measures such as manufacture and use of energy efficient equipments, reduction in system 
losses, proper energy planning and management, efficient transport planning, among others. 
Both supply and demand side efficiencies need to be addressed. 
Energy sector reform, restructuring and governance 
There is lack of effective implementation of power sector restructuring programmesReforms in g gp
Regional Cooperation 
Regional cooperation can play a critical role in ensuring energy security in a sustainable manner. 
Subregional power trade can be an effective way of meeting energy demand. By utilizing 
different peak times of neighbouring countries, regional power trade can reduce the need for 
building new power generation plants in each country. 
2.1.5.3 Institutional Issues on Commercial Energy Sector 
Lack of continuous policy recognition for integrated energy planning at the central level 
WECS's one key responsibility is to act as an overall energy planner, which would especially 
assist the NPC's periodic economic development plan pertaining to energy. With the factors such 
as the political expediencies and vested mercantile sub-sectoral energy interests in oil, forests, 
water and other natural resources sub-sectors provide impetus for the growth of unequal, 
divergent and separate public institution in each energy sub-sector. Each one of these subsectoral public institutions plans and manages energy in its sub-sectors rather independently. 
Although WECS was established for institutionalizing an integrated energy planning process, it 
does not continuously receive policy recognition and support. Therefore, an integrated 
mechanism that links all energy sub-sectors together in terms of effective planning is clearly 
absent. It has been felt that an overall executive body is needed for integrated energy planning. 
Inequitable distribution of benefits from royalty 
Providing royalty solely to district where the hydropower project is located is not equitable. For 
instance – power generation from a hydro installed down-stream is not possible unless the water 
users up-stream allow the water flow. A mechanism is required to share royalty equitably in the 
basin/sub-basin. 
Lack of level playing field in electricity transmission and distribution 
Monopoly in transmission and distribution of electricity by public utility has hindered competition 
of these commodities in the market and hence in electricity generation and consumption. There 
is lack of enabling policy and regulatory mechanism for providing level playing field to promote 
private sector in electricity transmission and distribution as well. 
Lack of level playing field for oil import 
Monopoly in import of oil (petroleum products) by public utility has significantly hindered 
competition of petroleum commodities in the market and hence the petroleum procurement, 
transport and distribution are not efficient. There is lack of enabling policy and regulatory 
mechanism for providing level playing field to promote private sector in oil import, storage, 
transfer and distribution. 
Awareness of integrated energy planning and management stands low. Educating future 
generation on importance of sustainable energy development and security is critical to socially 
optimize the benefits of any national initiative on energy resource developmentBesidesthere is gpggy 
sustainable resources management, dissemination-adoption and operation of new and efficient 
technology and quality monitoring has hindered accelerated extension and promotion of energy 
resources to benefit the larger number of people. 
2.1.5.4 Environmental Issues on Commercial Energy Sector
Pollution tax on fossil fuels 
Excessive use of fossil fuels (coal and petroleum products) in industries, transport, agricultural 
and domestic sector emits toxic emissions causing air pollution and climate change due to 
greenhouse gas emissions. Thus there is a need for policy on pollution taxes on petroleum 
products and reduction in their use. This fund can be used as a cross subsidy for the promotion 
of environment friendly renewable energy technologies. 
Environment impact assessment 
Time frame provided for EIA is too long. Mitigation measures to minimize the environmental 
impacts are not followed strictly and sometimes, the environmental aspects are not seriously 
considered while planning hydro power projects. Similarly, the use of waste land is not 
considered while installing high voltage transmission line. There is a need for simplification of EIA 
for small hydropower projects. 
The environmental assessments are merely taken as “add on burden” to be reckoned at the 
beginning of the project and despite having provisions for appraisal of these assessments once 
the project is constructed, it is not implemented. There is serious lag in monitoring and evaluation 
of post construction and operation of projects. 
Resettlement policy 
There is lack of appropriate resettlement policy at high dam sites. 
2.1.5.5 Social Issues on Commercial Energy Sector
Lack of energy reliability and security 
It is not only the commercial sector that is suffering from the lack of reliability and security in 
energy but it is equally true for the domestic. The concept of human development which means 
easy, affordable and equitable access to all forms of energy supplies and services in this context 
is utterly misconstrued. And this lack of energy security is increasingly threatening the social 
stability of a developing country like Nepal. The access to energy is determined by affordability 
hence energy pricing plays a deciding factor towards making energy accessible. So if energy is 
to be made accessible to all especially to those who have economic constraints, then either the 
imported fuel should be subsidized or indigenous resources should be developed and distributed 
at affordable rates. 
Lack of access to electricity 
Besides other energy sourceselectricity plays a vital role in the development process as it g ppy pg p
energy. With access to electricity, people can work during nights, indulge in income generating 
activities, children and even adults can study at night. However, electricity as a source of energy 
is not accessible to 52% people in our country thus hindering the advances in the livelihood of 
people and overall socio-economic development of the community, region and country as a 
whole. 
Lack of strict enforcement of Social Impact Assessment and conduction of public hearing 
prior to any commercial energy project development 
Despite the mandatory pre-requisite of Social Impact Assessment and public hearing before 
commencing any commercial energy project, the enforcement is still weak. 
Lack of effective mechanism to address the Resettlement and Rehabilitation issue 
Although there is Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy for the people displaced by the energy 
projects, the policy is not effective in addressing this issue hence inviting dissatisfaction from the 
Project Affected People. 
Lack of urban planning 
The ever increasing trend of migration of people to urban centers due to geo-political reasons will 
not only exert population pressure in the urban areas but the lack of urban planning will also 
result in burgeoning squatters and slums. On the other hand this will create an 
imbalancedsituation in the demand and supply of energy sources thus creating energy insecurity, 
supply deficit, environmental deterioration and energy misappropriation and theft. 
Non-implementation of penalty system for those stealing and misappropriating energy 
Despite the provision of penalizing the culprits involved in stealing or misusing energy, as for 
example, electricity, the penalty system is not strictly enforced by the concerned authorities. This 
is not only incurring loss to the country but is encouraging the proliferation of network involved in 
such crime. 
2.1.5.6 Economic Issues on Commercial Energy Sector 
Lack of competitive market price in petroleum sector 
The petroleum product is solely controlled and regulated by NOC. Petroleum products are not 
allowed to be imported freely and marketed at competitive price by the private parties as per the 
liberalization policy of the government. 
Improper pricing of petroleum product 
Petroleum products prices are set by NOC that can be considered as monopoly price. Due to 
absence of competitive market; petroleum price are unjustified because even if the price of LPG 
is currently increased by rupees 200 per cylinder, NOC is claiming a loss of 70 rupees per 
cylinder. If compared with the energy value price of kerosene which is normally used by poor 
people is very much higher than LPG in terms of energy content value. There is huge scope of producing hydropower but due to the financial constraint of the 
government it cannot be materialized. Investment in hydropower is financially beneficial but the 
government is unable to attract the private producers and foreign investors to invest and boost 
up the hydropower development. 
Lack of initiative for using local resources 
Financial institutions and banking sector are unable to use 200 billions of rupees which is 
equivalent to 50% of the total assets of commercial banks. As it is clear that IPPs are in profit in 
hydroelectricity, banking institutions with surplus funds must be attracted to invest in energy 
production. 
Lack of differential electricity and energy price 
Differential electricity and other commercial energy price are required to abide by the equity 
principle. At present the situation is reverse the kerosene price in Jumla and Humla is much 
higher than Kathmandu. Actually the price of kerosene in these rural areas must be cheaper than 
other urban areas. There is no subsidy and facility in case of commercial energy for the support 
of the rural poor. But there is no government control over the forest which is accessed as free. 
Affordable cost of energy services 
Affordability is most essential precondition of the energy supply services. But the issue to provide 
energy at affordable cost is very controversial term and is very hard to meet because NEA and 
NOC, the major commercial energy providers, are claiming that they are in huge loss. 
Absence of energy conservation/ efficiency 
Energy saving or energy conservation is equivalent to energy production. Huge investments are 
required for electricity production. On an average, about 2000 USD is required to produce one 
KW of hydroelectricity, so, it is required to promote energy conservation and energy efficiency. 
2.1.6 Issues on Renewable Energy Sector 
2.1.6.1 Technical Issues 
Issues on bio-gas technology 
Energy can be produced from human excreta and other biomass, however to bring this into 
implementation, raising public awareness and emphasizing technological utility is not given much 
attention. There is a lack of subsidy on the production of biogas from household garbage. 
Technical knowledge on the production of biogas from the by-products of vegetable farming 
residues is not well known to common people. 
Issues on micro-hydro power 
There are no practices to take advantage of multiple benefits from water use. Water used for 
micro-hydro can also be used for water mill and irrigation which is not considered in design of 
micro-hydro projects. The traditional water mill can be improved to produce electricity hence py y qgp
of micro hydro sector is still hampering in the micro hydro power generation. 
Issues on solar energy 
The major issues are insufficient knowledge on the technology of cooking food from solar energy, 
its capacity and general feasibility. Sustainability of solar energy technology is another important 
consideration in this regard. Subsidy has been a debatable issue in this sector. 
Issues on wind energy 
Detail assessment of wind energy production is necessary before having any wind energy project 
in the country. High cost technology is the major reason not to have such wind energy projects. 
Mapping of solar, wind and modern biomass energy technology is needed as a part of resource 
assessment. 
Issues on other renewable energy (bio-fuel, briquette) 
There is in-adequate exploration and implementation of other viable renewable energies; such as 
bio-diesel, ethanol. Concept of commercially developing drumstick (biodiesel plant) as an 
alternative to petroleum products is also lacking. Plantation of bio-fuel plants like Khirro- Kadam 
is not emphasized for bio-energy. Technology development related with bio energy production is 
still in preliminary stage. Technical knowledge in producing bio briquette is also not matured. 
Briquette use is found expensive. 
2.1.6.2 Policy Issues on Renewable Energy 
Cumbersome subsidy procedures 
There are cumbersome procedures and a centralized system of subsidy delivery mechanism. 
The current subsidy policy is designed according to the administrative classification of districts 
which fails to address the requirements of the people who actually need such support. In 
addition, the amount of subsidy is also not appropriate. 
Credit facility 
Interest on credit for rural energy technologies is high. People for whom the credit facility has 
been targeted simply cannot afford. There is problem of collaterals. 
Energy Master Plan 
There is absence of information base in the district to avail the facility speedily. A few districts 
have master plan of energy resources developed. Many districts lack such information. 
Lack of awareness 
There is wide scale lack of awareness about the policy in the districts. Even the authorities who 
are supposed to supervise implementation of these programmes have been found ignorant about 
the details of policy provisions and delivery mechanisms. Some who had knowledge expressed 
reservations about efficacy of the programmeThe programme suffers from interferenceThe procedure for refund of VAT is cumbersome, and in most cases unpractical. 
Research and development 
Research and development programme on renewable energy is inadequate. 
2.1.6.3 Institutional Issues on Renewable Energy 
Lack of recognition to and prioritization of indigenous water resource as the lead energy 
sub-sector in integrated energy planning 
Indigenous renewable energy resources like water lack effective recognition and prioritization 
while planning energy resources development. Ministries and departments involved in planning 
and development operate under their sectoral/sub-sectoral regulation and for their own target 
lack co-ordination. Such a situation was a result of an institutional arrangement where divergent 
public agencies dominated their respective energy sub-sector and no agency is clearly specified 
as a lead agency that is responsible for integrated energy planning. 
Lack of capability for integrated energy planning 
The system and process for integrated energy planning in the existing sub-sectoral energy 
planning processes is lacking at present. This has resulted in lack of an integrated energy 
planning practices, a right energy mix framework (giving strategic priority to potential indigenous 
resources) and a pricing system-appropriate enough for the whole energy sector on a nationwide basis. Besides, lack of integrated energy planning both at the central and local levels has 
also constrained the national ability to comprehend, envision, investigate and cash internal and 
external market benefits offered by opportunities such as carbon trading. An institution is, 
therefore needed to be specified as a lead agency that is responsible for integrated energy 
planning to put in place the system and processes and accordingly strengthen the capability 
accordingly. 
Ineffective information dissemination through responsible institutions 
The institutions responsible to handle renewable energy related matters have weak mechanism 
for effective information dissemination regarding subsidies and technology adoption and updates. 
2.1.6.4 Environmental Issues 
Environment impact assessment 
There is an inadequate implementation of mitigation measures towards environmental 
assessment. 
Battery disposal 
There is lack of rules and regulation regarding the disposal of batteries of solar home system. 
Many users are not aware of negative environmental impact of lead acid batteries. Users are not aware of attaching toilets to biogas plants and there is no subsidy policy for it. Also 
there is lack of information to users that biogas can be generated from the solid waste. Similarly 
information dissemination is lacking for the disposal of agricultural field residues, municipal and 
industrial residues. 
Air pollution 
Ashes and smokes are the main sources of indoor air pollution. Similarly, burning fuel wood in 
brick kilns causes air pollution to the surroundings. 
2.1.6.5 Social Issues 
Inadequate information dissemination and lack of knowledge 
Exploration, development and use of other energy sources apart from the traditional biomass 
energy and commercial energy are still a new and emerging concept in the domestic sector. 
Therefore, providing knowledge and creating awareness among the people regarding 
investment, use, conservation and underlying opportunities in energy sector specifically 
renewable energy entails a thorough exercise. In order to reduce the dependence on traditional 
and commercial energy sources, use of renewable energy is the only alternative as a cheaper, 
easier and environmentally friendly technology. For this purpose, extensive information 
dissemination on these aspects needs to be done fervently to increase interest and gather active 
participation from the stakeholders and the general public. Moreover, lack of knowledge on the 
renewable energy technologies, is also depriving people from socio-economic, environmental 
and health benefits that can be reaped by using renewable energy like biogas, micro-hydro, 
improved cook stove, solar home systems, etc. As for example, dung cakes are a very common 
source of biomass producing a very inferior energy. However, the same animal residue when 
used in biogas plant can produce environment, health and pocket friendly energy. 
Besides providing information on renewable energy, awareness regarding the effective, optimum 
and efficient utilization of other traditional and commercial energy sources needs to be 
disseminated among people, as for example, promoting power saving CFL/LED in areas having 
access to electricity. 
Lack of proactive involvement and opportunities for women 
There are very few women professionals in energy sector and these handful of professionals 
have negligible representation in the policy, decision-making and implementation level. Major 
portion of energy is utilized by the domestic sector and hence women are the major role players 
when it comes to energy use and conservation. It is therefore imperative to actively involve and 
seek participation of women in energy sector both at the professional level and at grass root 
level. There is an apparent lack of women professionals in energy sector who can contribute in 
making policy and taking decisions. Similarly, at the grass root level, there is insignificant 
involvement of women in taking community level decisions. Women at the grass root level can be 
involved in promoting, training and using renewable energy technologies, conservation of energy 
and its optimum utilization and creating awareness on the harmful impacts of traditional energy 
use. This will not only build their capacity but also instill a sense of belonging and responsibility in 
the development arena. Equity being directly linked with sustainable development is a very crucial issue in the social 
context. Development initiatives which are lagging in terms of equal distribution of benefits and 
services for all may not be sustainable and call for a shift in the development paradigm. It is 
realized that the energy projects which do not take local development, distribution of benefits and 
participation of rural poor, Dalits, marginalized people and other deprived communities into 
consideration are not sustainable. This lack of ownership and accessibility by the local 
communities leads to the non-sustainability of such efforts and hinders in bringing these groups 
into the development mainstream. 
Rather than concentrating only on energy security, reliability and accessibility, it is equally 
essential to analyze the energy choices and priorities of different groups and communities to 
make energy projects completely socially inclusive and sustainable. Hence, the development of 
various model of participatory resource management process depending on the geographical set 
up needs to be implemented more effectively. 
Inadequate local ownership/participation 
Except in demand driven community based energy projects, the local participation in the projects 
developed by external investors is negligible. This has created a gap between the project owners 
and the local community whereby the of ownership by the community towards the project has 
become an issue. Energy projects developed without taking local development into account 
cannot be sustainable. This lack of equity leads to a state of social dissatisfaction and conflict. 
Lack of curriculum 
Energy being the engine of overall growth and development of a country, it is an issue of primary 
concern to every citizen and hence everyone should be acquainted with the basic concepts in 
energy. The teachers, students, laymen, housewives and professionals in different sectors must 
understand the fundamental concepts of energy as everybody is inevitably associated with 
energy in some way or the other. Hence, the best way to achieve this is through the introduction 
of curriculum on energy at all levels of educational strata. 
Lack of public awareness on policy process 
Lots of interest is emerging from the public/private investors in energy sector development. 
However, lack of knowledge or inadequate awareness about the policy process involved is 
creating certain complexities in the course and therefore is not attracting the investors to the 
desired extent. Similarly, unawareness about other policy processes associated with energy 
sector and of direct relevance to the general public and stakeholders is problematic. 
Cultural barrier 
Due to different cultural practices adopted by people and the values they adhere to, sometimes it 
may create difficulty in abandoning traditional energy use practices due to users’ reluctance in 
adopting alternative unfamiliar sources/practices against their norms and values. As for example, 
due to attachment of toilet to biogas plant, some people in rural areas may not accept this 
technology as an alternative to using the traditional biomass energy. Lack of income generation of poverty people 
Energy is considered as one of the major input for the development of the society. The 
renewable energy programs must be integrated with rural development program along with the 
income generating activities of the rural people to raise the income of the poverty people. 
Lack of credit and subsidy facility for the development of improved technology 
Energy efficiency is a must in all improved technology including ICS, solar home system, biogas 
system, wind energy etc. The development of efficient and improved technology in all energy 
resources and its application is lagging due to the lack of credit and subsidy facility for the 
development of improved technology in energy sector 
Lack of initiative to produce solar panel by the country 
There is lack of initiative to produce solar panel by the country. Solar panels are very costly and 
import duty is exempted by the government, which incurs a huge financial loss to the nation. But 
this can be curbed if solar panel can be produced in within the country.Chapter 3: Energy Scenarios Analysis 
While formulating the national energy strategy, three different future energy demands with 
respect to economic growth are assessed. These scenarios are: 
 Business As Usual (BAU) case with an average GDP growth rate of 3.9 percent 
 Reference case with an average GDP growth rate of 5.6 percent 
 Accelerated growth case with an average GDP growth rate of 8.6 percent 
Such future energy demands are analyzed considering the energy demand situation of 2004/05 
as the base year. For policy analysis, reference scenario of 5.6 percent GDP growth rate is 
considered as South Asia’s overall economy was growing at an average growth rate of 5 percent 
(IMF, 2006) during the period 2001 -2005. Further, it seems possible for Nepal to move in line 
with South Asia's GDP growth rate in the years to come. 
BAU Scenario (Baseline Scenario) 
In this scenario, analysis of future energy demand is made, assuming the average GDP growth 
rate equal to 3.9 percent. Another assumption is that the share of each demand technology in the 
energy supply in future years will be the same and similar consumption trends will continue in 
future as in the base year. 
The expected final consumptions of various fuels in this scenario are presented in the table 3.1. 
The total energy consumption in 2030 is expected to grow to a value of 1184 million GJ from the 
base year value of 369 million GJ. The per capita energy consumption for 2030 is expected to 
stand at 29 GJ.

Reference Scenario or Interim Plan Scenario 
This scenario assumes that the average GDP growth rate will be according to interim plan i.e 
with an average GDP growth rate of 5.6 percent. It further assumes that the share of each 
demand technology in the energy supply in future years will be the same as in the base year. 
The projected final consumptions of various fuels in this scenario have been given in Table 3.4. 
The total energy consumption in 2030 is expected to grow to a value of 1301 million GJ from the 
base year value of 369 million GJ. The per capita energy consumption for 2030 will stand at 33 
GJ.

electricity projection for 2015 is expected to achieve 100 KWh which seems to be surpassed as 
projected in this scenario if the national economy grows at 5.6 percent. 
3.1.1 Energy Indicators at Reference case or Interim Plan Scenario 
Much of the current energy supply and use, based, as it is, on limited resources of biomass and 
fossil fuels, is deemed to be environmentally unsustainable. Combustion of fossil fuels is chiefly 
responsible for urban air pollution, regional acidification and the risk of human-induced climate 
change. Moreover, about one-third of the world’s population still relies on the use of animal 
power and traditional biomass fuels. Some 1.7 billion people in the world have no access to 
electricity. Many areas in the world have no reliable and secure energy supplies. This lack of 
access to modern energy services severely limits socioeconomic development — an integral part 
of sustainable development. Nonetheless, because of improved technology and an increased 
understanding of the effects and impacts of energy and energy systems, a developing country 
today can make the transition from an agricultural to an industrial economy with much lower 
costs and with less environmental damage than today’s developed countries were subjected to 
during their transition (IAEA, 2005). 
When choosing energy fuels and associated technologies for the production, delivery and use of 
energy services, it is essential to consider economic, social and environmental consequences. 
Measurement and assessment of current and future effects of energy use on human health, 
human society, air, soil and water as well as examining the sustainability of the energy use 
require due attention. The strategy has analyzed some energy indicators with and without policy 
interventions.

The above Table 3.7 indicates that per capita final energy consumption is almost doubled to 33 
GJ in 2030 from the value of 2005. Per capita electricity consumption is expected to grow from 
67 KWh in 2005 to 672 KWh in 2030. There is general improvement in energy intensity as it 
decreases to 39 GJ/1000$ in 2030 from 43 GJ/1000$ in 2005. Electricity intensity increases to 
801 KWh/1000$ in 2030 from 195 KWh/1000$ in the base year. The power utilization of the 
potential hydropower improves to 18 percent in 2030 from slightly more than 1 percent in 2005. 
The final energy used per household increases to 124 GJ in 2030 from 76 GJ in 2005. The share 
of non-carbon energy in the total primary energy is less at 7.4 percent in 2030 which was 2 
percent in 2005. It indicates that most of the energy consumed are carbon based and remains so 
if no policy intervention is done in time. Similarly, share of renewable energy in total primary 
energy moves from 12 percent in 2005 to 15 percent in 2030. There is little improvement in the 
use of renewable energy. The ratio of net imports to total primary energy supply in physical terms 
increases to 28 percent in 2030 from 11 percent in 2005. It shows that the dependence on 
imported energy fuels is increasing. Furthermore, the GHG emitted due to energy use rises from 
474 Kg per capita in 2005 to 1,432 Kg in 2030 which is almost three times from the emission 
value in base year 2005. Despite, having low carbon dioxide emission intensity compared to 
other developing countries (1,650 Kg/capita), developed countries (10,960 Kg/capita) and world 
average (3,890 Kg/capita) in 2002 (Winkler, 2007), Nepal is suffering from climate change 
hazards and paying serious attention for climate change adaptation. 
Accelerated Growth Scenario or High Growth Scenario 
In this scenario GDP growth rate is assumed to be high, i.e. with an average GDP growth rate of 
8.6 percent. Similarly, the share of each demand technology in the energy supply in future years 
will be the same as in the base year. 
The final consumptions of various fuels in this scenario have been given in Table 3.8. The total 
energy consumption in 2030 is expected to grow to a value of 1642 Million GJ from the base year 
value of 369 Million GJ. The per capita energy consumption for 2030 will be 40 GJ.

The cumulative growth rate of total primary energy consumption in the period upto 2030 will be 
6.2 percent. The consumption of fuelwood, which is already beyond sustainable limits, will 
continue to grow although its share will decrease. Fuelwood consumption will be unsustainable 
throughout the planning horizon. Electricity consumption will significantly grow by as much as 26 
times from 2005 to 2030.

electricity and petroleum in the period 2005 – 2030 will be 4 percent, 14 percent and 12 percent 
respectively.

The sectoral energy consumption pattern will be as per Table 3.9. The energy consumption 
share of residential sector will be 83 percent in 2015 and 53 percent in 2030. Likewise, the share 
of industrial sector in 2015 and 2030 will be respectively 5 percent and 17 percent. Commercial 
sector will consume 4 percent in 2015 and 21 percent in 2030 of the total energy consumptions.

Comparison of the energy scenarios 
The variation of future energy demand in different time horizon of the strategy period is shown in 
Table 3.11. WECS has estimated the total energy consumption in 2004/05 equal to about 367 
Million GJ. However, the energy model prepared for assessing the future energy demand was 
calibrated to about 369 Million GJ for the base year 2005. In the base case, the growth of 
average gross domestic product of 3.9% and average growth rate of total energy consumption of 
5 percent was considered.

Accelerated growth 369.2 451.0 561.7 1642.2
In case of medium growth scenario, the cumulative growth rate of primary fuel consumption will 
be 5.2 percent. The annual growth rate of petroleum products will be 10 percent and that of 
electricity will be 12 percent during the study horizon. Fuel wood will be the dominant fuel, 
surpassing the sustainable limit throughout the analysis period. 
Similarly, the cumulative growth rate of total primary energy consumption in the accelerated 
growth scenario will be 6.2 percent. The consumption of fuel wood, which is already beyond 
sustainable limits, will continue to grow, although, its share will decrease. Fuel wood 
consumption will be unsustainable throughout the planning horizon. Electricity consumption will 
significantly grow by as much as 26 times from 2005 to 2030. 
While comparing the total fuel consumption in different scenarios, there will be more than 38% 
energy demand in accelerated growth case in 2030 as compared to the base case. Whereas just 
about 9% more energy is required in medium growth scenario compared to the base case in 
2030. However, there are no such big differences in total energy consumption among the three 
scenarios in the year 2010 and 2015. The peak power plant capacity requirement is shown in 
Table 3.12. The peak power plant requirement for 2015 in the base case will be 1,300 MW and 
in 2030, 6,300 MW. Per capita electricity consumption reaches 521 KWh in 2030 from 67 KWh in 
the base year. Scenarios

The power plant requirement in the medium growth scenario (reference case) for 2030 will be 
7,648 MW. Per capita electricity consumption in this scenario will be 124 KWh in 2015 and 672 
KWh in 2030 respectively. Comparing with the per capita electricity of 100 KWh as projected in 
interim plan 2007-2010 for the year 2015, the per capita electricity surpassed with the value of 
124 KWh if the national economy grows at 5.6 percent. The power plant requirement in the 
accelerated growth scenario for 2030 will be 12,053 MW. The per capita electricity consumption 
increases to 548 KWh in 2025 and 1,144 KWh in 2030 respectively. 
Strategic Interventions at Reference Scenario 
Considering the possibility of continuously attaining the 5.6% GDP growth rate, the strategic 
interventions are made on the reference case (5.6% GDP growth rate). The main strategic 
interventions are: 
1. Introduction of Clean Energy Technology at Reference Scenario 
2. Penetration of energy efficient lighting at Reference Scenario 
3. Introduction of New Transportation Technology at Reference Scenario 
4. Combined policy measures (clean energy, penetration of energy efficient lighting and New 
transport technology) at Reference Scenario 
3.1.2 Introduction of Clean Energy Technology at Reference Scenario 
The following are the major assumptions of this scenario. 
i) GDP growth rate according to reference case. 
ii) Traditional fuels and fossil fuels replaced by electricity and/or fossil fuels. The useful energy 
shares of demand technologies using fuel wood or fossil fuels will decrease at the rate of: 
 For Industrial and Commercial sectors, traditional and fossil fuels decreased by 20 
percent of base year share in 2020 and 30 percent in 2030. They are replaced by 
electricity. 
 For Residential Urban sector, fuel wood share decreased by 50 percent of base year 
share in 2020 and 75 percent in 2030. It is replaced by electricity, kerosene and LPG. 
 For Residential Rural sector fuel wood share decreased by 10 percent in 2020 and 30 
percent in 2030. It is replaced by electricity, kerosene and LPG. 
 For Residential Rural other demands, agri-residue share decreased by 20 percent in 
2020 and 80 percent in 2030. It is replaced by kerosene. 
iii) Traditional fuel wood stoves in residential and commercial sectors replaced by improved 
cook stoves (ICS) at the rate of 25 percent in 2020 and then linearly to 50 percent in 2030.

Figure 3.10 shows the pattern of energy consumption. Compared to reference case, there is a 
decrease in fuel consumption. In 2015, the total energy consumption will be 96 percent and in 
2030 this will be 79 percent of the consumption in reference case.

Table 3.14 shows the sectoral energy consumption pattern in this scenario. The average growth 
rates of commercial, industrial and transportation sectors are respectively 14 percent, 10 percent 
and 8 percent. In 2030, residential sector will be consuming only 61.1 percent of total energy, 
transportation sector 10.3 percent, industrial sector 13.4 percent, and commercial sector 14.5 
percent. Significant decrease in residential share from 84.1 percent in 2015 to 61.1 percent in 
2030 is observed as the energy used for residential purpose are replaced by more cleaner and 
efficient technology. 
The peak hydropower plant installation capacity requirement to support the clean energy 
technology is shown in Table 3.15. The peak power plant requirement for 2030 will be 12,053 
MW. This requirement is 58 percent higher than that of reference case scenario. Further, Per 
capita consumption of electricity rises to 1,144 KWh in 2030 from 67 KWh in the base year.

and then linearly to 75 percent in 2030 
iii) Transmission and distribution losses of electricity grid reduced from 25 percent in base year 
to 20 percent in 2015, and then linearly to 10 percent in 2030 
The final consumptions of various fuels in this scenario have been given in Table 3.16. The total 
energy consumption in 2030 is expected to grow to a value of 1293 million GJ. Per capita energy 
consumption for 2030 will be 33 GJ.

reduced with the use of energy efficient technologies such as CFLs and other energy efficient 
lighting. 
3.1.4 Introduction of New Transportation Technology at Reference Scenario 
The following are the major assumptions in this case: 
i) GDP growth rate according to reference case. 
ii) Electric and hybrid cars introduced. Diesel and petrol cars to be reduced by 10 percent of 
reference case in 2020, 20 percent in 2025, and 30 percent in 2030. Electric cars will be 
substituting at the rate of 5 percent in 2020, 10 percent in 2025, and 15 percent in 2030. 
Hybrid cars will be substituting the remaining as 5 percent in 2020, 10 percent in 2025, 15 
percent in 2030, 
iii) Ethanol and bio-diesel mixing in petrol and diesel respectively. Ethanol mix 10 percent 2020 
onwards and 20 percent in 2030. Bio-diesel mix 5 percent 2020 onwards and 10 percent in 
2030, and 
iv) Transmission and distribution losses of electricity grid reduced from 25 percent in base year 
to 20 percent in 2015, and then linearly to 10 percent in 2030. 
The final consumptions of various fuels in this scenario is given in Table 3.19. The total energy

Figure 3.14 shows the energy consumption pattern upto 2030. Compared to the reference case, 
there is a decrease in petroleum fuel consumption. In 2015, the petroleum consumption will be 1 
percent less than that of reference scenario while same will be 4 percent less in 2030. Bio-fuels 
such as ethanol and Bio-diesel will occupy 3 percent of the transport fuels in 2030. 
Figure 29: Fuel consumption in new transport Technology penetration at reference scenario
The average growth rate of the petroleum consumption at reference case from 2020 to 2030 is 
expected to be 19 percent which is reduced to 18.6 percent due to intervention of new transport 
technology.

without intervention. However, percentage ratio of diesel and petrol consumption in 2030 is lower 
than that at reference case. At 2030 diesel share is found to be decreased from 7.4 percent to 
6.6 percent and petrol from 0.9 percent to 0.7 percent.

average growth rates of energy consumptions in commercial, industrial and transportation 
sectors are respectively 15 percent, 10 percent and 8 percent respectively. In 2030, residential 
sector will be consuming 67 percent of total energy, transportation sector 8 percent, industrial 
sector 11 percent, and commercial sector 14 percent. 
The peak hydropower plant capacity requirement is shown in Table 3.21. The power plant

The per capita electricity consumption in 2030 will be 679 KWh which is 10 times the electricity 
consumption in the base year. Despite the use of electricity in substituting motor fuels, the peak 
power demand is decreased with the expectation of improvement in the transmission and 
distribution losses.

energy shares of demand technologies using fuel wood or fossil fuels will decrease at the 
rate of: 
 For Industrial and Commercial sectors, traditional and fossil fuels decreased by 20 
percent of base year share in 2020 and 30 percent in 2030. They are replaced by 
electricity. 
 For Residential Urban sector, fuel wood share decreased by 50 percent of base year

and then linearly to 75 percent in 2030 
v) Electric and hybrid cars introduced. Diesel and petrol cars demand capacity reduced by 10 
percent of reference case in 2020, 20 percent in 2025, and 30 percent in 2030. Electric 
cars substituting the capacity at the rate of 5 percent in 2020, 10 percent in 2025, 15

In the combined case, as the policy measures of introduction of more highly efficient energy 
sources in the energy ladder than in the reference case are adopted, per capita final energy 
consumption stands at 23 GJ in 2030 which is almost 50 percent less than that in the reference 
case. 
In the combined scenario, per capita electricity consumption will rise to 1,070 KWh in 2030 
compared to 672 KWh in the reference case. This increase is caused by the substitution of fossil 
fuels, biomass solids by cleaner energy sources in industries, commercial (service), and 
residential sectors.

has increased in the combined case compared to the reference case from 2015 onwards. The 
indicator attains a value of 35 percent in 2030 in combined case compared to 28 percent in the 
reference case in physical quantities. Though the percentage values show import dependence 
increasing, however in absolute terms, the imports are declining. The biomass solid fuels are 
being replaced by fuels in the intermediate rung in the energy ladder firstly, by kerosene and 
LPG and then only, by electricity. 
Overall, all these indicators show that Nepal can have a sustainable, affordable, and secure 
energy supply and meet its growing demand by harnessing its indigenous energy resources and 
deploying modern but available technologies in the end use processes. Chapter 4: National Energy Policy Principles 
Vision 
To meet the demand for energy services of the people of Nepal by ensuring security, 
sufficiency, and sustainability for the economic development of the nation through the 
efficient use of the indigenous energy resources. 
Strategic Objectives 
The major strategic objectives are to: 
1. ensure sustainability in the consumption of biomass energy resources 
2. develop hydropower resources as the lead energy resources 
3. reduce foreign dependency on imported fossil fuels 
4. provide an adequate supply of energy at reasonable and affordable price 
5. promote renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency 
6. minimize detrimental environmental effects resulting from energy supply and use 
Hydropower needs to be considered as the lead energy resources as socio-economic 
development of the country depends on its proper exploitation. Furthermore, they are clean 
energy and have hardly any GHG emission on their conversion to electricity. Because of higher 
efficiency in electric end-use technologies or devices, the useful energy obtained will be higher 
than energy received from technologies using traditional energy sources. In the combined 
scenario, the useful energy to be obtained from hydropower conversion will be higher than that of 
traditional energy sources in 2030. 
Policy principles are the guidelines or philosophy for the development of policy. Policy is 
designed to effectively direct the development strategies and activities towards the vision. Here, 
policy principles and policy for energy sub-sectors are explained below: 
 Principles of Energy Sector 
Principles of the overall energy sector are summarized as follows: 
1. Supply of quality energy is critical to nearly everything we do in life and work. Lack of 
adequate supply of commercial energy and electricity in particular has, over the years, 
hindered overall development of the country. Heavy dependence on traditional biomassbased fuels, which are mostly obtained from forests, has resulted in deforestation and 
damage to the environment. A heavy and growing dependence on imported oil is not only 
alarming but also is detrimental to energy security of the country. 
2. There exist constraints in the supplies of Biomass, oil and electricity and there is lack of 
coordinated efforts among the sub-sector agencies to address the supply and management 
of energy. Several agencies including the ministries of water resources (now energy and 
irrigation), commerce and supplies, environment, science and technology, forest and soil ppy 
Development has hindered the development of biomass and other renewable energy 
sources and a large amount of scarce public resources have gone to subsidize imported 
petroleum products due to politicization and the inability to adjust prices to world market. 
 
3. The formulation of energy strategy therefore is directed towards developing a national 
strategy in a manner consistent with the overall objectives of economic growth and 
socioeconomic development while protecting the natural environment for a sustainable 
development of the economy. The energy sector needs to plan and develop energy 
infrastructure and facilities that meet the needs of residential, industrial, commercial, 
transport and agriculture sectors by making available adequate supply of all forms of energy 
in an integrated manner. 
4. The above state of affairs requires Nepal to emphasize on exploiting its indigenous 
renewable energy sources and it is also essential for energy security of the country. Nepal 
needs to follow a development strategy that plans for the future while meeting the needs of 
today. Such an energy policy aims to combating climate change, limiting dependency on 
imports, promoting growth and providing secure and affordable energy to consumers. Nepal 
also can set an example of a GHG emission-free growth model. 
5. The national energy strategy is guided by three basic principles: 
 The strategy is long term oriented and comprehensive 
 The strategy will increase energy supplies and encourage cleaner, more efficient energy 
use 
 The strategy will integrate energy, environmental and economic factors 
6. The strategy has been designed to meet five specific national goals: 
 Increase renewable energy supplies 
 Increase energy security 
 Promote efficiency in the use of energy 
 Reduce and or limiting dependency on imported fuels 
 Provide secure and affordable energy to all consumers 
 Protect the environment 
The energy strategy is built around the central aims of promoting domestic energy sources to 
meet the demand, providing secure and affordable energy to all consumers, keep fuelwood 
consumption under a sustainable level, limit or reduce dependency on fossil fuels in the long run 
and improve the sector governance. 
Sectoral Energy Strategy 
Energy Strategies on respective energy sub-sectors are explained below: 
4.1.1 Hydropower Development 
Strategic actions and plans for development of power sector are generally directed towards 
mega hydro power development and electricity export. The slow pace of development of 
hydropower in Nepal has made us to learn the lesson hard way that there is no alternative to g g, 
modern fuels like electricity. The thrust will be to gradually increase the share of hydropower in 
the energy mix of the country. It can also distinguish itself in the future as an exporter of CO2-
effective energy. 
The rising demand for energy in the process and particularly in the short-to-medium term, 
however, will need to be met by importing fossil fuels until the development of hydropower picks 
up. Nepal’s future lies in utilizing the potential of water as the main source of energy. 
Development of indigenous sources such as wind and solar energy will help ensure energy 
security. 
There is a need to develop and implement a fast track package of accelerated development of 
small hydropower projects up to 25 MW capacity with soft loans and other facilities. This will not 
only establish a base for indigenous capacity for hydropower development in the country, it will 
also provide a solution to energy problem in the short-to-medium term. Activities, incentives and 
concessions under the package include: 
1. Prepare a basin-wise list of projects that do not conflict with other uses or affect benefits from 
existing projects and implement a time bound programme for their approval including 
clearance from concerned agencies such as forests and ministry of environment. It will help 
us plan development where the load of demand is. 
2. Prepare the sites/locations on a GIS platform. 
3. Ensure water rights of power projects. 
4. Offer to sign PPA at a standard wet and dry season rates with a provision of price escalation.
 
5. Offering fiscal and financial incentives including loans for development of power projects. If 
payment of subsidy is involved as incentive, arrange for a system where payment is made 
after the project is operational. 
6. Provide tax holiday as infrastructure projects. 
7. Declare hydropower investment as priority sector. 
8. Encourage utilization of domestic capital by issuing "power bond". 
9. Create a hydropower development consulting service center in the public sector for providing 
expert advice and evaluation of technical proposals before sanctioning of loan proposals. 
 
10. Create appropriate authorities to address the problems of land acquisition and R&R for all 
infrastructure projects. There is a need to insulate project developers and authorities from 
problems arising out of land acquisition, resettlement & rehabilitation. Demands for 
employment in lieu of the land cost, land for land at places of land-owner's choice or 
problems of similar kind need resolution. All such costs incurred by developers can be 
considered as cost to the project and allowed to be passed through tariff. Arrangements can 
also be made, with the agreement of landowners, to invest a particular amount of the 
compensation received as shares in the power project. 
There is a need to encourage capacity utilization of current generation facilities. Poor py py 
Develop and implement a plan with annual milestones to bring down transmission and 
distribution losses through community participation, effective enforcement and incentives to 
consumers. The measure for controlling losses over the years has not been particularly 
encouraging, or is rather dismal. The average losses in the NEA system of 23.7 percent in five 
years between 2056/57 and 2060/61 have actually been on the rise, at an average of 25 percent, 
in the last three years e.g., from 2061/62 to 2063/64. The loss, for example, in 2063/64 was 
24.94 percent which is equivalent to 90 MW, the capacity of Kulekhani I and II. 
The policy principles in the hydropower sub-sector are: 
1. Development and management of renewable sources of energy shall be undertaken in a 
sustainable way addressing environmental concerns. 
2. Development of hydropower shall be promoted as a “lead” sector to meet the short as well as 
long term demand for energy of all sectors by streamlining and simplifying the procedures for 
environment and forest clearances. 
3. Adequate transmission infrastructures shall be developed for facilitation and utilization of 
added capacity generation. 
4. Appropriate financing arrangements, system of targeted subsidy and incentive mechanisms 
shall be developed to promote micro hydropower projects for solution of energy problems in 
rural and remote areas. 
5. Energy efficiency and conservation shall be promoted by setting standards, incentive 
mechanisms and stronger actions. 
6. Conducive environment with consistent fiscal and tax incentives shall be promoted to 
encourage foreign and domestic private sector participation in hydropower development. 
7. A “National Power Development Fund” shall be set-up with a levy of “Power Development 
Cess” on electricity consumed in the country for a faster development of power sector in the 
country. A “Power Development Bond” shall be issued for mobilization of internal resources 
for development of power sector. 
4.1.2 Efficiency and Conservation 
Major areas where efficiency in energy use needs to be developed are electricity generation, 
transmission, and distribution, industrial production and processes, transport systems, building 
design, lighting and household appliances. 
Mandatory periodic energy audit for power intensive industries, for example, is one of the 
measures of energy conservation. Other industries may also be encouraged to adopt energy 
audits and energy conservation measures. 
Better use must be made of existing energy-efficient technologies such as low-energy light bulbs, 
and solar panels for hot water. The policy measure of an accelerated phase-out of traditional 
incandescent light bulbs will not only help reduce hours of load shedding but will also allow lead 
time for arranging new capacity additions. The benefits of phasing-out of inefficient incandescent 
light bulbs will be greater if done within a short period of time say two yearsIn the first stage of ggy g
considerable, the immediate impact may not be that visible. Because a large number of 
consumers fall in the category of lifeline consumption level of 20 units where there is no incentive 
to save energy. They have to pay the minimum charge for 20 units. Besides, there is large scale 
theft and pilferage in consumption where it will be difficult to measure benefits. In order to make 
this move really effective, other measures should accompany the efficiency drive of energy 
efficient lamps like compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and LEDs. The lowering of customs on the 
energy efficient lamps will have an impact on large consumers. Similarly, establishing energy 
performance standards and labeling of electrical appliances and equipments will help enhance 
energy saving by the use of more energy efficient appliances and equipments. 
4.1.3 New Renewable (Alternative Energy) 
The development objective will be to improve the living conditions of the rural population by 
enhancing their access and affordability to rural energy solutions that are environment-friendly 
and that address social justice. The mission is to make renewable energy a mainstream 
development approach. For villages where grid connectivity would not be feasible or not cost 
effective, off-grid solutions based on stand-alone systems may be taken up for supply of 
electricity. Where these also are not feasible and if only alternative is to use isolated lighting 
technologies like solar photovoltaic, these may be adopted. A Master Plan for the Alternative 
Energy Development will be prepared in line National Energy Strategy of the country. The policy 
principles include: 
 Acceleration of rural electrification and alternative energy shall be promoted. Revenue 
received from hydropower royalty and taxes on fossil fuels shall be used to promote rural 
electrification and alternative energy. 
 The framework of sector-wide approach of the current policy on rural energy shall be 
strengthened through a broad stakeholder involvement in the whole process of 
technology development to project identification, design and finally to implementation. 
Ministries and institutions related to rural development shall promote clean, reliable and 
appropriate energy sources as a means to reduce rural poverty and protect the 
environment. 
4.1.4 Biomass 
Biomass energy occupies a very important place in energy consumption of the country. As 
fuelwood is crucial to rural populace of the country for meeting their cooking as well as heating 
needs, the rate of exploitation of forest resources for fuelwood has gone beyond a sustainable 
level and is one of the causes of deforestation in the country. The pressure on the national 
forests on the one hand and the economic impact of rising import bills of oil in the economy on 
the other have left the policy choice extremely difficult. 
The policy will be to gradually decrease the share of traditional energy in the energy mix of the 
country and replace it by other renewable and alternative sources of energy. The increasing 
demand for energy in the short-to-medium term will need to be met by fuelwood as is the practice 
currently. Until the plantations for fuelwood start to mature or development of hydropower gets a 
momentum, the demand needs to be met by kerosene and LPG. This will increase the level of 
fossil fuels in the energy mix. In the long term, we need to move to an energy system heavily y g
utilized in a manner which gives priority to the basic needs of the people not only of fuelwood for 
cooking but also timber for housing, and fodder for domestic animals. Other areas for 
intervention are: 
 Promote technologies that improve efficiency of biomass use such as improved cookstoves. 
 Exploit the potential of developing 1.9 million biogas plants benefiting the same number of 
households out of 5 million households in the country. 
 Promote emerging biomass energy technologies such as briquettes, gasifiers, cogeneration 
and liquid biofuels. 
 Develop biomass energy through a decentralized implementation arrangements by 
establishing local support structures and integrating planning activities with local governments. 
 Exploit the potential of forestry sector policies and programmes to address poor people’s 
livelihoods and poverty reduction. 
 Exploit the potential of community forestry as a vehicle for social inclusion. 
 Fuelwood comes to the towns from the surrounding countryside. The sale of firewood often is 
the main or only source of cash income of women in particular. The commercial aspects of 
fuelwood represent a complex problem; we need to consider the entire chain of activities from 
producers, sellers to consumers. Strategies such as improved cookstoves will ease the 
demand for fuelwood and help conserve forests. Alternative livelihood strategies will be a 
necessary component of the policy in responding to the needs of people dependent on 
fuelwood trade. 
 Develop capacity to capture carbon credit benefits. The World Bank and the Asian 
Development Bank have technical assistance programmes to help member countries in 
capacity building to prepare proposals for availing the benefits. An increased forest coverage 
will also contribute to a GHG emission-free development and in the process qualify for REDD 
(Reducing Emission from Deforestation and Degradation) opportunities. 
 Energy demand for cooking and heating in the rural and semi-urban area shall be met by 
traditional biomass such as fuelwood. Community forest user groups, cooperatives, women 
user groups shall be encouraged and facilitated to grow tree plantations for fuelwood 
production through a system of long term lease. 
4.1.5 Fossil Fuels 
The thrust of the national strategy will be to gradually decrease the share of fossil fuels in the 
energy mix of the country and replace it by renewable sources of energy. The rising demand for 
energy in the short-to-medium term will be met by fossil fuels until the development of 
hydropower picks up. Development of indigenous and renewable source such as biofuels will be 
promoted to ease the pressure on imports for security considerations. 
Liquid biofuels can be extracted from plant seeds, and ethanol or methanol from forest products 
or sugarcane. Ethanol has been in use for several decades in countries such as Brazil and in 
recent years, it is increasing in south Asia as well. Biodiesel is made from vegetable oils, most 
commonly Jatropha curcas, animal fat or recycled greases. Biokerosene can be produced by 
distilling pine resin to produce turpentine, which can be used as a substitute of kerosene. 
The benefits of biofuels use should be well communicated to the public. It is less polluting than 
petroleum fuelsNew programmes to support development of farming and processing (bio-pp
The policy must support biofuel producers, retailers and users with tax concessions to shield 
them against the risks of trade restrictions. 
More research and exploration of mines should continue and more study and evaluation of the 
current deposits of coal should also be carried out. 
The policy principles include: 
 Import and distribution of oil shall be deregulated. Production of bio-diesel and ethanol and 
their use shall be promoted with appropriate fiscal and other incentives. 
 Research and Development (R&D) in the energy sector shall be supported with adequate 
resources. 
4.1.6 Institutional and Legal 
As electricity is the main source of modern energy and is one of the drivers for rapid economic 
growth and poverty alleviation, the country has set a target of adding 10,000 MW of capacity in 
the next ten years. Hence meeting the target of adding thousands of megawatt of power within a 
short period of time is a daunting task requiring expansion of the transmission and distribution 
networks. With each capacity addition, the issue of energy efficiency and conservation will need 
to attract more attention of the state. It requires the state to provide enabling institutional and 
legal frameworks as well as encourage competition with appropriate regulatory intervention. 
Currently allocation of responsibilities with regard to development and management of different 
sources of energy is spread over several ministries and agencies such as Ministry of Energy, 
Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology, Ministry of Forest and Soil Conservation, 
Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, Ministry of Commerce and Supplies, Ministry of 
Industry and local government bodies. The ministries are concerned with their own areas of 
operation and therefore policies are not always consistent and opportunities for inter-linkages 
and synergy are missing. Different fuels have different values in terms of efficiency and 
convenience. They generate different kinds and amounts of pollution. Their relative prices need 
to be set in a way that the resulting inter-fuel choices are socially and economically desirable. 
Pricing of one form of energy should not be set independently of each other. Integrated policy 
requires a consistent tax structure, a level playing field, uniform treatment of externalities, and 
consistent regulation. An integrated energy policy needs to clearly recognize the trade-offs in 
energy choices in an economy and optimize over the same in such a way that the end-uses for 
which energy is demanded are met in the most efficient and least cost manner. 
Specific options for institutional mechanisms include: 
 Constitute an apex body, the Energy Coordination Committee, under the chairmanship of the 
Prime Minister for policy decisions and coordination (The Government has already 
announced that the Prime Minister will oversee and coordinate development of10,000 MW 
capacity hydropower projects within the next ten years). This committee will review and 
approve policies for energy sector as a whole. Alternatively, this committee may be given a 
broader role of coordinating all water and energy sector policies. As more and more q, pyy p 
Prime Minister. All energy and water related ministers will be the members of this committee. 
This committee will ensure, among others, public sector autonomy to develop commercial 
culture (for example, public sector companies such as the NEA or the NOC must be 
managed by independent boards with no more than two government nominated Directors 
including just one from the incumbent Ministry). 
 Review and reallocate responsibilities of the Water and Energy Commission, and the 
National Planning Commission. 
 Reallocation of responsibilities with regard to rural energy sector under a single ministry, the 
MOEST instead of responsibilities spread or diffused over several agencies such as MOEST, 
DOED, and Rural Electrification Department under the NEA. 
 Create a separate Renewable Energy Development Agency or upgrade the current 
Alternative Energy Promotion Centre making it a purely professional body. 
A comprehensive legal framework will be required for the development and management of this 
resource. 
a. The draft legislation for the development and management of electricity needs to provide 
appropriate frameworks to implement the Hydropower Development Policy 2001. The 
planned large scale generation will attract a significant number of private investors for its 
development and in turn requires an independent and strong regulatory body. 
b. Enact a separate law for establishing an independent regulatory body. The energy sector 
requires regulatory oversight to balance consumer and producer interests, to ensure energy 
efficiency and to create a level playing field. Natural monopolies need regulation to ensure 
open access to all so that competitive efficiency is realized. 
c. Similar law needs to be enacted to regulate the supply, distribution and quality control of 
petroleum products and biofuels. 
d. The issues of energy efficiency and conservation will also require development of a 
separate legislation for setting standards and institutional framework for efficient use of 
energy and its conservation. 
e. Enact a separate law for regulation of petroleum products. Besides the supply and 
distribution aspects of petroleum products, the law should make mandatory provisions for 
developing, promoting and blending indigenous biofuels such as biodiesel and ethanol with 
incentives and tax concessions for biofuel producers, retailers and users. 
f. An enabling institutional framework is essential for integrated development of the energy 
sector. The institutional framework for development of other renewable and nonconventional energy sources has to be strengthened. 
g. The vertically integrated NEA should be restructured and unbundled to allow healthy 
competition and a level playing field for commercial operation of power sector. An 
independent regulatory authority should be created for a sound tariff setting enabling the 
power sector to operate in a commercial manner. 
h. An appropriate legal framework should be developed for an integrated policy formulation, 
development and coordination in the energy sector. Electricity is a critical infrastructure on which the socio-economic development of the country 
depends. Recognizing that electricity is one of the key drivers for rapid economic growth and 
poverty alleviation, the nation has set a target of producing 10,000 MW of power in ten years. 
The ERSF study shows that under the combined scenario of different policy measures, the peak 
installed capacity in 2030 will be over 11,480 MW. Development of hydropower of this size 
necessarily includes several reservoir projects. Harnessing of large reservoir projects in the 
Himalayas, however, represents one of the great challenges in international hydropower 
development. The use of water, the principles of allocation of usage rights and the guarantee of 
seasonal flows are all highly charged political issues. These issues need resolution before we 
embark upon a large scale development of hydropower in the country. 
The policy principles include: 
 Efforts should be made to forge regional cooperation and trade in energy in the region. 
Utilizing different peak times of neighboring countries, regional power trade will benefit the 
countries in the region. Since Nepal will have mostly ROR hydropower plants of which supply 
peaks in rainy season and decreases in dry season, regional power trade will be essential 
with exports in rainy season and imports in dry season. Regional power trading will help in 
optimal power investments in the country. 
 Even with the discouragement of imports of petroleum products, they occupy a sizable share 
in the future energy scenario. Intra-regional pipelines for imports of petroleum products will be 
needed for the efficient transport of them. New classification of energy sectors 
The current classification of energy resources is as shown in Figure 5.1. The energy resources 
are broadly classified into traditional, commercial and renewable. Traditional category consists of 
fuel-wood, animal dung and agricultural residue. Commercial consists of hydro, petroleum 
products and coal. Solar, biogas, wind, geothermal, micro-hydro and others are classified as 
renewable energy. 
Figure 44: Current Classification of Energy Resources in Nepal 
A new classification of energy resources is given in Figure 5.2. The energy resources are 
broadly classified as fossil fuels, renewable and nuclear energy. The fossil fuels category 
consists of petroleum products, natural gas and coal. Renewable energy is classified as 
conventional and new renewable. 
Biomass sub-sector is now categorized under conventional renewable. It is further subcategorized into traditional and modern biomass energy resources. Modern biomass consists of 
charcoal, briquette, bio-fuels such as biogas, ethanol, biodiesel etc. The new renewable subcategory consists of solar, wind, geothermal, hydrogen fuel, etc. Nuclear energy is separately 
classified considering the possibilities of development in future. 
In the fossil fuels sub-sector, petroleum products are further classified into petrol (gasoline), 
diesel, kerosene, aviation fuel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) etc. In the conventional renewable 
energy sub-sector, hydro renewable are further divided into large, medium, small, mini, micro 
and pico hydropower

OTHERS Strategies on Fossil Fuels Sub-sector 
Fossil fuels sub-sector includes petroleum, coal and natural gas. Major strategies and activities 
are explained below.
Strategy 1: Discourage use of fossil fuels by promoting alternative fuels in transport 
and machineries 
Transport sector is dependent on imported petroleum products. Further, the growth rate of 
energy consumption in transport sector is continuously increasing. The economics of oil imports 
shows the possibility of high expenditures of earnings from all commodities exports on importing 
fossil fuel. The policy intervention of introducing new transport technology such as fuel blending, 
electric and hybrid vehicles retards the growth rate of consumption of petroleum products and 
accelerates the utilization of renewable and indigenous resources. The identified activities and 
targets are: 
Short Term Targets and Activities (2010-2020) 
 Introduce Ethanol blended gasoline E10 (10 percent blended with ethanol) in all gasoline 
vehicles. 
 Introduce biodiesel B05 (5 percent blended with diesel) in all diesel vehicles. 
 Exempt tax in purchase of vehicles running on alternate fuels.

products Mid Term Targets 
 Reduce demand capacity of diesel and petrol cars by 10 percent of base case in 2020. 
Electric and Hybrid cars substituting this capacity by 5 percent each. 
Long Term Targets 
 Gradually increase ethanol percentage in gasoline from E10 to E20 (20 percent blended with 
ethanol). 
 Increase biodiesel percentage from B05 to B10 (10 percent blended with diesel). 
 Gradually replace 20 percent and 30 percent demand capacity of diesel and petrol cars of the 
base case in year 2025 and 2030 with electric and hybrid vehicle in equal share. 
Strategy 2: Ensure sufficient storage facilities of petroleum products. 
The current storage facility of Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC) is adequate to meet the daily demand 
for 20 days, which is less that the IEA norm of mandatory storage requirement of accommodating 
90 days’ daily demands. Following activities are identified under this strategy. 
Short Term Targets and Activities (2010-2015) 
 Upgrade petroleum oil storage facility by 45 days of daily demand. 
 Upgrade LPG storage facility by 45 days. 
 Involve the private sectors in purchase, storage and distribution of the petroleum products 
Mid Term and Long Term Targets (2015-2030) 
 Upgrade oil storage facility of petroleum oil by 90 days of daily demand. 
Strategy 3: Promote and facilitate the petroleum and the natural gas exploration 
The Government of Nepal has identified certain Blocks in Dhangadi, Karnali, Lumbini, Birgunj, 
and Malangawa as the potential sites for Petroleum exploration. Further, some areas in 
Kathmandu valley are identified as the potential areas for natural gas. However, exploration 
works are yet to be initiated. The exploration work will confirm the availability of natural gas as 
well as petroleum both in terms of quality and quantity. The following activities are indentified: 
Short Term Activities (2010-2015) 
 Explore and promote the natural gas reserved in Kathmandu. 
 Create conducive environment for exploration work. 
Mid Term Activities (2015-2020) 
 Create favorable policy and rules to encourage the national and international companies for 
exploration of petroleum products. 
 Provide financial and technical support to conduct feasibility study. Coal deposits are found in the Western parts of Nepal near Dang and adjoining districts. Noncommercialized production of coal is being carried out and supplied to the market. The physical 
quantities explored are about 2.5 percent of the coal imports. Exploration of coal deposits shall 
be promoted. Commercial production of coal shall be initiated in case of commercially feasible. 
Strategy 5: Enforce energy efficiency programme 
Large amount of energy can be saved in industries and commercial complexes through energy 
efficiency intervention. Energy audit is therefore necessary to understand the energy 
conservation potential in the sectors. This activity will help in reducing load shedding hours as 
well as provide lead time for arranging new capacity additions. The activities identified are given 
below: 
Short Term Activities (2010-2015) 
 Prepare energy auditing manual /energy conservation manual. 
 Perform energy auditing of 50% of registered industries. 
Long Term Targets and Activities (2015-2030) 
 Perform energy auditing of all registered industries. 
 Develop energy conservation regulatory framework. 
Strategies on Renewable Energy Sector 
5.3.1 Hydropower Sub-sector
Hydropower is the indigenous and clean energy resource. The major strategies developed in this 
sector are explained below: 
Strategy 6: Develop hydro-power as prioritized energy resource 
The strategy aims at gradually increasing the share of hydropower in the energy mix by 
substituting traditional fuels such as fuel woods, dung as well as petroleum fuels such as 
kerosene, Diesel, LPG etc. The following activities are identified. 
Short Term Activities (2010-2015) 
 Prepare a long-term plan for each river basin with the aim of achieving maximum benefit to 
the government. 
 Draft concrete plans to identify the potential projects. 
 Develop hydropower plants in the pipeline under fast track process. 
 Prioritize small and mini-micro hydropower plants that can be immediately developed through 
internal resources. 
Medium Term Activities and Long Term Activities (2010-2030) 
 Develop hydropower projects of multi-purpose nature. 
 Develop mini grid system in remote and isolated areasPromotion of alternative energy for transport sector is crucial to ease the increasing import of 
petroleum. From the analysis of new transport technology assumptions in energy model, 
promoting electric and hybrid vehicle along with ethanol and biodiesel saves petroleum 
consumption by 1 percent in 2015 and 4 percent in 2030. 
Following activities are identified for promoting electrical and fuel efficient transport.
Short Term Targets and Activities (2010-2015) 
 Facilitate imports of hybrid and electric cars by 5 percent. 
 Ensure continuous supply of electricity to the electrical vehicle recharge stations. 
 Provide rebates in the customs duty of hybrid/electric vehicles as much as 50% and 25% on 
the prevailing customs duty on conventional vehicles. 
 Research on the probability of electric trains and ropeways (both electric and mechanical). 
Mid Term Targets /Activities (2015-2020) 
 Facilitate imports of hybrid and electric cars by 10 percent. 
Long Term Activities (2020-2030) 
 Facilitate imports of hybrid and electric cars by 15 percent. 
 Upon sufficient generation of hydropower and reliable transmission, planning electric trains 
along the East – West Highways can be considered. 
Strategy 8: Plan national/regional/local transmission lines at the very beginning of 
hydro-power project/plan formulation stage 
Identify and install the high voltage cross-border and domestic transmission lines of different 
capacities in close coordination with the electricity generation centers to evacuate the electricity 
being generated at present and planned for future. Prepare Transmission Line Master Plan for 
effective implementation. 
Strategy 9: Develop mechanisms to minimize prevailing transmission and distribution 
loss, and also reduce electricity misuse. 
Develop and implement a plan with annual milestones to bring down transmission and 
distribution losses through community participation, effective enforcement and incentives to 
consumers. There is a strong need for bringing down the transmission and distribution losses to 
10/12 percent, a benchmark which needs to be achieved for reliable and efficient operations of 
the transmission and distribution systems. 
Strategy 10: Implement Demand Side Management Tools in energy consuming sectors 
From energy model it can be observed that, upon implementing energy efficient lights 
intervention program, there is a decrease in power plant requirement of 5 percent and 9 percent 
in 2015 and in 2030 respectively. Besides, replacing incandescent lamps with energy efficient 
lights and/or electric choke, demand side management program also includes promotion of 
energy efficient enduse devicesThe following activities are identified for demand side  Aware general public to use the less electrical energy consuming electrical appliances. 
 Encourage the industrialists to enhance the capacity of transformers by increasing power 
factors through installing capacitors in the systems. 
Mid Term Targets and Activities (2015-2020) 
 Replace 50 percent of incandescent bulbs with Energy efficient lights in residential and 
service sectors. 
Long Term Targets and Activities 
 Replace 70 percent of incandescent bulbs with energy efficient lights in residential and 
service sectors. 
 Operate existing transmission lines in full capacity 
 Construct new transmission lines in order to minimize the prevailing technical losses. 
5.3.2 Renewable Biomass
Strategy 11: Discourage the use of traditional energy in all energy sectors. 
The reference case scenario of the integrated energy model indicated the dominance of fuel 
wood, exceeding the sustainable limit throughout the analysis period. The policy intervention of 
introducing more efficient energy sources in the energy ladder will maintain the fuel wood 
consumption within sustainable limits by 2025. Further, though, fuel wood and other low quality 
energy sources are cheap and readily available, it creates negative impacts on environment and 
health. Hence, following activities are identified for switching towards high quality energy 
sources. 
Short Term Targets and Activities (2010-2015): 
 Replace 20 percent of the traditional and fossil fuels consumption by electricity in industrial 
and commercial sectors as compared to the share of base year. 
 Replace 10 percent and 50 percent of fuel wood share of the base year by electricity, 
kerosene and/or LPG in residential urban and residential rural sector respectively. 
 Develop strong monitoring mechanism for auditing to address CDM. 
 Develop a Mechanism for interlinking the RE Database system. 
 Agriculture and solid waste should be integrated for energy generation. 
 Developing fuel efficient stoves and briquettes. 
 Discourage converting forest land for other development purpose. 
 Adopt sector wide approach (SWAP) for RE development. 
 Prepare appropriate legislation for RE (MHP, Solar Wind) grid connection. 
Mid Term / Long Term Targets and Activities (2015-2030)
 Replace 30 percent of the traditional and fossil fuels consumption of the share in base year 
by electricity in industrial and commercial sectors. 
 Replace 30 percent and 75 percent of fuel wood share of the base year by electricity, 
kerosene and/or LPG in residential urban and residential rural sector respectively. Large amount of energy demand is fulfilled by traditional energy at the base year. Mostly, these 
sources are used inefficiently. Hence, simple efficiency improvement technology like ICS can 
drastically reduce the consumption of the biomass. This will not only reduce the gap of 
sustainable supply and consumption of biomass but also reduce the environmental and health 
hazards. 
Mid Term Activities (2010-2015)
 Start programs of switching 25 percent of traditional cookstove to ICS. 
Mid Term and Long Term Activities (2015-2030)
 Replace 50 percent of traditional cooking stoves by ICS. 
Also, continuously study, develop and disseminate emerging biomass energy technologies such 
as briquettes, gasifiers, co-generation and liquid bio-fuels. 
Strategy 13: Establish a mechanism for ensuring sustained supply of biomass materials 
for energy by incorporating biomass production as one of the many objectives of the 
resource management in agriculture, forest and livestock sectors. 
This strategy includes promoting the production of all possible forms of biomass energy sources 
from agriculture, forest and livestock sectors as one of the objectives of the resource 
management in respective sectors, and the use of efficient and clean combustion devices. This 
integrated approach in fact improves the feasibility of those sectors. 
Strategy 14: Establish and institutionalize mechanisms to share experience and have 
regular interaction among relevant stakeholder at national and regional levels. 
Develop biomass energy through a decentralized implementation arrangements by establishing 
local support structures and integrating planning activities with local governments. The potential 
of community forestry as a vehicle for social inclusion should be exploited. 
Strategy 15: Disseminate information on modern bio-energy technology. 
Awareness Campaign on new bio-energy technology and its advantages in economy, 
environment and health among the rural population should be initiated. 
Strategy 16: Identify and make use of the opportunities of carbon trading under the Clean 
Development Mechanism (CDM) and the new mechanism under development that is 
referred as Reduction of Emission from Deforestation in Developing countries (REDD) 
The activities on capacity building, developing human resource, programs and assistance to the 
concerned parties in realization of benefits from the CDM and new mechanism of REDD shall be 
initiated. 
5.3.3 New Renewable Energy
Strategy 17: Promote the use of alternative or renewable energy thereby reducing gqg
Hence, alternative energy technologies can substitute such energy resources for the betterment 
of environment and economic condition. Preparing the Master Plan for the alternative energy 
development shall be instrumental in planned development of such technologies. 
Solar Energy: 
 Adopt solar PV for rural electrification and promote its use in urban power supply. 
 Enforce use of SHS in all star hotels by 2015. 
 Standardize and control the quality the technologies. 
Wind Energy:
 Perform wind mapping of the potential sites. 
 Prepare wind energy policy. 
 Conduct pilot projects for capacity building of national experts. 
Other RETs: 
 Develop and promote advanced RETs (such as hydrogen, nuclear, geothermal, etc.) in 
future. 
Energy Pricing and Deregulation of Energy Sector 
Strategy 18: Promote private investors in hydropower projects. 
Public sector utilities like NEA should make prompt offers to sign PPA at a standard wet and dry 
season rates with a provision of price escalation. Offering fiscal and financial incentives including 
loans for development of power projects will attract private investors. If payment of subsidy is 
involved as incentive, arrangement for a system should be made where payment is made after 
the project is operational. 
Strategy 19: Establish differential electricity tariff. 
Differential tariffs for electricity would result to a more uniform load curve of electricity grid. This 
would mean greater plant load factor and reduction of generation cost. 
Strategy 20: Establish free competitive market in petroleum products. 
A competitive market involving private sector shall be instrumental in addressing the irregular 
supply of petroleum products. Petroleum pricing is still controlled by the government. An 
automatic pricing mechanism has to be implemented to reflect the market fluctuations in the 
domestic prices of the petroleum products for secured supply of the petroleum products. 
Strategy 21: Ensure targeted subsidy mechanism for alternative energy resources and on 
energy efficient end-use devices. 
The rural poor have to depend on kerosene for lighting and there are new alternate energy 
technologies such as solar tuki and other renewable technologies available for meeting energy gp
Social Aspect 
Strategy 22: Maintain equity in electricity access in urban and rural areas. 
Reduce the current disparity in electricity access between urban and rural areas. Rural 
electrification can be done by alternate sources such as micro/pico hydro, solar and wind, where 
grid connection is not feasible. 
Strategy 23: Establish mechanism for equitable benefit distribution. 
The benefits of cleaner energy services must be equitably distributed. This can be achieved by 
implementing special programs for remote areas and providing subsidies where needed. 
Strategy 24: Empower weak socio-economic group. 
Social inclusion is a key to achieving developmental goals. The focus must be established on 
addressing empowerment, energy access and security of women, socially excluded as well as 
those living below the poverty line. 
Strategy 25: Promote awareness, education and training related to energy sources 
Awareness of the available options of energy resources and its benefits is essential for effective 
use. Various outreach as well as training programs regarding energy alternatives must be carried 
out throughout the nation. 
Strategy 26: Ensure each institution will have at least one type of RETs by short term and 
two types by long term period. 
To promote RETs, each government institutions must use one type of RETs by short term and 
two types by long term period. 
Environmental Aspect 
Strategy 27: Reduce air pollution 
Many rural women and children suffer from various diseases due to exposure to indoor air 
pollution produced from burning of fuel wood and agricultural wastes using inefficient cooking 
stoves. Hence to reduce the pollution following activities must be initiated: 
 Initiate large scale awareness program on the negative impact of indoor air pollution caused 
by burning fuel wood in traditional stoves to all rural people so that they can look for 
alternative cooking stoves. 
 Promote improved cooking stove with chimney at affordable price to replace the existing 
inefficient traditional stoves. 
 Research and development activities related to various kinds of improved cooking stoves 
hld biititd tidhid ibilittthkidf ttdgy 
pollution but also lessen the fuel consumption. 
Besides, in urban areas, air pollution due to vehicular emission is significant. Hence 
 Strictly enforce vehicular emission standards. 
 Encourage Public transport and electric vehicle in urban areas. 
Strategy 28: Minimize environmental degradation 
Since fuelwood is used as fuel for cooking in rural areas, the trees are cut in unsustainable 
manner to meet the daily requirement. The requirement of higher quantity of fuelwood in 
inefficient traditional stoves is another factor which leads to overexploitation of forest. Following 
activities are identified to reduce the impacts. 
 Conduct awareness programs to the user groups on the use of traditional energy resources, 
environmental degradation and impact on climate change due to excessive use of biomass in 
inefficient traditional stoves. 
 After introducing and providing improved cooking stoves accessible, local government can fix 
penalty to those users who do not use efficient stoves. At the same time, the government 
should provide the provision of loan, to user group for purchasing the efficient stoves. 
 Provide incentives to the community who look after the community base forest. 
Promote electrical cooking in the areas where access to the electricity is available. 
Strategy 29: Minimize loss of wildlife and biodiversity 
The excessive use of biomass from the forest will cause the loss of wildlife and biodiversity in 
course of time. Provide attractive incentives to those user groups who preserve the forest and 
conserve biomass energy through the use of efficient stoves and switching to different types of 
fuels. 
Strategy 30: Introduce pollution tax on fossil fuels with the provision for alternative 
renewable energy sources 
People should be made aware about the negative impact of air pollution caused by excessive 
use of fossil fuels. Hence, following activities are identified for initiation: 
 Increase the fuel price. This will limit the use of vehicles as per need. 
 Initiate the import of less polluting vehicles like hybrid vehicles and electrical vehicles. 
 Provide incentives to electrical and hybrid vehicles. 
 Make vehicle emission standard stringent and monitored accordingly at the same time by 
fixing high penalty to those vehicles that do not meet the set emission standards. 
 Tighten air pollution standards such that users of coal and solid fuels will install efficient and 
pollution friendly devices in their industries. 
 Provide incentives to those industries that meet the air pollution standard and fix high penalty 
to those who do not. Hydropower is the lead energy source. Every projects undergo EIA or IEE. The EIA Process 
requires procedural simplification for approval so that the projects can be implemented on time. 
 Differentiate the time frame for EIA for small, medium and big hydro power plants. 
 Simplify the time frame for EIA for small hydro power plants. 
Strategy 32: Introduce battery disposal rules and regulation 
Every year quite a large number of solar home systems are installed in the rural areas where the 
national grid or micro-hydro power plants are not available. Solar home system has provided 
very useful services to rural people. As the number of solar home system increases so do the 
number of lead acid batteries. Till now there are no rules and regulation for the disposal of these 
batteries as well as batteries from motor vehicles, which is going to be a great nuisance in rural 
environment. Hence following activities are proposed: 
 Conduct awareness to the user group about the impact of improper disposal of these 
batteries. 
 Formulate the rules and regulation regarding the disposal of batteries of SHS and implement 
it properly. 
 Establish battery collection centers in the community and provision should be made for 
sending these batteries for recycling. 
 Provide incentives to battery recycling industries. 
Strategy 33: Disseminate solid waste management technologies to public 
Use of biogas reduce significant amount of fuel wood consumption and improve the indoor air 
pollution in the kitchen. Biogas can be generated using dung as well as any kind of 
biodegradable solid waste as a feed material. Further, attaching toilets to the bio-gas plants not 
generates bio-gas but also improves household sanitation. Despite the effort to expand the 
coverage of biogas plants, very poor families are still not been able to afford. The following 
activities are identified to disseminate biogas technology to expand the coverage: 
 Construct Pilot project to generate cooking gas from solid wastes from disposal of agricultural 
residues, municipal and industrial residues. 
 Encourage people to build such plants by providing attractive incentives. 
Institutional and Capacity Development 
Institutional
Strategy 34: Develop Integrated Energy Planning (IEP). 
An integrated plan, encompassing all aspects of energy sector, is required to establish priorities 
and allocate resources for development to deliver service to people at least cost. Following 
activities are recommended for IEP development: 
 Constitute an apex body, the Energy Coordination Council, under the chairmanship of the 
Prime Minister for policy decisions and coordination. Political consensus should be built and 
strictly adhered to by all political parties including their allied functionaries on hydropower , , ) g pgy 
 As more and more candidate hydropower projects come for review, the conflicts in water use 
are bound to increase which needs resolution at the local as well as central level. The Water 
and Energy Commission and its Secretariat will review the projects for integration. 
 At local level, formulate and implement integrated energy development programmes by the 
DDCs, VDCs and municipalities as per the needs, availability of the local resources and 
national priority level. 
 Encourage participation of locally active organization during formulation and execution of 
such plans. 
 Develop a mechanism for interlinking the integrated energy database system at the central 
level at WECS with operational databases at various line operational agencies such as NEA, 
NOC, and AEPC etc. 
Strategy 35: Review integrated energy strategy periodically in line with national economic 
development plans 
Strategy development is a dynamic process and hence, needs periodic review in line with the 
national economic plans, changes in other public policies, social, and environmental events. 
Strategy 36: Develop subsectoral strategies and action plans in accordance with the 
integrated energy strategies and action plans 
In order to have coherence and proper coordination, subsectoral strategies (e.g., Energy 
Efficiency Strategy and Biomass Energy Strategy) and action plans are required to be developed 
in accordance with the integrated energy strategies and action plans. These plans and strategy 
shall be reviewed periodically. 
Strategy 37: Review and reallocate responsibilities of the Water and Energy Commission, 
and the National Planning Commission. 
There are conflicts and overlapping of responsibilities of WECs and NPC. Hence it must be 
reviewed with clear responsibilities considering the current situation and development of different 
sectors in the country. A separate act should be promulgated for WECS and it should be 
strengthened with adequate authority and jurisdiction. 
Strategy 38: Reallocate responsibilities with regard to rural energy sector. 
Reallocate responsibilities with regard to rural energy sector under a single ministry, the MOE, 
instead of responsibilities spread or diffused over several agencies such as MOEST, DOED, and 
Rural Electrification Department under the NEA. 
Strategy 39: Establish an independent regulatory body. 
The energy sector requires regulatory oversight to balance consumer and producer interests, to 
ensure efficiency and to create a level playing field. Natural monopolies need regulation to 
ensure open access to all so that competitive efficiency is realized. Identified activities in these 
context are: 
 Establish an independent regulatory body for the marketing of petroleum products for 
domestic price fixation of petroleum products on the basis of the international pricesfor g 
 Establish an independent laboratory to check the quality of the petroleum products distributed 
and if needed establish in different development regions as well. 
Strategy 40: Ensure level playing field for all types of stakeholders. 
To ensure level playing field for all stakeholders in energy sector, eliminate monopoly in: 
 Hydropower projects to be identified & prioritized (optimized in the respective basins/subbasins) by GoN and licenses awarded through competitive bidding. 
 Hydropower transmission and distribution, 
 Fuelwood generation and harvesting and 
 Import, storage and distribution of petroleum products. 
Detailed strategic options in the institutional aspect are explained in the Annex table. 
Legal
Strategy 41: Amend Electricity Act and laws to provide state incentives in income taxes, 
VAT and etc. in hydropower development. 
Following issues shall be consider while amending Electricity Act and Nepal Electricity 
Regulatory Commission Act. 
 Hydropower as a priority sector. 
 Provide Tax holidays to energy infrastructure projects such as hydropower. Fiscal incentives 
and concessions should be provided through financial enactments administered by MoF. 
 Ownership of the water resources should be vested in the center while the “user right” could 
be allocated amongst various states (provinces), basin authorities and/or local bodies. 
 Involuntary resettlement, property acquisition, compensation and community development 
depending upon the size and type of hydropower plant. 
 Sharing of revenue from hydropower plants between various levels of government. 
 Type and mode of people’s participation in the benefit sharing from hydropower plants on the 
basis of plant size and type. 
Strategy 42: Enact laws and regulations to enforce unbundling in the electricity subsector. 
Unbundle electricity utility into separate entities for generation, transmission and distribution. This 
will make private investments possible in sectors other than generation. 
Strategy 43: Enact separate law for deregulation of petroleum products. 
Besides the supply and distribution aspects of petroleum products, the law should make 
mandatory provisions for developing, promoting and blending indigenous biofuels such as 
biodiesel and ethanol with incentives and tax concessions for biofuel producers, retailers and 
users. 
Strategy 44: Develop laws and regulations to focus on reducing deforestation, indoor air 
pollution and reducing GHG emissions. , ppg
Strategy 45: Develop an Integrated Energy Policy 
There exists some separate subsectoral policies and some are being formulated. however, an 
integrated policy addressing all forms of energy is yet to be formulated. There is a need to 
prepare Integrated Energy Policy. 
Strategy on Nuclear Energy 
Strategy 46: Assess the Nuclear Energy Production Potential 
Nuclear energy is considered as one of the cleaner energy and many countries are developing 
such technology for peaceful purposes. It may be one of the vital sources of energy for the near 
future. Assessing the potentiality of nuclear energy production considering locational, 
geophysical, technical, economical and socio economic aspects may be helpful for future. Energy Mix on the National Economy 
Energy systems modeling framework, investment requirements for two types of energy mix - (a) 
reference case, and (b) all combined policy interventions at Reference Case - have been 
estimated and presented in the Table 6.1

Reference Scenario)

2025-2030 575,147 907,302 
 Source: Estimates 
Energy requirement and its mix have been identified based on the predicted GDP growth rate 
based on the reference case (Interim plan scenario). Investment requirements for getting 
required energy mixes have also been determined. The Table 6.2 shows the investment 
requirement as the percentage of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF). The combined case 
with all the policy interventions with 5.6 percent GDP growth rates will need 14 percent of GFCF 
whereas, the reference case needs only 9.3 percent in the period (2025-2030). It was about 6 
percent of the GFCF in the period (2001-2005). However, the investment requirement can be 
met using the faster rising growth rate of remittances sent by the Nepalese laborers from outside 
the country by discouraging its non-productive use and adopting the appropriate policy with 
incentive package. This can be done by encouraging private sector to invest in the production of 
energy. This will relax the reliance on foreign sources of financing.

Now it is also essential to assess the effect of reference case and its investment requirement for 
the energy sector on the national economy. Average annual growth rate of the Value Added in 
the electricity, gas and water sub sector in reference case is estimated 6.8 percent following the 
existing energy mix. It will be 11.6 percent in case of adopting the combined optimal energy mix 
with demand management. It is natural that more investment in the sub sector leads to the higher 
average annual growth rate of the sub sector. Besides, the increase in sub sector investment will 
have naturally positive impact on the GDP growth rates. That has been explained in the 
following Table 6.3.

Macroeconomic implications of the investment in energy sector on the national economy: 
 Based on Reference Growth Scenario estimate, the shares of sectoral investment in total 
GFCF in the period (2025-2030) in the reference case and combined optimal energy mix with 
demand management are 9.3 percent and 14 percent respectively, whereas it was only 6.1 
percent in the period (2001-2005). Intervention in energy mix demands more investment on 
the sub-sector. 
 Estimated annual growth rates of sectoral value added in reference case and combined case 
with demand management in the reference scenario are: 6.8 percent and 11.6 percent 
respectively. 
 Estimated annual growth rates of GDPPP with existing energy mix and combined optimal 
energy mix with demand management based on the reference scenario are: 5.6 percent and 
5.8 percent respectively. 
Thus, the proposed investment in energy sector will have desired macroeconomic implications 
on the national economy along with increasing domestic resource mobilization, making private 
sector more active in this sector and attracting remittances earned from abroad towards this 
sector. Reduction 
 Introduction 
Climate change and disaster risk reduction are closely related. More extreme weather events in 
future are likely to increase the number and scale of disaster. But the existing methods and tools of 
disaster risk reduction provide powerful capacities for adaptation to climate change. Climate change 
means the alteration of world’s climate caused by human activities through fossil fuel burning, 
deforestation and other practices that increase the concentration of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the 
atmosphere. On the other hand, disaster risk reduction is defined as “action taken to reduce the risk 
of disasters and the adverse impacts of natural hazards, through systematic efforts to analyze and 
manage the cause of disasters, including through avoidance of hazards, reduced social and 
economic vulnerability to hazards, and improved preparedness for adverse events” 
(http://www.unisdr.org). 
A recent study (UNDP, 2004) ranked Nepal, in terms of relative vulnerability to earthquakes, as the 
eleventh most at risk country in the world, and thirtieth with respect to floods. Another report (World 
Bank, 2005) classifies Nepal as one of the global ‘hot-spots’ for natural disasters. Among the major 
hazards, floods and landslides are the most recurrent in Nepal, claiming on an average of about 211 
lives annually in the past ten years. There are 3,252 glaciers and 2,323 lakes at or above 3,500 
metres above sea level in Nepal. Twenty glacier lakes are at risk of bursting due to melting glaciers, 
according to a 2002 report by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development 
(ICIMOD) and the UN Environment Programme. Area covered by these glaciers is 5,324 sq.km. and 
total ice reserve is 480.48 cu.km. Every summer a part of snow melts and adds up in the next 
winter. This way the ice is recycled. Glacial lakes created by melting glaciers can overflow, releasing 
several thousand cubic meters of water per second along stream channels. Several floods down 
stream due to increase in water volume of many rivers have been observed. Such flooding will not 
only cause threat to villages but also many hydro power plants causing damage to national property. 
Evidence of climate change 
There are many observations increasing air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow 
and ice, and rising sea level. Over the last 100 years (1906–2005), global temperature has 
increased by 0.74°C. Global sea level has risen by 17 cm during the 20th century, in part because 
of the melting of snow and ice from many mountains and in the Polar Regions. More regional 
changes have also been observed, including changes in Arctic temperatures and ice, ocean salinity, 
wind patterns, droughts, precipitations, frequency of heat waves and intensity of tropical cyclones. 
The temperature differences are most pronounced during the dry winter season and least during 
the height of monsoon in Nepal. The warming is significantly greater at higher elevations, i.e., 
mountainous region, in the northern part of the country than at lower elevations, i.e. Terai in the 
south. The average temperature has risen by 1.5°C from 21.6°C of 1978 - 81 to 23.1°C for 2001- 
06. Rainfall shows irregular pattern. Hence, increasing or decreasing trends cannot be confirmed. 
However, annual rainfall data shows larger values than before. On the other hand, there is less 
rainfall during winter and spring and intense rainfall during rainy season. This may cause erratic Increase in the concentration of GHG in the atmosphere is the main culprit of climate change in 
Earth surface. With the industrial development the developed as well as developing countries are 
consuming a significant quantity of fossil fuels. The burning of fossil fuel and cutting of trees will add 
excess amount of GHG in the atmosphere. These GHG act as a “blanket” which traps the incoming 
solar energy and keeps the earth surface warmer than it otherwise would. The more the GHG in the 
atmosphere the warmer will be the earth surface causing severe climate change. 
Impacts 
Nepal is already highly vulnerable to water- induced disaster such as floods, landslides, slope 
failures and debris flow. The recent trends in climate and climate change have further aggravated 
this scenario, particularly in regards to hydropower development. 
The continued melting of glaciers in the Himalayan region is projected to increase flooding and rock 
avalanches and to adversely affect water resources in the coming years. It is experiencing increase 
in dry periods, intense rainfall, floods, landslides, forest fires, glacial retreats and 
Glacier Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) threats. The Himalayan glaciers are the sources of freshwater 
reserves which provide headwater for major river system flowing through Nepal. The Himalayan 
glaciers are shrinking more rapidly than elsewhere. This will make rivers seasonal in future. As 
glaciers melt, river runoff will initially increase in winter or spring but will eventually decrease as a 
result of loss of ice resources. This is going to be unfavourable for downstream run-of-river 
hydropower plants along with other uses of water like irrigation and drinking water supplies. Most of 
the hydropower plants in Nepal are and would be run-of-the river (ROR) type and hence, firm power 
outputs from these plants will decrease eventually. 
Thus the impacts of climate change will be less water in perennial rivers in winter (water resources), 
decrease in winter and spring crop production (agriculture), change and extinction of some species 
and habitats (forest and biodiversity) and flooding related disasters due to glacier melting and 
spreading of diseases like malaria, asthma etc. (health). The intensity of impact will be higher to 
poor, young and old people. 
GHG Emission Reduction from Energy Strategies 
The MARKAL modelling framework can show the relationship among economy, energy and 
environmental activities. For instance, the green-house-gas emission (GHG) in CO2–equivalent from 
the combined energy activities can be envisaged and compared for the subsequent emission 
impact. Hereunder, two scenarios are observed and compared between the reference case with 5.6 
percent GDP growth and the combined case with all the policy measures with the same 5.6 percent 
GDP growth rate.

case from 56.67 million tones to 26.6 million tonnes if all the policy measures as mentioned above 0.00

Combined Policy
By implementing the combined policy measures GHG emissions can be reduced by 30 million tons 
and this reduction can be used for carbon trading through CDM. 
Besides, adverse impacts of climate change can be mitigated by taking proactive policy measures in 
time and thus disaster risk can be reduced for a sustainable development of the country. ADB, 2003. Country Economic Review: Nepal, Asian Development Bank, Manila, Philippines
