I. SUMMARY 
A. Introduction
1. Household energy accounts for by far the largest consumption of energy in Myanmar due to the 
large rural population and the daily cooking cycle. Cooking relies on woody biomass as the most 
important national energy source. In 2013, cooking demand met by biomass sources— firewood, 
charcoal, agricultural waste, wood waste, and animal dung—amounted to around 72% of total final 
energy consumed. 
Figure I-1: Cooking Fuels: 2013-14
 Sources: Consultant
2. In Yangon and urban Mandalay commercial fuels are in use for cooking; electricity, LPGas and 
charcoal are in common use. Outside of these urban areas, traditional fuels are mainly used along 
with electricity where it is available. 
3. Rural household lighting accounts for a relatively low consumption of the total household 
energy consumption at less than 1%. Energy used for household cooking dominates household 
energy consumption. The demand for lighting services is met by on-grid and off-grid sources—by 
candles, wick lamps, fluorescent bulbs, LED / battery lighting systems, and solar lighting systems. 
Households without access to electricity, and those with the lowest incomes, rely mainly on candles,
oil wick lamps and LED DC lighting.414

4. The use of non-commercial fuels in the villages occurs because rural villagers have a very low 
and sporadic cash income and this poses two problems:-
(i) It limits their fuel options
Poor villagers are able to buy only small amounts of fuel when money is available to do so. This 
means that fuels that can be purchased in small amounts at low cost will be most viable. It also 
means that the cheapest fuel will usually be sought, regardless of the harmful health effects 
that come with the burning of woody biomass.
(ii) There is a limited expendable income to buy appliances
Energy using appliances often require significant capital outlay relative to the household 
income. A particular consequence is that if electricity or LPGas becomes available, many
households will not be able to use these fuels for cooking because of a lack of electrical 
appliances.
5. Compared to wealthier, electrified households, low income households (mainly rural but also 
many peri-urban) suffer high levels of harmful emissions by burning wood, woody biomass, charcoal, 
diesel oil and paraffin. Emissions from these fuels are highly concentrated and slow moving. The use 
of open fires in the household can also be the cause of accidents that result in injury or death. 
Electricity and gas are relatively cleans fuel for households, notwithstanding that gas is more 
hazardous than electricity. 
6. Long-term planning requires an accurate depiction of the current household demand for energy 
on which to base projections of future demand. The EMP household survey, conducted throughout 
2014, has provided household end-use data suitable for establishing baseline energy use in 2014. 
7. An important planning issue is the potential for fuel substitution over the long-term. The ADB 415
supports a 100% rural electrification program and household energy demand has been projected with 
the programme in mind. In the case of cooking, electricity access would provide an opportunity for the 
use of rice cookers. In the case of lighting, electricity access would allow households to switch from 
candles, diesel oil lamps and battery lighting to electric lights. Care has been taken to ensure that the 
household electricity use projected in this household sector report, is fully consistent with the
State/Region ‘top-down’ electricity forecasts developed from historical electricity sales data. 
B. Household Sector Final Energy Consumption Forecasts
8. The EMP household survey has revealed that the patterns of fuel use for cooking divide into a 
‘Yangon Division / urban Mandalay’ and ‘Other’ segmentation. For consistency the same 
segmentation has been used for lighting, TV/entertainment and other energy consumption (cooling 
services). These segments are hereafter referred to as the ‘Urban’ and ‘Rural’ segments. 
9. The household sector energy projections are provided as Figure I-3 . The details are given in 
Table I-4.

10. Figure I-5 and Figure I-6 provide separate views of final energy consumption for Urban 
households and Rural households respectively. Table I-7 provides the final energy consumption for 
electricity only. Table I-8 provides the final energy consumption on a toe per household basis. The 
toe per capita estimates are consistent with international benchmarks. Figure I-9 to Figure I-15
provide the projections of household fuel carrier consumption (in physical terms).416

II. PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS 
C. EMP HH Survey
11. The data concerning household energy use for cooking and heating water has been sparse 
until recent years. MercyCorps has undertaken surveys of rural households that provide insights into 
the patterns of energy use for household cooking, water heating and lighting. The focus of the 
MercyCorps studies was on the use and barriers to the introduction of fuel efficient stoves (FES). A 
survey of food security was conducted in 2012 by the Livelihoods for Food Security Trust (LIFT). The 
survey covered 4,000 rural households in poverty-stricken areas and captured high level information 
concerning fuel use for cooking by fuel zone and by income decile. 
12. Whilst previous surveys provide a useful starting point for energy planning, the LIFT survey did 
not extend to end-use patterns or urban households, and so a household survey was designed and 
conducted under the aegis of the Energy Masterplan. The design of the EMP household survey was 
shaped by the insights gained from the LIFT survey but has specifically tackled the question of 
household end-use.
13. The EMP HH survey revealed that the fuels used for cooking are predominantly commercial 
fuels in the Yangon Division and the urban area of Mandalay. Outside of these areas, cooking fuel use 
was found to be fairly uniform and predominantly fuel wood. Fuel wood includes fire wood and woody 
biomass in the form of agricultural waste used mainly as a supplementary fuel. On a dry weight basis, 
agricultural waste accounts for around 7% of the wood fuel used for cooking by rural households.
These fuel use patterns are revealed by ‘fuel heatmaps’ developed from the HH survey data:-423

14. The heat maps provide a striking illustration of the difference between the cooking habits of 
Yangon and urban Mandalay residents and residents elsewhere in Myanmar. The colours represent a 
different cooking technology / fuel and from the difference in colours it can be seen that there is a vast 
difference between urban and rural cooking habits. It is apparent from Figure II-1 that electricity, 
LPGas and charcoal are the dominant fuels in the Yangon Division where households are relatively 
affluent and commercial fuels are available. Moveover, Figure II-2 shows that electricity, LPGas and 
charcoal are also the dominant fuels in urban Mandalay. Outside of urban Mandalay the pattern of 
end-use is fairly homogenous; open fires were found to be the most common means used for cooking.
These patterns of fuel use for cooking mean that it is logical to segment fuel estimates for cooking 
according to a ‘Yangon Division / urban Mandalay’ and ‘Other’ split. Hereafter these segments are 
referred to as the ‘Urban’ and ‘Rural’ segments. 
D. Fuel Zone Population
15. The energy consumption estimate for the household sector is significantly affected by the 
demographic of the population because the available fuels for cooking vary according to the 
temperate zones of the country. A spread of the household population is shown in Figure II-8 below,
characterized by agricultural zones1. These agricultural zones coincide with ‘fuel zones’ defined in the 
LIFT study as the ‘hilly zone’, the ‘dry zone’ and the ‘coastal/ delta’ zone. LIFT also defined a ‘Giri 
zone’ as a zone that has a unique fuel status due to the long lasting effects of cyclone Nargis. The hilly 
zone corresponds to the yellow shaded areas in Figure II-8, the dry zone to the green shaded area, 
and the coastal/delta zone to the brown shaded areas. The Giri zone is the smaller of the two 
brown-shaded areas to the north-west. The household population breakdown is shown in Table II-3, 
segmented by the fuel zones.

E. Fuel Substitution
17. Fuel substitution is driven by economic considerations. A comparison of the fuel costs of 
different cooking fuels reveals that on average basis the lowest energy cost fuel is biogas, followed by
firewood and electricity2
. Charcoal and LPGas are currently considerably more expensive.
 
2 The electricity tariff rate is taken from the World Bank National Electrification Plan report; 7 July 2014. 426

18. In the case of lighting, grid electricity is clearly the most economic choice if grid access is 
available. The relative attractiveness of electricity means that significant weight should be given to fuel 
substitution by electricity, consistent with a 100% national electrification plan.

III. RURAL HOUSEHOLD COOKING 
F. Cooking Energy Model
19. The modelling of household cooking energy demand depends on a variety of assumptions. 
The key assumptions are the quantities of fuels used in the daily cooking cycle today, and into the 
future; the calorific values of fuels in use or expected to be in use; the penetration of cooking 
appliances according to household income deciles; and the efficiencies of energy conversion by the 
technologies (useful to final energy). 
20. A schematic representation of a household cooking model is shown in Figure III-1. Cost factors 
influencing energy consumption are shown (red boxes). Inputs of the model are based on the 
abovementioned assumptions (green boxes). The outputs of the model (blue boxes) are computed by 
the model algorithms. 
Figure III-1: Rural HH Cooking Energy Model Structure
Sources: Consultant429
21. To apply the household cooking model requires a cooking appliance classification as shown in 
Table III-2.
Table III-2: Cooking Appliances & Fuel Type
Item Cooking Appliance Fuel Type
1 Open Fire / 3 stone stove Woody biomass
2 Fuel Efficient Stove Woody biomass
3 Charcoal Stove Charcoal
4 Rice Husk Stove Rice Husks
5 Electric Stove Electricity
6 Gas Ring LPG 
22. The cooking model requires an inventory of cooking appliances. The Energy Masterplan 
household survey results were used to establish such an inventory for Urban and Rural areas. These
results were then combined with LIFT household survey results to develop estimates of the inventory 
by income deciles and by fuel zone. Table III-3 and Table III-4 shows the inventory as at 2012, 
according to the % of common appliances over the total inventory population.

23. The cooking model also requires knowledge of the daily cooking cycle fuel / energy use. The 
EMP household survey was used to determine the daily cooking cycle fuel use for Urban and Rural 
households in 2014. The amount of fuel used for cooking was reported by households in each fuel 
zone and found to vary between the fuel zones as shown in Table III-5 and Table III-6 respectively.430

G. Cooking Energy Demand Model Calibration
25. The assumptions outlined in the preceding section, along with population estimates, were used 
to generate baseline cooking fuel and energy use estimates by fuel zone and by income decile. Fuel 
stacks were developed on energy consumption basis to test the validity of the model. 
26. Figure III-9 shows that the penetration of commercial fuels in the higher income deciles in the 
urban areas is significant compared to the penetration in rural areas that is shown in Figure III-10. 
27. The cooking energy measured in toe per household is 0.52 per Urban household and 0.60 per 
Rural household. These figures show the expected relative difference and compare well to 
international benchmarks for rural cooking energy consumption.
28. Estimates of the household cooking final energy consumption (FEC) in 2012-13 are given in
the following table:432

H. Final Energy Consumption Projections for HH Cooking
29. The projection of the final energy consumption for household cooking was made from the
baseline year of 2012-13. The projections take into account the rate at which household income 
increases over time, the change in population and the impact of grid electrification. More specifically 
assumptions common to all planning cases were 1) the rate of income growth was assumed to be 4% 
real on long-term basis, and 2) the population growth was assumed at a fixed rate of 1% per annum. 
30. A reference case assumed no change to the basic pattern of cooking fuel and appliance use, 
i.e. electricity grid subscription was taken to grow at the historical rate. Three cases were modelled
according to national rural electrification targets as follows:-
1. Assumption 81% grid electrification is reached by 2030;
2. Assumption 87% grid electrification is reached by 2030; and
3. Assumption 96% grid electrification is reached by 2030.434

31. The HH cooking model demonstrates that the Urban household projections are not greatly 
affected by electrification. This is to be expected as electrification is already advanced in the Urban 
area. The final energy consumption grows in line with the population. The Rural household projections 
show a reduction in energy consumption compared to a business as usual case. The difference in 
electrification between each case is not so marked that there is a substantial difference in energy 
efficiency between the cases.436

IV. HOUSEHOLD LIGHTING 
I. Lighting Energy Model
32. Several distinct elements are included in the rural household lighting model used for energy 
demand planning. These are the fuels known to be available and in use today or expected to be in use 
in the future, the calorific values of said fuels, the lighting technologies, the energy used by 
technology, rural household income deciles by fuel zone and by population, the rural household 
populations by fuel zone and the average family size. Furthermore where technologies / fuels are 
known to be absent from a particular fuel zone, and likely to remain so, they are excluded from the
model for that zone.
33. A schematic representation of the rural household lighting model and its inputs (green boxes) is 
shown in Figure IV-1. Factors influencing energy consumption are shown as drivers (red boxes). The 
outputs of the model (blue boxes) are computed by the model algorithms.

34. To apply the household cooking model requires a cooking appliance classification as shown in
Table IV-2.

35. The lighting model requires an inventory of cooking appliances. The Energy Masterplan 
household survey results were used to establish such an inventory for Urban and Rural areas. These 
results were then combined with LIFT household survey results to develop estimates of the inventory 
by income deciles and by fuel zone. Table IV-3 and Table IV-4 shows the inventory as at 2012, 
according to the % of common appliances over the total inventory population.

J. Lighting Energy Demand Model Calibration
38. The assumptions outlined in the preceding section, along with population estimates, were used 
to generate baseline cooking fuel and energy use estimates by fuel zone and by income decile. Fuel 
stacks were developed on energy consumption basis to test the validity of the model. 
39. Figure IV-8 shows that the penetration of commercial fuels in the higher income deciles in the 
urban areas is far more significant compared to the penetration in rural areas that is shown in Figure
IV-9.
40. The lighting energy measured in toe per household is 0.0021 per Urban household and 0.0022
per Rural household. As a result of energy poverty, the total lighting energy consumption in 2012-13 is 
most certainly insufficient to meet a minimum level of illumination required for task-based lighting such 
as reading. A typical Western standard for illumination for reading is 300 lux, whereas the average 
illumination level in the majority of Myanmar rural households is of the order of 10 lux. As a matter of 
energy policy the target demand for lighting services should be set according to a minimum standard 
of illumination. A suitable long-term intermediate illumination target for rural households in Myanmar is 
160 lux. This level of illumination can be met with a 1 watt LED lamp fitted with a polycarbonate lens or 
by grid-connected lighting. 
41. Estimates of the household lighting final energy consumption (FEC) in 2012-13 are given in the 
following table:-444

K. Final Energy Consumption Projections for HH Lighting
42. The projection of the final energy consumption for household lighting was made from the
baseline year of 2012-13. The projections take into account the rate at which household income 
increases over time, the change in population and the impact of grid electrification. More specifically 
assumptions common to all planning cases were 1) the rate of income growth was assumed to be 4% 
real on long-term basis, and 2) the population growth was assumed at a fixed rate of 1% per annum. 
43. A reference case assumed no change to the basic pattern of lighting fuel and appliance use, 
i.e. electricity grid subscription was taken to grow at the historical rate. Three alternative cases were 
also defined according to national rural electrification targets as follows:-
1. Assumption 81% grid electrification is reached by 2030;
2. Assumption 87% grid electrification is reached by 2030; and
3. Assumption 96% grid electrification is reached by 2030.446

 Sources: Consultant
Figure IV-11: Rural HH Lighting Final Energy Use
 Sources: Consultant447
44. The Urban lighting cases 1 to 3 show an increased energy consumption trajectory compared to 
the business as usual case. This is due to an accelerated electrification rate and population growth. 
The energy efficiency of lighting in the Rural sector improves as candles and oil lamps are replaced by 
grid lighting. The greater the extent of rural electrification, the greater the extent of the efficiency gain, 
despite the increasing population.

V. OTHER HOUSEHOLD ENERGY USE 
L. Introduction
45. Other household energy use falls into two categories – TV / entertainment and Cooling 
Services. TV / Entertainment end-use has been modelled using a similar approach to that used for 
household lighting. Cooling services includes cooling fans, air-conditioning and refrigeration. Due to 
paucity of data, cooling service end-use has been modelled as a net energy consumption where the 
net represents the difference between the total residential electricity consumption reported by YESB 
and ESE, and the total residential electricity use estimated for cooking, lighting and TV / 
entertainment. In this way there is consistency maintained between the ‘bottom-up’ electricity end-use 
estimates and the top-down electricity sales. The net energy consumption is validated by computing 
the equivalent cooling service given by the average net electricity consumption per Urban and Rural 
household, and by comparison of the toe per household between segments and across segments, 
particularly between lighting and cooling services.
M. TV / Entertainment
46. The estimate of energy consumption of TV / Entertainment category requires an inventory of 
appliances. The Energy Masterplan household survey results were used to establish such an 
inventory for Urban and Rural areas. These results were then combined with LIFT household survey 
results to develop estimates of the inventory by income deciles and by fuel zone. Table IV-3 shows the 
inventory as at 2012, according to the % of common appliances over the total inventory population.

watching TV (on appliance basis) in Urban and Rural areas. Again the results were combined with

deciles.

O. Other Energy Consumption Projections (Cooling Services)
52. The electricity sales consumption data reported by YESB and ESE were reconciled to the total 
electricity consumption estimates for household cooking, lighting and TV / Entertainment in 2012-13. 
The reconciliations were carried out separately for Urban and for Rural segments. The net energy 
estimate and forecasts for the ‘Other’ energy category are provided in the following tables. The toe per 
household for the Other category (average basis) is of the same order as for lighting in the Rural 
segment suggesting that the predominant form of cooling is electric fans. In the Urban segment the 
toe per household for the Other category is a factor of four greater. These comparisons are a 
reasonable validation of the estimates. The forecast shows a convergence between the Urban and 
Rural segments as rural electrification proceeds to a 100% target.

I. SUMMARY 
A. Introduction
1. This summary report presents the aggregate demand projections for biomass, solid fuels, liquid 
fuels and electricity for Myanmar. The demand projection for biomass is given according to the 
forecasts developed for household and economic sectors using firewood, charcoal and woody 
biomass. Solid fuel is primarily coal and is an aggregation of the forecasts for the energy-intensive 
and SME industry sectors. Liquid fuel forecasts represent an aggregation of demands of the economic 
and household sectors. In the case of electricity the demand projections are presented in this report 
as ‘top-down’ forecasts for Yangon Division and the fourteen States and Regions that collectively 
make up the countryside areas of Myanmar. Residential, commercial, light industry and heavy 
industry electricity consumption energy forecasts have been forecast separately. A reconciliation 
process was undertaken to ensure that the aggregated electricity consumption forecast is fully 
consistent with the individual electricity consumption forecasts presented in the Agriculture, Industry, 
Commerce & Public Services and Household sector reports of this Energy Masterplan.
B. Final Energy Consumption Projection for Myanmar
2. The aggregate final energy consumption (FEC) forecast for Myanmar is given in Figure I-1. In 
the case of the medium growth final energy consumption is forecast to rise at a compound annual 
growth rate of 3.0% from 2012 to 2030, from 12.7 mtoe to 21.9 mtoe.

3. The low, medium and high growth cases in Figure I-1 correspond to a) GDP growth of 4.8%, 
7.1% and 9.5% respectively, and b) electrification ratios of 80%, 87% and 86% respectively.461
4. Figure I-2 to Figure I-5 provide a detailed breakdown of FEC for the medium demand growth 
forecast by sector and by energy carrier. Given the dominance of household cooking energy 
consumption, Figure I-4 shows the FEC projection without the household sector.

IV. ELECTRICITY FORECAST (TOP – DOWN RECONCILIATION) 
T. Introduction
16. Electricity consumption forecasts were presented in the previous section as a summary of 
‘bottom-up’ forecasts for each economic sector. These ‘bottom-up’ forecasts have been reconciled to 
‘top-down’ load forecasts developed by forecasting electricity sales from historical statistics gathered 
from MoEP and shaped by GDP sector growth. The reconciled ‘top-down’ forecasts are presented in 
this section of the report.
17. In the case of the household sector the plan for national electrification was taken into account. 
National electrification targets were targeted as low case – 80%, medium case – 87% and high case –
96%; to be achieved by 2030. Top-down electricity forecasts were then prepared as follows:
1. Historical consumption and demand trends were examined and modelled by State and 
Region; the model was calibrated so that estimated demand (including losses) matched with 
demand reported by MoEP for each State and Region;
2. Electricity consumption was forecast for each State and Region according to national 
electrification targets, per consumer energy consumption (kWh per customer) and GDP 
growth across residential, commercial and industrial consumer categories; and
3. The individual sector estimates were aggregated on State and Region basis and for Myanmar 
as a whole.
18. No allowance has been made for large developments such as the Dawei industrial zone / port 
development, or for large mines. In these cases it is usual for a developer or a mine owner to 
construct a captive power plant. 
U. Planning Assumptions
19. Planning assumptions extend to electricity losses, energy consumption trends and economic

V. Energy Consumption Trends
20. Energy consumption trends are observed as a change to the customer’s annual consumption 
of power. In the case of electricity, kWh per consumer is the measure of electricity consumption. 
Figure IV-3 and Figure IV present the electricity consumption per consumer for the Commercial & 
Light Industrial segment in Yangon Division and by State / Regions. The kWh per consumer growth 
trend for the Yangon commercial and light industrial segment shows an average growth of 2%. The

W. Economic Trends
23. It is observed that in the non-oil producing countries, GDP and the growth in non-residential 
electricity consumption are strongly correlated. The relationship between the natural logarithm of GDP 
and the natural logarithm of GWh consumption is typically linear. Figure IV-7 shows that the 
relationship of non-residential electricity consumption and GDP in Myanmar has not been linear and is 
therefore unsuitable as an input to forecasting.

Y. Myanmar Consolidated Electricity Forecasts
25. The medium growth case forecast for Myanmar shows an expected growth of peak demand 
MW from the current level of 2 100 MW to around 9 500 MW by 2030. This case calls for an average 
annual addition of generation capacity of around 440 MW from now to year 2030. The growth 
projections can also be understood in terms of the average kWh / capita growth; from 200 to 800 kWh 
per capita by 2030.

APPENDIX: Myanmar State and Region Electricity Demand Growth503
AYERWADDY REGION
1. Ayerwaddy occupies the delta region of the Ayerwaddy River (Irrawaddy River). It is bordered 
by Bago Region to the north, Bago Region and Yangon Region to the east, and the Bay of Bengal to 
the south and west. It is contiguous with the Rakhine State in the northwest. The Region is heavily 
forested and wood products are an important component of the economy. The principal crop of 
Ayerwaddy is rice, and the region is called the “granary of Burma.” In addition to rice, other crops 
include maize, sesame, groundnut, sunflower, beans, pulses and jute. Fisheries are also important; 
the Region produces fish, prawn, fish-paste, dry fish, dry prawn and fish sauce.
2. Ayerwaddy Region also has considerable tourist potential. The city of Pathein has numerous 
historic sights and temples. Outside Pathein are the beach resorts of Chaungtha Beach and the lake 
resort of Inye Lake. Inye Lake is well known for fishery as the major supplier of fresh water fish. 
However, hotel and transportation infrastructure is still very poorly developed.
Residential Connections Forecast
3. In the last six years the reported new connection rate has been high at an average of 9%; the 
rate appears to reflect the low electrification rate.

Region and Mandalay Region to the north; Kayin State, Mon State and the Gulf of Martaban to the 
east; Yangon Region to the south and Ayerwaddy Region and Rakhine State to the west.
7. The regional economy is strongly dependent on the timber trade. Taungoo, in the northern end 
of the Bago Region, is bordered by mountain ranges, home to teak and other hardwoods. Another 
natural resource is petroleum. The major crop is rice which occupies over two-thirds of the available 
agricultural land. Other major crops include betel nut, sugarcane, maize, groundnut, sesamum,
sunflower, beans and pulses, cotton, jute, rubber, tobacco, tapioca, banana, Nipa palm and toddy. 
Industry includes fisheries, salt, ceramics, sugar, paper, plywood, distilleries and monosodium 
glutamate.
8. Bago has a small livestock breeding and fisheries sector, and a small industrial sector. In 2005
it had over 4 million farm animals; nearly 3 000 acres (12 km2) of fish and prawn farms; and about 3
000 private factories and about 100 state owned factories.
Residential Connections Forecast
9. In the last six years, the reported new connection rate has been high at an average of 16%.
This rate appears to have resulted in the relatively high electrification rate of 54%. This rate suggests 
that Bago Region citizens are relatively wealthy due to the diverse nature of economic activity 
including a degree of industrialization.

with other important crops including millet, maize, sesame, groundnut, garlic and vegetables. Mineral 
products include alabaster, tin and tungsten. Valuable woods such as teak and pine were once 
produced, but the forests have largely been stripped bare by illegal logging. The hydroelectric power 
plant at Lawpita Falls outside of Loikaw is of strategic importance, as it supplies over 20% of 
Myanmar's total electrical power. Kayah State has theoretical tourist potential, if the political situation 
is resolved. The state has rugged mountains, river streams, lakes and waterfalls; however, transport 
and communication are difficult.
Residential Connections Forecast

SHAN STATE
59. Shan State borders China to the north, Laos to the east, Thailand to the south, and five 532
administrative divisions of Myanmar to the west.
60. Silver, lead and zinc are mined, notably at the Bawdwin mine, and there are smelters at Namtu. 
Teak is extracted from the local forests. Rice and all sorts of fresh fruit and vegetables are grown due 
to the temperate but sunny climate. Shan State is part of the Golden Triangle, an area in which much 
of the world's opium and heroin are illegally produced. 
61. There are border trading centres along the Shan State border and neighbour countries. Muse, 
the largest border trading centre along the Myanmar China border and Tachileik and another 
important trading centre between Myanmar and Thailand. The China-Myanmar oil and gas pipelines 
pass through the northern part of Shan State.
Residential Connections Forecast
62. In the last six years the reported new connection rate has been high at an average of 16%. This 
rate appears to have supported the achievement of a residential electrification rate at 23%.

TANINTHARYI REGION
65. Tanintharyi Region covers a long narrow southern part of the country on the Kra Isthmus. It 
borders the Andaman Sea to the west and the Tenasserim Hills beyond which lies Thailand to the east. 
To the north is the Mon State. There are many islands off the coast the large Mergui Archipelago in the 
southern and central coastal areas and the smaller Moscos Islands off the northern shores. The 
capital of the division is Dawei (Tavoy). 
Residential Connections Forecast
66. In the last six years the reported new connection rate has been low at an average of 1%. This

YANGON
69. Yangon is the country’s main centre for trade, industry, real estate, media, entertainment and 
tourism. The city of Yangon alone represents about one fifth of the national economy. According to 
official statistics for FY 2010–2011, the size of the economy of Yangon Region was 8.93 trillion kyats, 
or 23% of the national GDP.
70. The city is Lower Burma’s main trading hub for all kinds of merchandise – from basic food 
stuffs to used cars although commerce continues to be hampered by the city's severely 
underdeveloped banking industry and communications infrastructure. Bayinnaung Market is the 
largest wholesale centre in the country for rice, beans and pulses, and other agricultural commodities. 
Much of the country’s legal imports and exports go through Thilawa Port, the largest and busiest port 
in Burma. There is also a great deal of informal trade, especially in street markets that exist alongside 
street platforms of Downtown Yangon's townships. 
71. Manufacturing accounts for a sizable share of employment. At least 14 light industrial zones 
ring Yangon, directly employing over 150,000 workers in 4,300 factories in early 2010. The city is the 
centre of country's garment industry which exported US$292 million in 2008/9 fiscal year. More than 
80 % of factory workers in Yangon work on a day-to-day basis. Most are young women between 15 
and 27 years of age who come from the countryside in search of a better life. The manufacturing 
sector suffers from both structural problems (e.g. chronic power shortages) and political problems (e.g. 
economic sanctions). In 2008, Yangon's 2500 factories alone needed about 120 MW of power; yet, 
the entire city received only about 250 MW of the 530 MW needed. Chronic power shortages limit the 
factories' operating hours between 8 am and 6 pm.
72. Tourism represents a major source of foreign currency for the city although by Southeast Asian 
standards the actual number of foreign visitors to Yangon has always been quite low. The number of 
visitors dipped even further following the Saffron Revolution and Cyclone Nargis. The recent 
improvement in the country's political climate has attracted an increasing number of businessmen and
tourists. It is estimated that between 300 000 to 400 000 visitors went through Yangon International in 
2011. However, after years of underinvestment, Yangon's modest hotel infrastructure—only 3 000 of 
the total 8 000 hotel rooms in Yangon are "suitable for tourists"—is already bursting at seams, and will 
need to be expanded to handle additional visitors. As part of an urban development strategy, a hotel 
zone has been planned in Yangon's outskirts, encompassing government- and military-owned land in 
Mingaladon, Hlegu and Htaukkyant Townships.
Residential Connections Forecast

Yangon Industrial Zones
79. Yangon has 18 established industrial zones (IZ’s) with another 3 under consideration. These 
zones represent a significant part of the daily Yangon load. The rate of electricity demand growth has 
been analysed and Gompertz saturation curves developed to describe the anticipated growth of the 
IZ’s until 2035 (both existing and planned).

80. The saturation curve shown in Figure IV-94 represents an aggregated load demand curve. 
Saturation growth curves were developed for each IZ according to the load in 2013 and the substation 
capacity supplying the IZ. The individual saturation curves were summated to determine the total IZ 
load forecast. However this load does not represent the total heavy industrial load as industry also 
operates outside the IZ’s.
Total Demand Projection for Yangon
81. The approach used to project total demand was as follows.
1. The residential load was forecast based on customer growth and a constant kWh per 
customer assumption of 1 900kWh per consumer;
2. Total commercial and industrial load GWh was projected by the use of linear regression on 
Myanmar GDP. The load included in the regression included light and heavy industry 
including the load of the IZ’s; 
Figure IV-96: Regression – GDP versus C&I MW
82. These two energy forecasts were summed and the IZ load determined by the saturation curve 
method was then subtracted to determine a ‘public load’ forecast (in the manner that YESC reports 
load). Using this approach all end-use sector energy was forecasted and finally aggregated.Project Number: TA No. 8356-MYA

I. LIQUID & GASEOUS FUEL STRATEGY 
A. Introduction 
1. Myanmar’s economy is expected to grow at a rate of 7.1%, which will result in an increase in 
the demand for liquid fuels – a demand which is currently covered mainly with imported 
hydrocarbons. Covering the liquid fuel needs of a growing economy with imports would negatively 
affect Myanmar’s trade balance in the future – identification of local alternatives is therefore wise. 
Some possibilities for initiating local production of liquid and gaseous fuels are presented in this 
report.
2. The Republic of the Union of Myanmar possesses large resources of natural gas. It plays a 
significant role in the country’s energy mix: in recent years natural gas accounted for 45% of the total 
primary energy production. At home the natural gas was mainly used for electricity production and 
industrial purposes, whereas the largest part of the gas produced in Myanmar was given for export. 
Myanmar’s proven petroleum gas reserve lies between 6 and 32 times the energy value of proven 
oil reserves, according to whether the Ministry of Energy or US Energy assessments are correct.
Pending further discoveries of oil, it is only Myanmar’s petroleum gas that can be considered to be a 
strategic resource – it is in demand internationally, whereas locally gas could potentially be allocated 
to pharmaceutical and chemical industry processes, to fertilizer production, to the production of 
refined petroleum products, to power production, for passenger vehicles, and as a cooking fuel as 
economic development takes place. In recent years the Government has considered the possibility 
to establish an LNG terminal to supplement indigenous natural gas supplies. 
3. Biodiesel / bioethanol production in Myanmar is currently limited to only a few production 
facilities. Existing bioethanol facilities have more or less stopped production due to lack of subsidies 
and no information indicating new facilities being under construction was found. Only pilot scale 
biodiesel facilities have been built in Myanmar, which are producing small amounts of biodiesel for 
use by agricultural machinery. Approximately ten years ago Myanmar began an ambitious biofuel 
implementation program with a plan to plant a total of 3.5 million hectares of jatropha curcas trees. 
The program was unsuccessful failing to live up to the expectations of making Myanmar 
self-sufficient as far as the demand for diesel goes. The estimated yield of the jatropha trees planted 
as part of the program is not available, but considering that several reports have claimed that 
jatropha plantations covered an area of approximately 2 million hectares, the trees seem to have 
offered a significant source of non-edible oil that could be used for the production of biodiesel
B. Liquid & Gaseous Fuel Strategy 
4. Refined Oil Products. The first step in defining the strategy for liquid fuels is to identify what 
should be done with the country’s existing refinery capacity. Three small refineries are currently in 
operation in Myanmar, but all three are old and their operating efficiency is low. Even if The 
Myanmar Petroleum Enterprise decides to upgrade at least one of the existing refineries, the 
throughput will not be sufficient to cover the increasing demand; hence the strategy for liquid fuels 
must be based on construction of new capacity and / or by importing. For the imports there are initial 
plans for a new import terminal, which could at a later stage support a new local refinery. However, it 
is believed that a small scale coastal refinery may not be economically feasible under the 
competitive pressure from large, world class refineries in the Middle East, India and Southeast Asia.548
5. Myanmar has the right to use 50 000 bbl/day of the transfer capacity of the Sino-Burma 
pipeline, which could be used as a feedstock for a potential new refinery. Locating a refinery inland, 
adjacent to the pipeline, could result in a competitive advantage as production would be close to 
consumption which would in turn reduce transportation costs. 
6. Accordingly it is recommended to undertake a detailed feasibility study for a new inland oil 
refinery. The concept is based on the development of a small, low complexity inland oil refinery that 
is powered by residual heavy distillates (supplemented by a small coal-fired power plant using 
Myanmar coal). The strategic advantage of this approach is that a low complexity refinery does not 
require a supply of natural gas. The sizing of the refinery at 50,000 bpd is consistent with Myanmar’s 
quota of Arab heavy sour oil, furthermore, the liquid fuel demand of the transport sector requires a 
balanced production of gasoline and diesel fuel which leads to efficient refinery operation. The 
economic feasibility of this proposal is largely based on the inland location of the refinery (at the 
pipeline) with associated low cost to transport fuel to consumers. Intangible benefits relate to the 
tradition of refining in Myanmar through the three existing refineries; refining provides the domestic 
industry sector with added depth, supporting the existence of a downstream industry. On the other 
hand a small refinery will no supply all of Myanmar’s highly refined petroleum product needs – while 
the transport and industry sector needs can be satisfied, imports of diesel fuel will be required to 
meet the demands of agriculture up to 25% of total by 2030.
7. Natural Gas. The projection for gas supply – demand shows that the outlook is tight. The 
following supply – demand projection shows that the M3 gas field will be needed to meet demand. If 
there is any delay to the development of the field would result in a sustained supply shortfall from 
2018.

Source: JICA (2014)
8. There is an opportunity to manage the risks that natural gas supplies do not develop as 
anticipated. If required, fuel imports can be used to supplement the supply to the transportation and 
agriculture sectors to release the capacity required to serve the industry and power sectors. 
Nevertheless, ahead of the development of firm supplies of natural gas, it is considered as a prudent 
practice to minimize the use of natural gas in the power sector in favor of allocation to industry.
9. Moreover a local refinery can be designed to minimize gas consumption. Power at peak 
times could be provided by additional storage hydropower or gas / oil plants mainly powered by oil to 
conserve gas. A fertilizer plant appears to be uneconomic and gas will be saved by importing urea. 
An LNG terminal would deliver gas at international prices but would be expensive for Myanmar, 
particularly for the power sector. Moreover the development of an LNG terminal would take at least 5 
years. In the recent past it was considered that the M3 field would commence operation in 2019 but 
recent developments in Thailand and the depressed international prices for oil and gas is expected 
to result in an indefinite delay. It is recommended that the development of an LNG terminal is 
considered in conjunction with the timing of the M3 field, and in the meantime a detailed study of 
industry need for gas is undertaken complete with a Willingness-to-Pay assessment to establish the 
viability of high-price LNG imports (and therefore the viability of an LNG terminal).
10. In summary, gas could be reserved for industry and the power sector. Other demands could 
be met by alternative means. The decision to pursue alternatives, such as an LNG terminal, can be 
decided as a matter of government policy as the natural gas supply – demand balance unfolds in the 
coming years.
11. Biofuels. In future diesel and gasoline production could be supplemented by production of 
biodiesel from oily plants and of bioethanol from starchy crops. Considering the large surface area 550
and good growing conditions in Myanmar, liquid fuels produced from renewable feedstock could 
play a significant role in the supply of transportation fuels. 
12. Other crops could also be utilized for the production of biodiesel, but the first step 
recommended to be taken is to identify the current state of the planted jatropha trees and the means 
that are available for improving the yield from these trees. Afterwards the focus should be shifted on 
harvesting methods and defining how the seeds are best processed into biodiesel and whether this 
should be conducted in large facilities or on a community level.
13. Use of bioethanol should also be considered. Sugarcane, whether used as whole or only in 
the form of molasses seems to present the most cost-effective way of producing bioethanol utilizing 
first generation production technology. The concept of blend wall, meaning in essence that 
approximately 10 % bioethanol can be blended with gasoline without the need for updating the 
vehicle fleet is coming less important as flex-fuel vehicles, either new one or retrofits, have proved a 
low-cost solution to pursue consumer side interest in bioethanol fuel.
14. Both biodiesel and bioethanol seem economically feasible for Myanmar. A biofuel policy with 
set mixing targets for 2020 and 2030 is recommended. Assuming a 10 % target for both diesel and 
gasoline by 2020, and 20 % target by 2030, transport de-carbonisation case can be developed. 
Alternative scenarios are discussed in this report, namely a base case, a small inland refinery case, 
and domestic biofuel case, and their impacts to the supply side of liquid fuels until 2030 in Myanmar. 
II. PETROLEUM FUELS 
C. Introduction 
15. Myanmar’s liquid fuel production capacity is insufficient for satisfying the growing demand for 
liquid fuels in the transportation sector. However, increased dependence on imported petroleum 
products poses a risk to national fuel security and is a burden on the nation’s trade balance. 
16. The expansion of a local refinery has been under consideration of the government. The cost 
and benefits of such an expansion are discussed in detail. The possibility to supplement the current 
oil based liquid fuel system with biodiesel and bioethanol to satisfy transport demands is also 
discussed. However, the demand for liquid fuels outside of the transport and industry sectors is not 
considered. The agriculture sector demand for diesel is expected to grow, to support farm 
mechanization, but this demand is relatively uncertain compared to that of the transport and industry 
sectors. Again, biodiesel and bioethanol could be attractive alternatives to petroleum products for 
agriculture, due to the close proximity of the feedstock, otherwise the agriculture sector could be 
supplied by imported fuels until the trend towards agricultural mechanization is better established.
17. A concept for increasing Myanmar’s oil refining capacity is introduced. The concept is based 
on a relatively small inland refinery with feedstock sourced from the Sino-Burma pipeline. The 
expected competitive advantage of the refinery against some of the large scale refineries located at 
Southeast Asia lies in its inland location, which minimizes the costs related to transportation of the 
refined products to the local inland market. The size of the refinery is dictated by the quota of 50 000 
barrels per day (bbl/day) Myanmar has for the Sino-Burma pipeline. The concept of an inland 
refinery based on crude in the Sino-Burma pipeline has been criticized for its choice of crude, which 
is ultimately determined by the Chinese off-taker. Local crude is of different quality, and can be 551
utilized only partly in the contemplated concept. Therefore, an alternative idea of having crude 
receiving terminal at the coastal area of Myanmar, and a possible local refinery at a later stage
attached to it, which would be able to process a mixture of imported and domestically sourced crude 
oil. Whilst an import terminal may be needed for Myanmar’s continuing need to import petroleum 
products, it is believed that it would be difficult for a finery of relatively modest capacity in 
international standards to find competitive advantage against new Middle Eastern, Indian and 
Southeast Asian refineries, many of which represent large scale, cost competitive refinery concepts 
and latest technology, but there could be a clear location based advantage for an inland refinery, 
which, however, needs to be proven by thorough feasibility analysis.

18. Information presented in Table II-1 is also presented in Figure II-2 to highlight the expected 
increase in demand for liquid fuels in Myanmar.
Figure II-2: Demand of Petroleum Fuels in Myanmar
19. Considering that the combined demand for diesel and gasoline in Myanmar is currently 
about 30 000 bbl/day (not including illegal imports), and that only the Thanbyakan refinery is capable 
of producing diesel and gasoline at 10 000 bbl combined per day, without a significant increase in 552
local refining capacity Myanmar will become increasingly dependent on imported petroleum 
products with attendant fuel security concerns.
20. So as to further elaborate the issues surrounding fuel security, the Consultant has developed 
a new oil refinery concept for Myanmar, the merits of which concept, however, need to be analysed 
by a more comprehensive feasibility analysis. The concept is discussed in the following sections.
21. Options for Oil Refinery Investment. Three options have been identified for development of 
the oil refinery sector in Myanmar. The identified options are:-
1. To invest in a small inland refinery by the Sino-Burma pipeline to cover the growing need for 
transportation fuels at the inland market; 
2. To invest in a medium sized refinery to cover the need for transportation fuels in the whole 
country;
3. To invest in oil refining sector and build a globally competitive oil refinery producing high 
quality liquid transportation fuels to cover the domestic demand and to be exported to the 
Asia Pacific petroleum product markets. 
22. Small Size Refinery. Out of the three identified alternatives, the first one seems most 
attractive. It could be realized by lowest capital investment and its inland location would offer 
competitive advantage as both the feedstock from the Sino-Burma pipeline as well as the target 
market would be in the close proximity of the refinery. A small refinery size would also fit well with 
Myanmar’s quota of 50 000 bbl/day from the Sino-Burma pipeline.
23. Middle and Large Size Refinery. Due to Myanmar’s limited oil quota (50 000 bbl/day) to the 
Sino-Burma oil pipeline, middle or large size refinery cannot be considered to be built inland. A
coastal refinery would not have the advantage of being in the middle of the country where there is 
direct access to the transportation fuel market of Myanmar’s second largest city Mandalay. Middle 
and large size refineries would need significant quantities of natural gas for cracking of heavy 
distillates as the demands for refinery residues and heavy products are not expected to experience 
large scale growth. As the availability of natural gas is unclear, building a middle or large sized 
refinery might require constructing an unloading terminal for liquefied natural gas (LNG). An LNG 
terminal would not only significantly increase the investment cost but due to the high LNG price at 
the Asia Pacific market, it would also increase the refinery’s operating costs remarkably. A middle 
size refinery could be an attractive proposition in the event that domestic natural gas production was 
to grow, or other sources of natural gas could be secured below the market price for LNG. However, 
according to what is known at the present time, both middle and large size refineries appear to be 
unattractive under the current circumstances; therefore this report only develops the option of 
investing in a small scale refinery.
D. Investment in a Small Size Refinery
24. A small size refinery would enjoy a competitive advantage against refineries located in 
neighbouring countries, such as the new Paradip Refinery in India. The advantage would be gained
in the lower transportation cost of both the feedstock and of the refined products to consumers More 
than half of Myanmar’s population lives in landlocked states and regions and of the 12 major cities 
only four – Sittwe, Yangon, Pathein and Mawlamyaing – have direct access to or are located very 
close to the sea (see Table II-3 and Figure II-4). If transportation fuels were also in future mostly 
imported e.g. from the Paradip Refinery, it would be necessary to unload fuel at the major port cities, 
then to transport by road, river barge or by rail to the landlocked regions and cities.553
25. The refinery would mostly use the Arab Heavy Blend (Heavy, Sour) available from the 
Sino-Burma pipeline as a feedstock, supplemented by small quantities of the local heavy sweet 
crude sourced from local onshore oil fields. Freight costs and quality differences between the 
condensate produced at the offshore oil and gas fields and the Arab Heavy Blend suggest that it 
could be more cost-effective to export the condensate to neighbouring coastal refineries than 
transporting it to a domestic inland refinery.
26. The sea freight cost for supplying the fuel from Paradip Refinery to coastal cities like Sittwe 
and Yangon would be approximately 1.5 – 2.5 $ per barrel. Furthermore, the freight cost for 
transporting the fuel from Sittwe e.g. to Mandalay Region would add another 2.5 – 3.5 $ per barrel. If 
production is located in close proximity to consumption, a significant competitive advantage would 
be gained according to reduced freight costs. Another item that must be considered is the economy 
of scale. A large refinery such as Paradip (300 000 bbl/day) benefits from reduced operating costs. 
The difference in operating costs between a large scale and a small scale refinery is around 1 – 2 $ 
per barrel depending on the complexity of the smaller refinery.

27. Three different scenarios for the estimated freight costs are shown in Table II-5. The 
scenarios are chosen based on the distance of the demand from the inland refinery (short, medium 
and long distance). As can be seen from Table II-5, a small inland refinery would face serious 
competition when it comes to the transportation fuel market of Myanmar’s coastal cities. Yangon 
International Airport would for example most likely continue to import jet fuel even in the case a 
small domestic refinery was built.

were not taken into account in calculations presented in Table II-5; it was assumed that the freight 
cost of crude oil would be approximately the same to all refineries in neighbour countries.

29. According to Table II-5, a small domestic inland refinery would have a clear freight cost 
advantage against its competitors in Myanmar’s inland transportation fuel markets. Based on the 
population spread presented in Table II-3, inland transport fuel sales can be assumed to account for
approximately 60 % of the total sales. According to the demand prognosis (Table II-1) Myanmar’s 
total gasoline, diesel and jet fuel consumption in 2030 would be around 81 000 boe/day and 
assuming that consumption would increase evenly in inland and coastal regions, the total inland 
consumption in 2030 would be 48 500 boe/day. 
 
2 The table presents three cases: best, average and worse depending on the distance between the inland refinery 
and the point of demand – the reduction in revenue in pipeline tariff is assumed to be $0.3 for the best case and $0.9 
for the worst case.556
30. One of the main uncertainties of the presented small inland refinery business case is the tariff 
revenue that Myanmar gets for transporting oil to the People’s Republic of China (PRC) along the 
Sino-Burma pipeline. In the calculation presented in Table II-5 it was presumed that PRC pays 
Myanmar a transportation fee for each barrel they receive and that the operating margin Myanmar 
receives for oil transportation would be 0.3 $, 0.6 $ or 0.9 $ per barrel. The pipeline transportation 
tariff rate could have a major impact on the profitability of the refinery since oil used at the refinery 
would reduce the income from oil transport to PRC. 
31. In addition to the competitive advantage that an inland refinery could have against other 
refineries it is important to understand the total refinery margin. Refine margin is the difference in 
total price of the products that a refinery sells minus the price of the feedstock. The total operating 
margin per barrel is calculated by deducting the operational costs from the refining margin. In 
general a more complex refinery has a higher refining margin and a higher investment cost. More 
complex refineries are capable of using cheaper heavier oil blends with higher sulphur content
whereas simpler refineries have to buy lighter oil blends with lower sulphur content. The most 
common crude oil blends and their characteristics are shown in the Figure II-6.
Figure II-6: Characteristics of Crude Oil Blend
Source: EIA (2014)557
32. There are numerous variations for how the oil refining process could be designed. Each oil 
refining process has different functions and yield profiles which directly affect the refining and 
operating margins. One way of simplifying numerous different oil refinery processes is to sort them 
into four generalized categories according to their process complexity as presented in Table II-7.
Table II-7: Generalized Process Complexity Categories
Process Complexity Category Feedstock
High Deep Conversion Heavy Sour
Intermediate Hydrocracking Heavy Sour
Elementary Catalytic Cracking
70 % Light, Sweet & 30 % 
Heavy, Sweet
Low Hydro-skimming, Topping Light, Sweet
33. Since the goal is to achieve maximum production of high quality transportation fuels, and the 
main feedstock is assumed to be heavy and sour (Arab Heavy) from the Sino-Burma pipeline, for a 
satisfactory refining margin to be achieved a small inland refinery must have intermediate or high 
process complexity. A hydrocracking refinery using heavy and sour feedstock produces significantly 
more middle distillates (diesel and jet fuel) than a catalytic cracking refinery. 
34. An example of the product slate received from different refinery configurations is shown in 
Table II-8. It should be emphasized that today’s modern hydrocracking and deep conversion 
refineries are relatively flexible giving the refiners control over the proportion of middle and light 
distillates that are produced. In Table II-9, the differences in the product slate are converted into 
sales according to the average market prices at New York and Rotterdam between October 1, 2013 
and September 30, 2014. It can be seen that with crude prices of the same period exceeding 100 
$/bbl hydro-skimming and catalytic cracking type of refineries are not feasible, and many of such 
types have not been developed anymore except under special circumstances.
35. It has to be noted that the prices of the residue and heavy products have significant 
differences depending on their location. Furthermore, the refinery configurations given in Table II-8
and Table II-9 have been generalized and the exact product slate in the residue and heavy products 
category is also depended on the exact production line configuration of the refinery within the given 
generalized refinery configurations. For example a deep conversion refinery can have a fluid coking 
unit that, as a residue, produces low energy content gas that cannot be sold outside the refinery but 
can easily be burned in process furnaces. Alternatively a refinery can have a delayed coking unit 
that produces coal-like petroleum coke as a residue that can either be sold or used in a circulated 
fluidized bed boiler for refinery’s steam and electricity production.558

36. An oil refinery consumes a significant amount of energy in process furnaces and in form of 
steam and electricity. In addition to energy consumption, a hydrocracking process requires also 
significant quantities of hydrogen. The lack of natural gas for domestic consumption in Myanmar
means that the refinery’s energy supply and production configuration cannot be standard, as natural 
gas is often the main source for steam and electricity generation and in most cases it is also the
most important source of the hydrogen used by the hydrocracking unit. For the small inland refinery,
the energy supply could be based on a combination of coal, refinery residue and petroleum coke 
from the delayed coking unit. The investment cost of a combined heat and power plant burning solid 
fuel with a high sulphur content, would be significantly higher than the cost to build an ordinary 
combined cycle gas turbine power plant, but the power plant investment could be made in 
co-operation with a local power generation company and the power plant could in addition to the 
refinery’s energy needs also generate electricity to the national power grid. 
37. For a hydrocracking unit with capacity between 15,000 and 20,000 barrels per day about
45,000 – 60,000 cubic meters of natural gas per day would be needed for hydrogen production. The 
exact amount of natural gas consumption depends on the feedstock and the desired product slate. 559
Production of light distillates such as gasoline requires more hydrogen than the production of middle 
distillates such as jet fuel, diesel and heating oil. Since it is unlikely that there is enough natural gas 
for a hydrocracking unit, the ideal configuration of a small inland refinery could be based on a 
catalytic cracking design with a delayed coking or vis-breaking unit. In principle this configuration 
could operate without any natural gas, instead steam and electricity could be produced by using the 
refinery residues, coal and petroleum coke. A refinery with catalytic cracking and delayed coking
configuration (no hydrocracking) would produce more low value refinery residue and heavy products
but the deficit in natural gas supply means that the demand for the refinery residue and heavy 
products would be stable.
38. An example of the potential production capacity of a refinery designed to use Arab heavy 
sour oil, is presented in Table II-10. A process schematic of the envisaged refinery is given as Figure 
II-11.

39. Due to the high share of residue and heavy products produced by a catalytic cracking refinery,
the optimal throughput capacity could be more than 50 000 barrels per day. A feedstock capacity of 
50 000 barrels per day would yield approximately 35 000 boe per day in transportation fuels even if 
in addition to the catalytic cracking unit a delayed coking or vis-breaking unit were to be added. 
Additionally, refinery downtime would reduce the total yield by 8 – 10 % which means that the total 
transportation fuel output would be about 20 % lower than the predicted inland consumption in 2030
(40 500 boe per day). However, due to the relatively low refinery complexity and the possibility for
outsourcing the steam and electricity production, the total investment cost of the small inland 
refinery with catalytic cracking and delayed coking or vis-breaking could be under 1 200 million US
dollars even if the feedstock capacity were to be slightly increased.
40. Figure II-12 and Figure II-13 present the total production of diesel and gasoline compared to 
the estimated demand (as presented in Table II-3). The demand presented is the estimated total 
demand, so it can be assumed that part of the local production deficit will be balanced by imports 
especially to the coastal regions. Figure II-12 shows the diesel demand of the transport sector by a 
green line. As all of the gasoline demand is for transport sector, one can observe from the graphs
that the conceptual 50 000 bbl/d refinery would cover most of domestic transport sector fuel 
demand. If liquid biofuels were to be introduced to the supply portfolio, Myanmar could achieve 
almost full fuel independence for at least the first years of refinery operation.

41. In the future, once the technologies for producing renewable transportation fuels in the form 
of biodiesel and bioethanol become more advanced and therefore more cost competitive, the 
production of the new refinery can be supplemented with a construction of both biodiesel as well as 
bioethanol production facilities to further improve Myanmar’s supply security. The size of the 
facilities producing renewable transportation fuels should be determined, once the final configuration 
of the small refinery is known. Considering the current demand forecasts, there seems to be a larger 
need for a facility producing bioethanol that could be blended with gasoline to reduce the supply 
deficit. It would be wise to locate the possible biodiesel and bioethanol production facilities closer to 
coastal regions to achieve a good nationwide balance between supply and demand. Biodiesel and 
bioethanol are discussed in more detail in Section VII.562

42. Feasibility of the Small Inland Refinery. The feasibility of an investment in a small inland 
refinery is mainly dependent on the heavy product consumption and energy supply of the envisaged 
inland refinery, as well as future investments in oil refineries in neighboring countries. Even though 
the small inland refinery will benefit from lower freight costs and from the relatively low price of the 
Arab Heavy Blend oil, the refinery complexity will remain moderate until a cost effective natural gas 
supply can be made available. Energy supply (steam and electricity) often accounts up to 40 % of 
the refinery’s operating expenses and so the cost of the energy supply largely determines the net 
benefits case.
43. The most effective way to organize the energy supply of the refinery would be a large scale
power plant based on circulated fluidized bed boiler that would be able to utilize refinery residues 
and coal and, in addition to supplying energy to the refinery, could sell electricity to the grid.
44. Feasibility is also affected by the development of competition from the refineries producing in 
neighbouring countries and willing to sell to Myanmar. This risk appears to be small. Apart from the 
Paradip Refinery in India, which is expected to start operation in 2015, there are no new large scale 
refineries under construction. It is anticipated that the Paradip Refinery’s production will be mostly 
sold at the Indian domestic transportation fuel market.
E. Conclusion
45. Myanmar’s economy is expected to grow at a rate of 7.1%, which will result in an increase in 
the demand for liquid fuels – a demand which is currently covered mainly with imported 
hydrocarbons. Covering the liquid fuel needs of the growing economy with imports would negatively 
affect Myanmar’s trade balance in the future – identification of local alternatives is therefore wise. 
Some possibilities for initiating local production of both fossil and renewable based liquid fuels were 
presented in this report.
46. The first step in defining the strategy for liquid fuels is to identify what should be done with the 563
country’s existing refinery capacity. Three small refineries are currently in operation in Myanmar, but 
all three are old and their operating efficiency is low. Even if The Myanmar Petroleum Enterprise 
decides to upgrade at least one of the existing refineries, the throughput will not be sufficient to 
cover the increasing demand; hence the strategy for liquid fuels must be based on construction of 
new capacity and / or by importing. For the imports there are initial plans for a new import terminal, 
which could at a later stage support a new local refinery. However, it is believed that a small scale 
coastal refinery may not be economically feasible under the competitive pressure from large, world 
class refineries in the Middle East, India and Southeast Asia.
47. Myanmar has the right to use 50 000 bbl/day of the transfer capacity of the Sino-Burma 
pipeline, which could be used as a feedstock for a potential new refinery. Locating the refinery inland, 
adjacent to the pipeline, could result in a competitive advantage as production would be close to 
consumption which would in turn reduce transportation costs. According it is recommended to 
undertake a detailed feasibility study for a new refinery.
III. NATURAL GAS 
F. Introduction
48. Myanmar’s natural gas is in demand internationally whereas locally, Myanmar’s natural gas 
could potentially be allocated to fertilizer production, as a fuel for the production of refined petroleum 
products, to industry, to the power sector. LPG could also be produced and used as a cooking fuel. 
49. At the present time Myanmar’s proven reserves of gas are insufficient to meet the projected 
demands of all sectors of the economy. Given the relationship between GDP growth and natural gas 
supply, it is considered that Myanmar’s natural gas should be allocated to export, to fertilizer 
production and to industry. 
G. Power Sector Consumption
50. There is a role for gas in power generation, potentially supplemented by liquid fuels. The 
existing (and under construction/development) capacity for gas based power will be about 1 700 
MW within a few years, which would consume over 200 MMCFD when simultaneously in operation. 
Given the relative uncertainty surrounding hydropower development with storage capacity, as 
reserve capacity needs increase to 2030, and if gas would be used to meet this capacity need, then 
total gas consumption could reach as high as 1 000 MMCFD. This requirement for gas may not be 
able to be met through a future domestic gas quota but could instead be met by imported LNG or by 
light fuel oils. However, the cost of LNG exceeds 18 $/MMBtu and this means that LNG would be a 
very expensive solution for power generation. In principle however, power generation could 
comprise a gas plant capacity of less than 10% in 2030 if light fuel oil was used to fuel fast-acting 
reserve capacity plant. In this case, the total annual gas consumption by the power sector would be 
very modest; in 2020 only 18 BCF and in 2030 only 31 BCF. When the existing gas contracts 
governing domestic quotas expire it may be feasible to negotiate for a higher quota, or new gas 
fields may be discovered, but in the meantime, it is considered prudent to plan the expansion of the 
power sector to minimize the consumption of gas to ensure that industry needs are met. 564
H. Refinery
51. A 50 000 bblpd hydro-cracking refinery would require around 10 000 MMCF of natural gas to 
produce hydrogen and to power the refinery. This gas requirement can be much reduced by using 
an alternative refinery design that does not require hydrogen, and one that is powered using heavy 
distillates. 
52. The oil supplied to the refinery will have fractions that are gaseous (condensates) and gas will 
be produced, some of which can be used for power production and some which can be sold to 
consumers for profit. Table III-1 provides an estimate of the quantities of refined oil products that 
would be produced by a vis-breaking 50 000 bblpd refinery, expressed in energy terms. Table III-2
provides an estimate of the gas and residue fuels that could be used to power a vis-breaking refinery, 
along with the residual quantities that could be sold to consumers. The residues are of sufficient 
quantity to power a 100 MW power plant; the residues could be stored and called upon to power 
reserve gas / oil plant, or the refinery power plant could be over-sized and the additional 100 MW 
capacity could be used to supply consumers living in the vicinity of the refinery.

I. Fertilizer
53. As discussed in the Agriculture Sector demand report, the use of fertilizer in Myanmar has 
fallen to around 10 kg per hectare. Agricultural experts Naing and Kingsbury found that a fertilizer 
load of 80 kg per hectare produced significantly increased yields of all major crops including rice. 
54. A standard production run for a modern fertilizer plant is 1 725 metric tons per day. This 
equates to around 600 000 tons of fertilizer per annum. Myanmar has around 17 million hectares 
which means that the standard production run output would provide for around 35 kg per hectare.
For the purpose of evaluation of the economics of a standard fertilizer plant, a urea production 
equivalent to 35 kg per hectare has been assumed. A 70 – 80 kg per hectare production could be 
achieved with two standard run fertilizer plants, each located in the north and south of the country. 
55. Table III-3 presents an outline calculation for a standard run fertilizer plant. The plant would 
produce 1 000 mt of ammonia per day before adding water for conversion to 1 725 mt of urea. The 
natural gas requirement would be 31 mmcfd or 10 200 mmcf per annum. The investment cost would 
be $ 1.2 billion.

Urea 595 000 t/a
Gas 10 200 mmcf/a
Investment Cost 1 200 MUSD
O&M 2.5% of capital cost
56. An economic evaluation has been conducted with the objective of determining the price of 
natural gas that would result in a competitive cost for locally-produced urea. The economic 
discounting rate (real) has been assumed as 6 % and the life of the fertilizer plant as 20 years.
57. The economic evaluation shows that the price of natural gas would need to be set at no more 
than $ 6 per MMBtu if a local fertilizer plant was to be cost competitive against an international price 
for urea of around $ 350 per mt. The gas price appears to be too low if an economic value of $ 18 
per MMBtu is considered as an opportunity cost, or if the government’s current subsidized price of $ 
11.2 per MMBtu is considered. Therefore it is assumed that fertilizer would be imported rather than 
manufactured locally.
J. Industry, Commercial, Household Sector
58. Industry uses natural gas for processes that require fine control of heat, e.g. petrochemical 
production. The commercial sector uses LPG for cooking, primarily in restaurants. There is also 
production required for household use for cooking. LPG is being imported and could continue to be 
imported while natural gas is in short supply and demanded by industry.566
K. Natural Gas Supply – Demand Balance
59. The natural gas supply-demand balance takes into account the estimated production of the 
operation gas fields, based on domestic needs, and known and likely development of new gas 
fields. 
60. The Aung Thein Kha (M3) field has been planned to start production in 2019. However, in 
early 2015, the new Thai government indicated that Thailand’s dependence on Myanmar for natural 
gas has reached a comfortable limit and further purchases may not be in Thailand’s strategic 
interest. This announcement, coupled with depressed international prices for oil and gas, has led to 
public announcements by PTT Thailand that the development of the M3 field may be indefinitely 
delayed. The production of other new fields are speculative, e.g. the announced find of an Indian 
company in Block A6 (Phyithar discovery) was not accompanied by an estimate for the 
commencement operation date. 
61. Figure III-1 presents a gas supply – demand balance projection developed by JICA under 
their Electricity Masterplan. The projection includes the M3 field and other fields identified by JICA in 
the course of their study in 2014.
Figure III-1: Projection for Gas Supply (JICA 2014)
Source: JICA 2014567
Figure III-2: Projections for Natural Gas Supply & Allocation
Source: JICA 2014, Consultant’s analysis 
62. Figure III-2 provides a projection according to the worst case where the M3 and other fields 
are indefinitely delayed. The planning assumption capacity trajectory represents a capacity half way 
between JICA’s projection in Figure III-1 and the worst case trajectory. The sector demands are 
based on the electricity growth scenario developed in ADICAs Electricity Expansion plan and the 
refinery development of Section II above. Fertilizer production need for gas is included to 
understand the relationship between demand and available capacity. Whilst the planning 
assumption capacity trajectory could be considered as likely, in practice it is considered prudent to 
minimize gas consumption. This issue is further discussed below in terms of risk mitigation.
63. Unless natural gas development and consumption is managed through policy means, there is 
a real potential for significant shortages of gas within 10 years. In the past MOE has negotiated with 
gas suppliers from Thailand for additional gas supply to Myanmar. Also, as a separate development, 
MOEP has explored the possibility to purchase LNG. The principal options available therefore 
include demand-side measures, such as limiting gas supply to sectors outside power generation 
sector, or giving the industry sector high priority and the power sector priority for peaking generation 
needs. Policy measures could be used to shift from gas to liquid fuels in these sectors. 
64. On the supply side, there is a relatively high certainty of new, feasible gas finds, although 
their timing is uncertain, as well as the possibility to import gas as LNG. It has been reported that 
Yadana gas field operator has claimed ability to sell additional gas, but the offer is of course subject 
to commercial negotiation. Careful assessment of the issue and evaluation of various measures is 
needed in order to find an optimal way forward. However, planners for electricity system expansion 
cannot consider any new gas-based power plants to be built prior to 2020 – and even thereafter; 
inclusion of any substantial amount of gas-based power capacity should be subject to identifying 568
new sources of gas, either from physical gas fields or through re-negotiating some of the gas export 
deals currently in force with the neighbouring countries.

66. LNG. With regard to the identified shortage of natural gas in the short run, MOEP has 
deliberated a Feasibility Study on the LNG receiving facilities in Myanmar, which was completed in 
March 2014. The study suggested location of the Floating Storage Regasification Units (FSRU) 80 
km to south from the Yangon estuary where the sea depth is around 15m (satisfactory for the LNG 
carrier). There are three alternatives of gas pipeline landfall location; all consider gas as receiving 
terminal the South Dagon Junction. MOGE plans to extend the gas pipeline from South Dagon 
Junction to Thilawa SEZ. The purchase of the LNG was considered from LNG portfolio suppliers. 
67. Specifications of the considered facilities were as follows:
 FSRU storage capacity: 173,000 m3
 Regasification capacity: 120 mmscfd x 4 units (1 unit is spare) 
 Gas pipeline length: 80 km (offshore), 50 km (onshore) 
 Size of gas pipeline: 24 inch 
 Design of jetty: Cross jetty 
 Expected timing: 53 months from the design to LNG supply, 
including EPC 33 months 
68. The feasibility study estimated the required capital costs of the facility as follows:
 FSRU: 278 MUSD 
 Jetty: 82 MUSD 
 Offshore gas pipelines: 154 MUSD 
 Consulting fee: 15 MUSD 
 Interest during construction, etc.: 69 MUSD 
 Tax: 25.2 MUSD 
 Total: 624 MUSD 
69. Financial analysis of the project showed good results with expected LNG price of 14 
USD/MMbtu. The expected electricity tariff with LNG fuel were set at 11.3 c/kWh, which together 
with LNG facility cost of 0.8 c/kWh, would have resulted in electricity generation cost of 12.1 c/kWh.
70. Before the feasibility study, the MOEP had already started activities on the LNG development 
and related infrastructure. A tender invitation was announced in 2013 with a specification of 150 to 
200 mmscfd of LNG supplied before March 2014, and 500-600 mmcfd after 2014 for the next 5 to 10 
years period. In August 2013 MOEP selected 14 bidders qualified for the LNG purchase. YESB 
(Yangon Electricity Supply Board) has evaluated them and submitted the report to MOEP, which was 
further submitted to NEMC (National Energy Management Committee). NEMC has since then 
suspended the evaluation reports. The main challenge with the LNG project was considered the 
selection of the location of the FSRU. A commercial offer has also been submitted thereafter to the 
government, which indicated a price of approximately 18 $/mmbtu for the gas supplied from the LNG 
facility.
71. Realization of the LNG project is not clear at the moment. If there is a decision to realize this 
project, it will take a few years until its commissioned and the LNG supply begun. Also upgrade and 
rehabilitation of GT to GTCC requires some years for implementation. Therefore the use of liquid 
fuel such as light oil, crude oil and heavy fuel oil, rather than natural gas, will be needed by any 
thermal capacity that is developed in Myanmar to meet the short term power demand. The LNG 
options would be an expensive one for the electricity generation sector, and it would require 570
approximately five years to develop to production, and therefore other solutions should be identified 
and firmed up if gas based power generation is proposed.
L. Natural Gas Supply Risk Mitigation Strategy
72. There is an opportunity to manage the risks that natural gas supplies does not develop as 
anticipated. If required, fuel substitution can first be made in the transportation and agriculture 
sectors to release the capacity required to serve the industry and power sectors. However, the 
decision to develop these sectors may come ahead of the development of firm supplies of natural 
gas, in which case it can be considered as a prudent practice to minimize the use of natural gas in 
the power sector and for fertilizer production in favor of allocation to industry.

73. Clearly the gas supply – demand outlook is tight. However, the refinery design can be 
modified to minimize gas consumption. In principle the use of gas for power generation could be 
replaced by oil or storage hydropower capacity for deployment at times of peak demand. A fertilizer 
plant appears to be uneconomic and gas could be saved by importing urea. The M3 gas field will 
ease the situation considerably, through an increase in capacity, however the delay in the 
development of the field means that a prudent approach is indicated. 
74. In summary, gas could be reserved for industry and the power sector. Other demands could 
be met by alternative means. The decision to pursue alternatives can be decided as a matter of 
government policy as the natural gas supply – demand balance unfolds in the coming years.571
IV. Biofuels 
M. Introduction
75. Increasing use of biofuel in diesel engines is tried and tested in many markets including in 
Myanmar. Most current passenger cars and truck diesel vehicles are today B7 capable. The 
compatibility of large engines and heavy-duty vehicles with higher blends is better than for light duty 
vehicles. It has been estimated that about 80 % of the trucks can run safely on B30. Therefore the 
introduction of 5 to 10 % of biodiesel does not require specific actions or issues to be resolved but
fuel suppliers can increase the level of biodiesel (Fatty Acid Methyl Ester – FAME in accordance with 
international EN 14214 standard, or so called advanced biodiesels with properties almost
76. Biofuel consumption is a key indicator in many countries of the deployment of renewable 
energy in the transport sector. Fuel ethanol already accounts for nearly 10 % of the gasoline market 
in the USA and a major share in Brazil. Current European fuel standards allow up to 7 volume% in 
diesel fuel (the most common type of biodiesel, B7) and 10 volume% of ethanol (E10). 
77. Biofuel consumption is a key indicator in many countries of the deployment of renewable 
energy in the transport sector. Fuel ethanol already accounts for nearly 10 % of the gasoline market 
in the USA and a major share in Brazil. Current European fuel standards allow up to 7 volume% in 
diesel fuel (the most common type of biodiesel, B7) and 10 volume% of ethanol (E10). 
78. Myanmar is well positioned to adopt progressive policies towards renewable fuels. The 
country is endowed by suitable natural resources and has already entered into several experiments 
for domestic biofuels production. At the same time new technologies have been developed allowing 
the country to step in to applying the second generation refining technologies, which allow a wider 
range of feedstock especially for ethanol production. At the same time car manufacturers around the 
world are increasingly adapting their products to allow use of higher mixing ratios of biofuels. 
79. Biofuels considered for potential production in Myanmar include the following:-
a) Biodiesel – a diesel fuel obtained from non-edible oil plants (e.g. jatropha, rubber seeds
and edible oilseed crops (palm oil, coconut, rapeseed and soybean), through a chemical 
reaction process. Like bioethanol, also biodiesel can be used as a fuel either alone or 
blended with petroleum diesel (e.g. B20 consists of 20 % biodiesel and 80 % petroleum 
diesel);
b) Bioethanol – a substitute for gasoline produced from sugar- and starch-based crops such 
as sugarcane, cassava, paddy rice, or maize. Bioethanol could be used as a fuel either 
alone or blended with gasoline (e.g. E10 consists of 10 % ethanol and 90 % gasoline).
80. About ten years ago the Government of Myanmar introduced a biofuel implementation 
program with an aim to minimize the country’s dependence on imported liquid fuels. The program 
was based on an ambitious plan of mass cultivating approximately 200 000 ha of jatropha curcas in 
each state and division. The program included plans for blending bioethanol with conventional 
gasoline, for establishing small scale processing plants in rural areas, and for implementing projects 
on biofuel production with the assistance of the FAO and ASEAN countries. 
81. However, as there are currently no facilities capable of producing biodiesel or bioethanol in 
large scale and to the extent outlined by the Government of Myanmar at the time the biofuel 
implementation program was initiated, then it seems fair to conclude that the biofuel implementation 572
program has thus far been unsuccessful. 
82. It is understood that the cornerstone of the biofuel implementation plan – cultivation of 
jatropha – failed due to poor planning and execution, and as the planted jatropha plants did not 
deliver the yields expected, the ambitious biodiesel program was eventually discarded by the 
Myanmar Government. Today the production of biodiesel is limited to local level facilities producing 
biodiesel mainly to be used by agricultural machinery. 
83. For the time being, no support scheme has been identified for the production of biodiesel or 
bioethanol, which seemingly directly reflects the lack of new initiatives by the private sector.
84. Despite the unsuccessful implementation of the biofuel program, which is not rare because 
the global experience of domestic biofuel schemes is rather mixed, it should be kept in mind that 
Myanmar holds significant potential for liquid biofuels and they should therefore not be excluded 
from country’s energy mix. It is recommended that the lessons learned from the biofuel program and 
from the cultivation of jatropha trees are thoroughly reviewed and taken into consideration in any 
possible future project.
85. The following two sections, present more information regarding biodiesel and bioethanol, 
including some indicative calculations related to the investment cost for selected production facility 
configurations and consequent pre-feasibilities of domestic biofuel production.
N. Biodiesel
86. Increasing use of biofuel in diesel engines is tried and tested in many markets including in 
Myanmar. Most current passenger cars and truck diesel vehicles are today B7 capable. The 
compatibility of large engines and heavy-duty vehicles with higher blends is better than for light duty 
vehicles. It has been estimated that about 80 % of the trucks can run safely on B30. Therefore the 
introduction of 5 to 10 % of biodiesel does not require specific actions or issues to be resolved but
fuel suppliers can increase the level of biodiesel (Fatty Acid Methyl Ester – FAME in accordance with 
international EN 14214 standard, or so called advanced biodiesels with properties almost equal to 
petroleum diesel) without causing vehicle compatibility problems or requiring modifications to fuel 
distribution, and without significant consumer involvement.
87. Biodiesel can be produced from a myriad of different plants that can be roughly divided into 
edible and non-edible crops. The use of edible crops for biodiesel production is controversial, as this 
could impact food prices and in some cases also worsen mal-nutrition in developing countries. 
Edible crops that could be considered for biodiesel production include oil palm, coconut, groundnut, 
soybean, sesame etc. Some non-edible crops that could be considered for biodiesel production 
include jatropha curcas, castor oil plant and rubber trees. So called third generation sources of 
biodiesel such as algae are currently under development. This paper focuses mainly on the use of 
jatropha seeds for production of biodiesel due to the fact that the number of jatropha trees in 
Myanmar is assumed to be significant as a result of the national effort to plant jatropha trees 
between 2006 and 2008.
88. Jatropha growing has potentially many benefits. It can be intercropped with many other cash 
crops such as coffee, sugarcane and vegetables with the Jatropha offering both fertilizer and 
protection against livestock. Jatropha needs at least 600 mm of rain annually to thrive but it can 
survive three years of drought by dropping its leaves. Jatropha is excellent at preventing soil 
erosion, and the leaves it drops act as a soil enriching mulch.
89. The oil content of jatropha seeds is between 36 and 38 %. The plant starts to bear fruit in 4 –
5 years after planting and economic yields start from the fifth year. The seeds of jatropha are 573
non-edible and therefore production of biodiesel from jatropha seeds does not limit country’s food 
production capacity assuming jatropha is farmed on a land unsuited for farming of edible crops. It 
should however be emphasized that, as with every plant crop, the quality of the farmland, the 
amount of sunshine hours and irrigation define the annual yield. If grown on non-arable land, the 
annual yield from jatropha trees can be assumed to be between 0 and 2.2 t/ha3(0 – 800 kg/acre). 
Table II-9 presents an estimation of yields for jatropha trees of different age.

Source: Myanmar Industrial Crops Development Enterprise, Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation. The source indicates that seed yield for plats 
aged 4 – 5 years would be 4 800 kg/acre, which is assumed to be a mistake.
90. As at October 2012, Myanmar had reportedly cultivated around 2 million ha of jatropha4. 
These numbers should however be interpreted with a level of caution as several reports have 
highlighted that a significant portion of the jatropha seedlings planted under the biofuel program 
between 2006 and 2008 have failed to grow into seed-bearing trees. Assuming that the total 
cultivation area of two million hectares mentioned in several reports is correct, the biodiesel 
production potential from jatropha trees alone assuming a conservative biodiesel yield of 20 gallons 
per acre can be calculated to be:
a. 2 000 000 ha = 4 941 932 acres
b. 20 gallons/acre x 4 941 932 acres = 98 838 640 gallons
91. The estimated biodiesel production capacity potential of 100 million gallons could, if utilized, 
cover a significant portion of Myanmar’s diesel demand. However, as mentioned above, it is unclear 
if the conservative yield estimation of 20 gallons per acre reflects the actual yield from the jatropha 
trees planted under the biofuel implementation program. Whatever the current yield, 2 million 
hectares represents a significant cultivation area and if the jatropha trees planted were well tended 
in the future the annual harvest could become large enough to cover a relatively large part of the 
diesel demand especially at a rural community level.
92. It is understood that there are no large scale production facilities currently in operation or 
under construction, in Myanmar. The following jatropha processing pilot facilities were at one time in 
operation but it is unclear whether or not these plants are still in operation:-
a. Pilot production in Yangon (Myanmar Industrial Crops Development Enterprise, 
Ministry of Agriculture), output 100 gls/day;
b. Pilot jatropha crude oil expeller and processing plant, Hline Tet Farm, Myanmar 
Agricultural Service, Mandalay Division. The small demonstration plant needs six

hours to refine 100 liters of jatropha crude oil to 97 liters of refined biodiesel and cost 
ca. 50,000 USD;
c. North-eastern Military Command, Lashio, Shan State; refines 240 gals of jatropha 
crude oil per day. Estimated cost was 10 million kyats (circa 2008); and
d. Jatropha and Rubber Plantation in Man Pan Project (Hill 5), Lashio, Shan State.
93. Table IV-2 presents an outline calculation for two different sized jatropha based biodiesel 
production facilities assuming oil content of 37 % in the jatropha seeds, a yield extraction efficiency 
of 92 % and a loss of 2 % in the trans-esterification process. The press cake that is a by-product of 
the oil extraction process could be used for the production of the process steam needed for the 
process.

94. Assuming Myanmar adopted an objective of increasing use of biofuels so that diesel fuel sold
in the country consisted on average of 20 % biodiesel and 80 % petroleum diesel, the impacts of 
such policy can be estimated as follows:-
 The cost of jatropha seeds is the single most important cost factor in jatropha based biodiesel 
production representing 75 to 90 % of the production cost. There is no direct cost reference from 
Myanmar available to the Consultant, but international references from Africa, India and 
South-East Asia indicate that the price paid to the farmers have ranged between 120 to 170 $/ton 
whilst the price of the output oil ranges from 400 to 700 $/ton (September 2014). Feedstock cost 
of 170 $/ton (146,000 Kyat/ton) is therefore assumed. 
 The cost of steam generation is estimated only based on the capital cost of a solid-fuel boiler 
plant at 12 $/MWh(th) (11,700 Kyat/MWh(th)) and electricity purchase price at 95 $/MWh (93 
Kyat/kWh, representing economic long run marginal cost including generation and T&D). The 
operating costs are estimated at 3 % and 2.5 % of CAPEX for the smaller and larger facility, 
respectively. 
 The economic cost of petroleum diesel is assumed on basis on international fuel prices. For 
estimation purposes the diesel cost is set at 0.73 $/liter corresponding approximately to crude 
price of 100 $/bbl. The current pump price of diesel in Myanmar including transport and 
distributions cost is about 0.91 $/liter (890 Kyat/liter, 4,154/Kyat/gallon). 
 Petroleum diesel has net heat value of 42 MJ/kg, density of 0.8 kg/liter, and CO2 emission factor 
of 73.6 g/MJ, i.e. 2.51 kg/liter. 
 Economic discounting rate (real) is assumed at 6 % and life of the refinery at 20 years. 
95. With these assumptions for the two above plant capacities the cost of domestic biodiesel is in 
the range of 0.47 and 0.5 $/liter (584 to 628 $/ton), on average 0.48 $/liter. Therefore blending ratio 
of 20 % would results in net savings of 0.25 $ per liter of diesel. Having B20 policy would 575
subsequently result in savings of $713 million calculated as a present value of the annual costs for 
15 years until 2030. For the most part this saving would also contribute to the national trade balance 
as much of the transport fuels are is currently imported. Totally 11.9 million tons of CO2 emissions 
would be reduced. If valued at 30 $/ton of CO2 further economic savings of $ 357 million can be 
achieved.
96. B20 policy would result in the increase of biodiesel demand from 290 to 413 million litres, ie. 
64 to 91 million gallons from year 2016 to 2030. This would require correspondingly that the about 2 
million hectares (4.9 million acres), which was targeted in the mid-2000’s, would need to be brought 
again under active jatropha cultivation by 2030.
97. The above calculation is only for demonstrating that policy encouraging production and use of 
biodiesel remains desirable and seems economically and technically feasible for Myanmar. The 
calculation itself is highly sensitive to (i) feedstock price and (ii) reference price of petroleum diesel. 
Furthermore, the mixing policy would cause some economic cost on the consumer side, which is 
difficult to quantify, such as slightly increased operation and maintenance cost of the vehicle fleet in 
the event shift to B20 level be rapid and based on existing engines and fuel qualities. However, 
technological development work of car manufacturers is addressing these maintenance issues and 
selecting new materials more suited to biodiesel use than the current ones. Fast development is 
happening also on the production side, where different second and third generation biodiesel 
production methods are already entering the business. 
98. The referenced diesel price corresponds roughly to crude price of 100 $ per barrel. With 
prices of 70 $ and 130 $ per barrel, the referenced international diesel price could be estimated at 
0.51 and 0.95 $/liter respectively. With the lower level, the refinery price of biodiesel would roughly 
match the international diesel cost, whereas with the higher level, the present value of savings in the 
country’s fuel bill until 2030 would increase to $1.3 billion.
99. As mentioned earlier, international experience on developing jatropha based biofuel 
businesses is mixed, and many pilot schemes have failed. Assuming seed yield of 1 to 1.2 tons per 
acre, one acre generates 150 to 180 dollars annual income to the farmer per acre. As the sown land 
of most Myanmar farmers is 5 acres and less, introducing a less-income generating crops, such as 
jatropha, among the traditional cash crops, which provide substantially higher income, would be 
difficult. For jatropha cultivation, large scale specialized private agricultural companies, who also 
have an interest in the upstream side of the business, in production and selling biodiesel, would 
probably provide a more suited business model than small farmer or community based cultivation. 
Large private corporations should, however, address the problems encountered in the past with land 
allocation practices. Biofuels are still contested in many countries due to uncertainties surrounding 
positive environmental and social benefits, concerns about potentially negative impacts, and the 
manner with which land is acquired for these projects.
100. As significant amounts of jatropha trees have already been planted around Myanmar, it is 
recommended that it is considered, how the seeds of the jatropha trees could best be used for 
biodiesel production. If nothing is done, it seems possible that the significant national push for 
promoting the jatropha has been in vain and the planted trees might wither away. A recommended 
first step would be to identify the current state of the planted jatropha trees, the most suitable 
regions for cultivating jatropha, and the means that are available for improving the yield from the 
planted trees. Afterwards the focus should be shifted to harvesting methods and defining how the 
seeds are best processed into biodiesel and whether this should be conducted in large facilities or 
on a community level. Private sector driven and environmentally and socially sustainable business 
model for jatropha cultivation and processing should be developed.576
O. Bioethanol
101. The drive towards sustainable economy has caused the governments around the world 
introduce ambitious policies and mandatory targets for renewable fuels. This has brought ethanol to 
the fuel markets. The US and Brazil together represent around 90 % of the ethanol produced and 
consumed in the world. In Brazil, ethanol can be used as a standalone biofuel in over half of the 
country's light vehicle fleet. This is because of the widespread introduction of flex-fuel cars, which 
can run on either gasoline or ethanol or any mixture of the both. The additional price of a 
flex-fuel-vehicle currently ranges from zero to about $ 2,000 per vehicle depending on the 
manufacturer and model. This would allow the consumer side also in Myanmar follow the extending 
provision of ethanol.
102. Currently, commercial bioethanol is produced by first generation (1G) technology from sugars 
found in arable crops, which can easily be extracted using conventional technology. The second 
generation (2G) technologies use non-food ligno-cellulosic biomasses such as bamboo and are on 
the threshold of commercialization. First generation sources of bioethanol in Myanmar include crops 
such as sugarcane, cassava, maize, sweet potato, yam, sorghum and rice. Second generation 
bioethanol could be produced from non-food parts of crops already under cultivation such as stems, 
leaves and husks of maize and sugarcane as well as stems, leaves and husks of non-food crops 
such as jatropha.
103. First generation bioethanol is produced by fermenting plant-derived sugars to ethanol in 
processes similar to those used for making alcoholic beverages such as wine. Second generation 
bioethanol production is more complicated; as an example the sugars in ligno-cellulosic biomasses 
are locked within a fibrous matrix and are therefore not readily available for extraction. An important 
consideration related to the use of bioethanol blended with gasoline is the so-called “blend wall” i.e. 
blending more that 10 % of ethanol with gasoline requires the use of flex-fuel vehicles as car 
manufacturers are claiming that blends higher than 10 % have the potential to damage conventional 
vehicle engines. However, as mentioned earlier and by referencing Brazil experience, the flex-fuel 
vehicle is already today in the market allowing up to 85 % ethanol content. Modifications to fuel 
distribution infrastructure could also be needed if more than 10 % of bioethanol is blended into 
gasoline as RE85 or similar ethanol products would need to be provided dedicated pumps.
104. The current production capacity of bioethanol in Myanmar is based on first generation 
biomass, especially sugarcane and maize. In the future, production of bioethanol utilizing the 
second generation technology for extraction of bioethanol e.g. from the non-oily parts of the jatropha 
tree could be considered assuming the technology becomes more accessible.
105. Since 2002, the Myanmar Chemical Engineers Group (MCE) has constructed four plants for 
99.5 % ethanol production in Mandalay, Sagaing and Bago; their total capacity is 1.95 million 
gallons/year5. The Myanmar Economic Cooperation has furthermore built two large bioethanol 
plants with combined capacity of 1.8 million gallons/year6. Commercial production started at these 
plants in 2008. A private company Great Wall Food Stuff Industry has also built an ethanol plant (3
700 gals/day) based on sugarcane.
106. The Consultant has not come across any information indicating that any bioethanol 
production facilities have been established since 2008. Furthermore, the Consultant has discovered 
that the existing facilities are no longer producing bioethanol due to lack of legal support and 
subsidies.

107. As to maize based ethanol production, in Table IV-3 below, an outline calculation is presented 
for two different size bioethanol production facilities with an assumed moisture content of 13.5 %, 
starch content of 70 % of dry matter and ethanol yield of 50 % of the inherent starch. Similar or 
slightly higher yields could be expected if polished rice was used instead of maize.

108. Cassava could also be considered as a suitable feedstock for bioethanol production due to its 
high starch content. The following Table IV-4 presents an outline calculation for two different size 
production facilities based on cassava assuming a dry matter content of 25 %, starch content of 80 
% of the dry matter and finally ethanol yield of 50 % of the inherent starch in cassava.

facility sizes for both molasses as well as for sugarcane (sugarcane juice + molasses) in in Table 
IV-5 and Table IV-6 below. For calculation on molasses a sucrose content of 50 % and ethanol from 
sucrose efficiency of 50 % are assumed.

110. If sugarcane was to be used, process steam and electricity could be generated by 
combustion bagasse, which is a byproduct of the sugarcane production. In the future, bagasse could 
also be used as a feedstock for bioethanol production in a second generation bioethanol plant. As 
can be seen from the tables above, sugarcane can be considered as the most advantageous 
feedstock for the production of first generation bioethanol in Myanmar, especially on a larger scale. 
As with all first generation biofuels, if the production capacity of sugarcane based bioethanol is 
increased, it must be ensured that this does not result in shortages in food supply.
111. It is also recommended to study the ongoing second generation bioethanol projects (1 in 
Brazil, 1 in Italy, 3 in the USA). If a cost-competitive way for producing bioethanol from 
ligno-cellulosic materials becomes available, Myanmar could base its bioethanol production on more 
sustainable feedstocks such as maize and jatropha stover.
112. Assuming Myanmar adopted objective of shifting to a mixing standard so that all gasoline 
sold in the country would be replaced totally by gasohol consisting of 10 % ethanol and 90 % regular 
gasoline, the impacts of such policy are estimated in the following by reviewing two feedstock as an 
example, (i) sugarcane and (ii) maize.
113. The cost of feedstock is again the most important cost factor. At the moment, the sugar 
industry in Myanmar has experienced rapidly rising feedstock cost. Whilst sugarcane ton was sold at 
13,500 kyat in 2007-2008, it was sold at 30,000 kyat in 2012-2013 (31 $/ton). The current level may 
not sustain as the sugar mills compete against globally competitive prices. There are 18 sugar mills 
in the country and all of them have a capacity at or below 2,000 tons of cane per day (TCD) whereas 
a competitive facility size can be estimated at around 10,000 TCD. The two fuel refineries of Table 
IV-6 represent approximately 1000 and 3000 TCD capacities.579

paper presented to “Investing in Sustainable Agriculture in Myanmar” Yangon, July 2014
114. Maize is an internationally traded commodity. International maize price averaged about 194 
$/ton (IMF Commodity Prices) during the second and third quarters of 2014. Farmers in India sell 
maize at around 134 $/ton (800-840 rupees per 100 kg). Therefore, the reference price is set for the 
calculation at 150 $/ton (146,000 Kyat/ton).
115. The reference price for gasoline corresponding to about 100 $/bbl of crude oil price, is 0.68 
$/liter. The current pump price of gasoline in Myanmar is about 1.08 $/liter (1,050 Kyat/liter, 4,770 
Kyat/gallon). International ethanol prices, e.g. as quoted in Chicago or Rotterdam, vary more 
regionally than prices of petroleum products. The international reference price for ethanol is 
assumed at 0.71 $/liter, which roughly represents an average of Chicago and Rotterdam price 
levels. 
116. Gasoline and ethanol have different fuel properties and therefore a 10 % renewable target 
would correspond to a volume consumption, which is not divided 90/10 in liters as in E10. Gasoline 
has net heating value of 42.4 MJ/kg and density of 0.75 kg/liter. Its CO2 emission factor is 73.6 g/MJ 
equal to 2.33 kg/liter. Ethanol has net heating value of 27.0 MJ/kg, density of 0.79 kg/liter, and no 
CO2 emissions if feedstock is cultivated sustainably and/or provided from excess production.
117. The 10 % mixing ratio here is assumed in terms of fuel heating value. Because ethanol has 
lower heating value, mixing results in higher volume of fuel consumed than without mixing. However, 
several studies have shown that due to higher octane value of ethanol, this relationship is not 
directly proportional to heating values only, but some fuel volume is saved because of efficiency 
gains in vehicle engine combustion due to ethanol’s octane value. When these relationships are 
summed up, a 10 % mixing ratio is estimated to result to a liter of regular gasoline to be replaced by 
4.1 % higher volume of gasohol. With 10 % renewable energy target, the mix therefore has 85.8 % 
gasoline and 14.2 % ethanol when expressed in liters. 
118. The maize based plant concepts provide ethanol costs of 0.53 $/liter whereas sugarcane 
based refining produces ethanol at 0.55 to 0.58 $/liter, both below the international reference prices 580
for gasoline and ethanol.7 Because resulting ethanol prices are near to each other, 0.56 $/liter is 
assumed as the common price for locally produced ethanol. The contemplated biofuel policy would 
therefore result in a small net cost of $123 million to the economy calculated as a present value of 
the annual costs for 15 years until 2030. Totally 5.9 million tons of CO2 emissions would be reduced. 
The implicit cost of CO2 reduction would be 38 $/ton. Changes to the net impact to the economy 
remain small even if the crude price assumptions are let to change ± 30 $/bbl.
119. The results of bioethanol policy would be more modest than those of biodiesel policy. 
Production of domestic biodiesel seems already now more economical that diesel imports, whereas 
local ethanol is of slightly higher cost than gasoline. It should also be noted that the underlying 
demand forecast for gasoline is less than that for diesel and the assumed blending ratio is smaller. 
120. The 10 % renewable energy in gasoline policy would result to some 286 million liters (63 
million gallons) of ethanol consumed in 2030, which, if all would be produced from sugarcane, would 
require 4.4 million tons of sugarcane to be delivered for biofuel production. Today the total sown 
acres for sugarcane are 180,000 hectares with an average yield of 6.58 tons per hectare.8
Therefore 670,000 hectares would be needed for biofuels if fuel ethanol production depended solely 
on sugarcane. This calls for having a wider feedstock base and introduction of second generation 
ethanol production technologies, which can utilize agricultural waste such as leaves and stalks of 
maize, excess bagasse and ordinary straw from rice and wheat farming. 
P. Conclusion
121. In future diesel and gasoline production could be supplemented by production of biodiesel 
from oily plants and of bioethanol from starchy crops. Considering the large surface area and good 
growing conditions in Myanmar, liquid fuels produced from renewable feedstock could play a 
significant role in the supply of transportation fuels.
122. Biodiesel / bioethanol production in Myanmar is currently limited to only a few production
facilities. Existing bioethanol facilities have more or less stopped production due to lack of subsidies
and no information indicating new facilities being under construction was found. Only pilot scale 
biodiesel facilities have been built in Myanmar, which are producing small amounts of biodiesel for 
use by agricultural machinery.
123. Approximately ten years ago Myanmar began an ambitious biofuel implementation program 
with a plan to plant a total of 3.5 million hectares of jatropha curcas trees. The program was 
unsuccessful failing to live up to the expectations of making Myanmar self-sufficient as far as the 
demand for diesel goes. It is unclear, what is the estimated yield of the jatropha trees planted as part 
of the program, but considering that several reports have claimed that jatropha plantations cover an 
area of approximately 2 million hectares, the trees seem to offer a significant source of non-edible oil 
that could be used for the production of biodiesel. Other crops could also be utilized for the 
production of biodiesel, but the first step recommended to be taken is to identify the current state of 
the planted jatropha trees and the means that are available for improving the yield from these trees. 
Afterwards the focus should be shifted on harvesting methods and defining how the seeds are best 
processed into biodiesel and whether this should be conducted in large facilities or on a community 
level.

It is understood that there exists business cases where an ethanol refinery would have revenues from side products such as
fodder for animal feed. It is further realized that with second generation technologies ethanol can be produced from side products 
and agriwaste at very low feedstock price. These aspects were ignored for the simplicity of calculating the example.
8 Crop Summary in Myanmar, by Issares Thumrongthunyawong, www.bangkokbank.com.581
124. Use of bioethanol should also be considered. Sugarcane, whether used as whole or only in 
the form of molasses seems to present the most cost-effective way of producing bioethanol utilizing 
first generation production technology. The concept of blend wall, meaning in essence that 
approximately 10 % bioethanol can be blended with gasoline without the need for updating the 
vehicle fleet is coming less important as flex-fuel vehicles, either new one or retrofits, have proved a 
low-cost solution to pursue consumer side interest in bioethanol fuel.
125. Both biodiesel and bioethanol seem economically feasible for Myanmar. A biofuel policy with 
set mixing targets for 2020 and 2030 is recommended. Assuming a 10 % target for both diesel and 
gasoline by 2020, and 20 % target by 2030, transport de-carbonisation case can be developed. 
Table IV-7 below summarizes cases discussed in this report, namely base case, a small inland 
refinery case, and domestic biofuel case, and their impacts to the supply side of liquid fuels until 
2030 in Myanmar.582

I. SUMMARY 
A. Electricity Development Strategy
1. The optimal long-term fuel mix of Myanmar is determined to a significant extent by the fuel mix 
of the electricity generation sector. The selection of a fuel mix that is most suitable for electricity 
generation in Myanmar is shaped by the economic value of fuels available to Myanmar, the 
competition for fuels outside of the electricity sector, and the cost to convert fuels to electricity. 
2. These factors are particularly relevant to the consideration of Myanmar’s proven natural gas 
resource. The gas is in demand internationally whereas locally, Myanmar’s gas could potentially be 
allocated to fertilizer production, to the production of refined petroleum products, to industry, to fuel 
passenger vehicles (CNG), to the power sector, or as a cooking fuel. At the present time Myanmar’s 
proven reserves of gas are insufficient to meet the projected demands of all sectors of the economy. 
Given a basic analysis of the relationship between GDP growth and natural gas supply, it is 
considered that Myanmar’s natural gas should be allocated to export and to industry. Economic 
analysis suggests that it would be economical to import fertilizer rather than to produce fertilizer 
locally. Other needs, including power sector needs, can instead be met by liquid fuels. 
3. In principle, power generation could comprise a gas plant capacity of less than 10% in 2030. In 
this case, the total annual gas consumption by the power sector would be very modest; in 2020 only 
18 BCF and in 2030 only 31 BCF. The existing (and under construction/development) capacity for gas 
based power will be about 1 700 MW within a few years, which will consume over 300 MMCFD when 
simultaneously in operation. As reserve capacity needs increase to 2030, and if gas would be used to 
meet this capacity need, then total gas consumption could reach to around 1 000 MMCFD. This 
requirement for gas may not be able to be met through a future domestic gas quota but could instead 
be met by imported LNG or by light fuel oils. On the other hand the cost of LNG exceeds 18 $/MMBtu 
whereas the subsidized price to the current gas fired plants in Myanmar is around 5 $/MMBtu for 
domestic consumers and 11-12 $/MMBtu for industries. This cost difference means that LNG would 
be a very expensive solution for the country (whether LNG is used by the power sector or by industry). 
Therefore it is clear that it is preferable to use light fuel oil to fuel fast-acting reserve capacity plant. 
LNG imports can be considered again nearer to the time when the current gas supply contracts 
expire, if it is feasible to negotiate for a higher quota for domestic consumption. In the meantime new 
gas fields may be discovered. 
4. A set of alternative long-term fuel mixes have been examined in detail, each with a low 
dependence on natural gas. Concerns regarding seasonal variation in hydropower output have been 
addressed by analysing in detail and by modelling hydropower generation profiles on a conservative 
basis, on hourly and monthly basis. The cost of each fuel mix has been estimated, according to the 
optimal use of power generation technologies as they apply in Myanmar. These technologies extend 
from hydropower, to thermal and renewable energy forms of power generation. Whilst the focus of the 
EMP is on the optimal long-term fuel mix, it has been necessary to undertake generation sector 
expansion planning to quantify the cost of the fuel mix and also to take into account the practicability 
of implementing the optimal fuel mix strategy. 588
II. INTRODUCTION 
B. Optimal Fuel Mix Selection
5. The selection of a fuel mix that is most suitable for electricity generation in Myanmar is shaped 
by the economic value of fuels available to Myanmar, the competition for fuels outside of the electricity 
sector, and the cost to convert fuels to electricity. 
6. The fuels considered for electricity generation are hydropower, gas, coal, wind, solar PV and 
fuel oil. 
a) Gas. Myanmar’s future gas reserves are uncertain and care must be taken to make the 
most efficient use of gas for the purpose of power generation. 
b) Coal. Myanmar’s coal reserves are small in quantity and of poor calorific value. Therefore it 
is assumed that, for efficiency of conversion of coal to electricity, sub-bituminous coal would 
need to be imported. 
c) Oil. It is not a preferred practice to use oil for power production. However, the use of heavy 
and light fuel oil can be economic when used to fuel reserve power plant. Such oil is stored 
adjacent to gas / oil engines that are used under emergency conditions. If a local refinery is 
established the heavy distillates that have no other use could be used for this purpose.
d) Type I Renewables. Myanmar has abundant hydropower resources. Myanmar’s solar 
energy and wind resources are suitable for grid-connected large-scale electricity generation. 
7. Electricity technology costs and efficiency of fuel conversion is considered in detail in this 
report. Cost and performance assumptions are based on the Consultants’ extensive experience of 
Asian power plant costs and performance1
.
8. Optimization of a generation portfolio is a modern practice that relies on economic dispatching 
principles. The EMP is based on hourly economic dispatch, allowing for detailed modelling to 288 time 
periods. This level of granularity is important to capture the variable characteristics of the generation 
profiles of seasonal hydropower and intermittent renewable energy. A key planning criterion for 
electricity expansion planning is related to the security of the electricity system. Security is determined 
by the reserve capacity (spinning reserve or standby). Up until the 1990’s reserve capacity was mostly 
set on a deterministic basis as a % of installed capacity. Economists were dissatisfied with this 
approach as the spare capacity could not be valued economic terms. With the advent of advanced 
computer tools, it became feasible to compute the Loss of Load Probability (LOLP). The associated 
Expected Unserved Energy could then be valued in strict economic terms and compared to the cost to 
find the trade-off point between security and cost. However, the LOLP approach is problematic in a 
hydro-dominated system where the impact of water limitations can far outweigh power plant unit 
failures. Accordingly for the EMP the reserve margin was set on a deterministic basis, allowing for the 
seasonal variations in hydropower output based on best available hydrological data and climate 
change projections.

(PB Power HK and PB Power Singapore) and have extensive experience in costing power plant developments in Asia 
and internationally.589
III. Supply Side Options 
9. The following section considers power plant development by fuel type. Fuel price projections 
are developed and presented. Finally, classical screening curves are developed for all technology 
options deemed suitable for Myanmar over the period of the planning horizon. Screening curves 
provide a hi-level appreciation of the relationship between costs and capacity factors of different 
technologies. Such appreciation supports the development of a range of potential planting schedules 
based on policy considerations.
C. Gas. 
10. There are plans for construction of new gas power plants at various stages of development. If 
all planned projects are completed, the installed capacity of gas PPs will increase to 4,148 MW. If 
rehabilitation plans are successfully implemented, the available capacity of gas fired PPs would be 
4,514MW.

11. The capital cost of a turnkey (EPC) delivery for a gas combustion plant significantly depends on 
the power plant capacity, its location, and delivery terms. Thus, a recent (2014) feasibility study 
carried out by the consultant for a location in Kazakhstan provided with CAPEX level of about 1,500 
USD/kW for a 210 MW CCGT plant. On the other hand, a study carried out by PA Consulting Group 
for Singapore in 2010 defined CAPEX for a 423 MW CCGT plant to be only 850 USD/kW (890 
USD/kW if adjusted by inflation to 2014). This notable difference is mainly explained by the equipment 
manufacture location (delivery to Kazakhstan would have been done from Europe), long 
transportation distances, transportation means involved (both by sea and then on-land in case of 
Kazakhstan), as well as by associated technical and country risks.
12. The CAPEX assumptions used for the current analysis for Myanmar take into consideration 
higher capacity of the considered CCGT units (650 MW) but also include project contingency which 
altogether leads to an estimated cost of 918 USD/kW for a power plant operating with 80 % capacity 
factor. The fixed operating cost is assumed at 1.8 % of CAPEX, and variable operating costs (other 
than fuel costs) being 0.59 USc/kWh. Lead time for a CCGT plant is assumed to be 2.5 years.
13. Costs for an open cycle gas combustion turbine are assumed to be 486 USD/kW (CAPEX 
including contingency), 1.2 % of total CAPEX for fixed operating costs, and 0.99 USc/kWh for variable 
operating costs (other than fuel costs). Open cycle gas power plant capacity factor in this study is 10 
% (assuming that this power plant provides with capacity to cover peak loads). Lead time is assumed 
to be 1.5 years.
14. For both CCGT and open cycle power plants, low OPEX reflects low labour costs in Myanmar. 
Life time for the both types of gas power plants is set at 25 years.
D. Coal. 
15. Myanmar possesses large coal reserves (230 million ton probable and 120 million ton 
possible). The largest reserves are in Kalewa region and central east of Myanmar (Maingsat). Coals 
are accessible for extraction but due to road conditions could be difficulties for their further 
transportation. Projects for infrastructure improvement are ongoing thus this factor may be mitigated 
in the future. However, the currently identified domestic coal resources are not sufficient for 
developing coal-based electricity generation capacities in thousands of megawatts as a 1000 MW 
coal fired base load plant would consume over its life around 90 to 100 million tons.
16. Myanmar coals are not of high quality and possess low calorific values (3 200 to 6 700 kcal/kg); 
however their low sulphur contaminant allows using them for power production. Modern technologies 
allow more efficient utilization of low-quality coals’ potential.
17. A 300 MW coal-fired power unit would consume around 1 to 1.3 million tons of coal annually 
(depending on type of plant and calorific value of coal). Therefore, over the life of 30 years the coal 
supply amounts to 30 to 39 million tons. The largest coal reserve currently listed is Maingsat in Shan 591
State with a capacity of 118 Mtons of probable lignite to sub-bituminous and 4 Mtons of possible 
sub-bituminous coals. The largest deposit of sub-bituminous coals is at Kalewa in Southern Sagaing 
Division with total capacity of 87 Mtons, 5 Mtons of which are positive, 18 Mtons are probable and 65 
Mtons are possible. These reserves do not suffice for large scale power development, for example in 
the range of 1,000 MW supercritical power units, currently typical in the People’s Republic of China 
(the PRC). Therefore the development of coal based power should be carried out in synchrony with 
the mining development so that capacities of mine mouth plants are properly dimensioned to match 
the proven and probable resources.
18. There are indicators that environmental and social approaches in developing new coal-fired 
power plants projects are not completely adequate. More attention shall be paid to these issues while 
developing future power plants. Three types of coal-fired power units have been selected as 
representative for Myanmar’s future coal capacity, namely 600 MW supercritical, 150 MW circulating 
fluidized bed, and 50 MW pulverized coal fired unit. Cost and operational parameters have been 
defined for these three representative units for further analysis and expansion planning.
19. At the present time Myanmar operates only one coal-fired power plant at Tigyit. The plant is of 
120 MW installed capacity but operates at only 27 MW due to inadequate maintenance. The plans for 
its rehabilitation have not yet been approved. Data on plans for new coal-fired PPs is somewhat 
undefined. MOM and MEP have announced three projects with total installed capacity 876 MW 
(Kalewa, Yangon and Tanintharyi). 
20. MoM and MoEP have announced three projects with total installed capacity 876 MW (Kalewa, 
Yangon and Tanintharyi). The JICA 2014 study, referring to Hydropower Generation Enterprise, 
provides information for 11 projects with a total capacity of 15 GW. All projects were expected to be 
developed by the private sector by both domestic and foreign investors. Some projects included a 
provision that 50 % of the generated electricity would be exported to neighbouring countries. 
 Yangon PP (270 MW) in 2013;
 Kalewa PP (600 MW) in 2014;
 Tanintharyi (6MW) in 2015.
21. In 2014 JICA, referring to an interview with the Hydropower Generation Enterprise2 (HPGE), 
concluded that plans for expansion of the coal sector were wider – see Table III-2 for details and 
Figure III-1 for schematic representation of locations of the planned generation projects.

22. Whilst many proposed projects in have large units at a later stage, the first phases of proposed 
plants call for 25 MW, 50 MW, 135 MW, 250 MW, 300 MW and 400 MW units to be built. 593

23. The major coal based technologies that are available today globally at various stages of 
development include (i) conventional pulverized coal combustion (PC), (ii) circulating fluidized bed 
combustion (CFB), (iii) supercritical (SC) and ultra-supercritical (USC) PC combustion, and (iv) 
integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC). There are also add-on technologies that can be
combined with some or all of the mentioned technologies to improve environmental performance of 
coal combustion. Among them are carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies either as a retrofit 
to running power plants or as part of the new ones. CSS technologies have not yet been 
commercialized. 
24. There is limited experience of coal fired units in Myanmar’s power industry, and there is not a 
large scale for coal-based power foreseen in Myanmar, it is believed the choice of technologies can 
be limited to PC, SC, USC and CFB technologies. IGCC technology, whilst already demonstrated in 
several plants, is not yet fully commercial and competitive in comparison to PC technology. Not only 
that the capital cost of IGCC technology is high, the technology is perceived to involve unquantifiable 
operating risks. Furthermore, the advances in PC combustion through substantial efficiency gains 
achieved with SC and USC technologies have overall reduced interest in IGCC technology. 594
25. USC and SC plants are already commercially available, cost effective, and there is rapidly 
accumulating worldwide operational experience of them. Steam parameters of typical sub-critical 
power plants are 150 to 180 bar pressure and 540 to 565 ºC temperature; SC plants operate at 
around 245 bar pressure and 540 to 570 ºC temperatures, and USC plants have temperatures of 
around 600 ºC or higher. Supercritical pressure is reached at 221 bar, above which level water/steam 
reaches a state where there is no distinction between liquid and gaseous state. Consequently the 
boiler does not need to separate steam from water and the substance is heated in a once-through 
process.
26. The design efficiencies of USC plants are between 39% and 46%. This stands in an apparent 
contrast with the typical efficiencies of 30% to 37% of the conventional PC and CFBC technologies. 
However, it should be noted that the SC and USC technologies have not yet been designed for high 
ash and low grade coal. Therefore, large SC and USC plants can be an option primarily for large 
IPPs on the coast depending on imported bituminous or higher NCV sub-bituminous coal.
27. CFBC technology is mature and offers many benefits in Myanmar conditions. Compared to 
traditional PC technology, CFBC is less sensitive to coal quality variation, allows mixing various kinds 
of coals, and provides opportunity to low-cost solution for the reduction of SO2 and NOx emissions. It 
is believed that for Myanmar, CFBC technology is commendable in the unit capacity range below 300 
MW.
28. These considerations lead to the emergence of three types of coal-fired power units as more 
fitting with Myanmar’s future coal capacity, namely 600 MW supercritical, 150 MW circulating fluidized 
bed, and 50 MW pulverized coal fired unit. Cost and operational parameters are defined in this report 
for these three representative units for further analysis and expansion planning. 
29. The 600 MW SC unit represents future IPPs which are planned on the coast to serve both 
exports and domestic demand and rely on imported coal. The 150 MW CFBC unit represents a typical 
coal fired unit whether mine-mouth combusting low-quality lignite or IPP on the coast which is built in 
multitude of stages of 150 MW and uses either imported or locally produced coal. The 50 MW PC 
represents a typical mine-mouth unit designed for a designated coal. 
30. The capital costs assumed here range from 1300 $/kW to 2300 $/kW from the largest 600 MW 
SC plant to the smallest PC unit of 50 MW. The plant own use of electricity has been estimated to 
range from 7 % and 8 % to 10%, and plant efficiencies from 41 %, 35 % and 33 %, respectively from 
largest unit to the smallest. 
31. It should be noted that the plant capital costs vary significantly country-by-country. The cost 
levels are considerably lower in the PRC than those in OECD countries including Japan and Korea. 
IEA data from 2010 collected for SC and USC plants, so called overnight costs, which exclude 
construction time interest, and were expressed in 2008 US dollars calculated on the net capacities, 
ranged from 800 $/kW to 3,500 $/kW whilst the median cost was at around 2,100 $/kW. The costs in 
the Chinese domestic market were between 600 $/kW and 700 $/kW.
32. The cost estimates chosen here are clearly higher than the costs in China but lower than the 
median costs reported by IEA in 2010. The cost levels provided by mainly Chinese EPC contractors in 
South-East Asia have been used as a reference. There is no economy of scale in the domestic market 
of Myanmar and each project should be considered a stand-alone site. Even though some plants 
would be of standard design, Myanmar will face a local first-of-kind phenomenon, whereby project 
faces risks as to experience of local contractors and labour. With not many large projects to construct 
annually in Myanmar, there are no major domestic contractors experienced in implementing large 
subcontracts for power projects.595
33. With the above issues in mind, this study assumes gradually increasing unit costs over the 
planning period. The first power plants in the expansion plan are assumed to have lower specific costs 
than the later units of the same kind due to real-term increase of relevant raw material prices and 
labour costs.
34. Key assumptions pertaining to the power plant costs are summarized as follows:

E. Oil. 
35. The reserve plant could be fuelled by fuel oil. The engines would be capable of accepting gas 
or oil fuel. The cost of the engines would be the same as for gas engines and were discussed above 
under the Gas section.
F. Type 1 Renewables - Hydropower. 
36. The hydropower plants, which are currently under construction, are listed in Table III-4. All 
plants in the list are planned to be commissioned by end of financial year 2020/21. Out of the total 
capacity of 2,143 MW, 1,994 MW (93 %) are developed by MOEP or MOAI.
37. Overall, there is a major uncertainty with respect to project development and the timing of the 
plant commissioning. During recent years, several projects, which have started construction, have 
progressed slowly because of either financial or technical difficulties encountered during the project. 
Construction times have extended from the typical 4 to 8 years so that many projects, now under 
construction, have anticipated construction periods up to 13 years. 
38. As of July 2014, among the listed projects, the largest one, Shweli 3 of 1,050 MW, has not yet 
secured full financing although work on site has commenced with infrastructure and civil works. Debt 
financing from overseas remains open. Progress of civil works on Upper Kengtawng project has been 
impacted by fiscal limitations. Financing for Middle Paunglaung 100 MW project has not yet been 
closed. Technical concepts for the Tha Htay 111 MW project in Western Myanmar were changed 
during construction, which caused delay in the project schedule.

39. In 2012, MOEP completed an assessment of hydropower opportunities which indicated that 
there are as many as 92 potential sites for hydropower development, each having capacity greater 
than 10 MW. The MOE Energy Statistics Review of 2013 indicated that these hydro sites have been 
grouped into 60 potential hydro projects including 10 projects that are in various stages of 
development. Similarly as many as 210 sites for small and medium size plants each with capacity of 
less than 10 MW with a total potential installed capacity of 231 MW have been identified.
40. About 46 GW of new hydro capacities were planned until 2030 and beyond. Unlike earlier, 
when most of the existing plants as well of those currently under construction, belonged to MOEP or 
MOAI, major part of plants in the list for long-term development are planned to be built under a 
JV/BOT arrangement by foreign investors and domestic private entrepreneurs. 
41. During recent years private and foreign project developments in Myanmar have become 
subject to higher level of scrutiny by the public and media, and even direct opposition by various 
interest groups and stake holders. A large Myitsone dam project in Kachin state was suspended in 
2011 and is today considered as cancelled. It was part of agreements signed in 2007 with Chinese 
companies about their participation in the development of seven major hydropower projects on the 
confluence of the Ayeyarwaddy River and the Mali and the Mai Rivers in Kachin State. The total 
capacity of these developments is 13,360 MW. Two other projects from the 2012 list of MOEP
(Mawlaik, 520 MW and Belin 280 MW) have also been cancelled. 597
42. The draft National Electricity System Masterplan issued in 2014 by JICA includes a thorough 
review of the hydropower prospects and their status as of June 2013. The JICA study highlighted 
some potential concerns over the environmental and social impacts related to large dams. The study 
therefore outlined two scenarios, in which large hydropower developments were minimized and 
replaced by coal and gas fired power station respectively, and in both scenarios by increasing amount 
of small and medium size hydropower.
43. EMP Consultant requested MOEP to list prospective projects for future expansion. MOEP’s list 
of preferred hydropower opportunities are shown in Table III-5. This list of projects is used in the 
continuation as the base hydropower option for expansion planning.

44. The hydropower expansion plan excludes a number of projects included in the previous plans. 
The excluded projects are listed below. Many of those are large projects, which would involve 
mainstream dams in Myanmar’s major rives and are therefore more environmentally and socially 
sensitive than those listed above. No projects in the Chindwin river system are included. The 
exclusion of some projects, however, is not an indication that this study would have regarded them 
not-feasible or environmentally or socially controversial. The prospects should be considered to 
remain in the pipeline for the case the demand growth necessitates and government strategy calls for 
more hydropower to be developed. Should there be need to re-prioritize projects, their economic and 
social merits should be independently weighed against their possibly negative social and 
environmental impacts.

45. The base case for expansion plan has total installed capacity of 14,842 MW in 2035. The 
installed capacity to Myanmar, after the assumed 50 % export share of IPPs with foreign investments 
has been extracted, is 10,690 MW. Major part of the new hydropower schemes are located in the 
Shan State and include that electricity is exported to Thailand or China. Most new schemes in the 
Kachin State are developed in partnerships with Chinese companies. Major hydropower schemes not 
having an assumed export obligation include Shweli 3 (1,050 MW), which is under construction, 
Middle Yeywa (320 MW) and Mangton (225 MW) in the Shan State, Bawgata (160 MW) in the Bago 
Division, and Taninthayi (600 MW) in the South of Myanmar.

46. The availability of hydropower capacity was considered carefully in light of MoEP concerns 
regarding the constraints on hydropower in the dry season. Seasonal production of each plant, 
capacity factors and available hydrological data were considered in establishing hourly, daily and 
monthly production profiles. Moreover the impact of solar PV resources in supporting storage of water 
during the day time in reservoir schemes, particularly in the dry season, was considered. The 
hydropower profiles developed for the purpose of expansion planning are shown for the wet and dry 
seasons in the following table and figures:

G. Type 1 Renewables - Solar PV 
47. The PV technology in utility-level applications can be divided to classes roughly by two 
important technical parameters. One is whether the project uses crystalline-silicon (c-SI) modules or 
amorphous Si thin film modules. The second dimension is whether or not the modules are mounted at 
a fixed-tilt or on a tracking system. Due to mass production and fierce competition typical residential 605
PV systems based on crystalline-silicon (c-SI) modules challenge well the amorphous Si thin film 
modules, which used to be more common and economical in earlier utility scale applications from 
2005 to 2010. The system costs have since then converged. 
48. As to the tracking system, it represents an additional cost but provides a higher energy yield. 
One-axis tracking, although it increases capital costs by 10 % to 20 %, can be economically attractive 
because of the increase in energy-production (20 % to 30 % more kWh/kW/year in areas with a good 
solar resource).3
49. A recent study by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the USA gathered cost and price 
data for 202 utility-scale (i.e. ground-mounted and larger than 2 MW) solar projects in the USA 
totalling more than 1,735 MWAC, of which 194 representing 1,544 MWAC consisted of PV projects.4
Important observations were made on recent cost trends. The clear convergence in the average price 
of c-Si and thin-film projects was observed. The development is due to declined price of silicon 
combined with global excess of c-Si module manufacturing capacity. The economies of scale appear 
to diminish considerably when the system capacity goes beyond 5-10 MW. Overall, the system prices 
had fallen from around 5,600 $/kW of the period of 2007-2009 to 3,900 $/kWh on average for projects 
completed in 2012. Anecdotal evidence was given about cost reductions continuing to 2013-2014 to 
the extent that a large US project had reported an installed price of 2,030 $/kW to the regulator.
50. The operation and maintenance (O&M) costs reported in the USA appear to be in the range of 
20 to 40 $/kW, or 10-20 $/MWh. These represent approximately 0.5 % to 1 % of the installed capital 
cost annually. The O&M costs are related to module cleaning, panel repairs and replacements, 
vegetation control, maintenance of mounting structures, and maintenance of the power system 
covering inverters, transformers, switchgear, internal wiring and grid connection. Part of the 
maintenance is labour intensive and therefore lower costs can be assumed in Myanmar than the US 
reference.
51. A Memorandum of Understanding was recently signed between MOEP and US investors of a 
solar PV project to Myanmar. The project consists of two 150 MW facilities, one in Nabuai and the 
other in Wundwin, both locations in Mandalay Region. The published project cost is 480 m$, equal to 
1,600 $/kW. The targeted commissioning of the project is in 2016. Also a Thai company has been 
pursuing a 50 MW solar power plant in Minbu in Magway Region.
52. The cost assumptions made here are 2,100 $/kW for a solar PV plant operating on average at 
20 % capacity factor. The capacity factor is highly site and project technology specific, including 
whether or not the project uses tracking devices. The operation cost is assumed at 0.4 % of CAPEX 
reflecting low labour cost of Myanmar.
53. Another solar power technology is Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) that uses mirrors to focus 
sunlight to either vertical pipes (parabolic troughs) or to a single point tank (solar tower), in which heat 
transfer fluid, typically water or oil, is heated and led further to evaporate steam for an ordinary 
thermal power process. This technology allows heat storage and scale, which is suitable for utility 
operations, typically from 50 to 100 MW. There are competing technological development lines for 
CSP including parabolic trough, tower systems, linear Fresnel and dish Stirling. 
54. A CSP plant with the heat storage provides the benefit of higher dispatchability than a PV plant,

States, Authors: Mark Bolinger and Samantha Weaver, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the USA, September

albeit at higher capital costs typically over 5,000 $/kW. With thermal storages CSP plants can extend 
power supply to the evening hours, which are often also peak hours of the system. However, as 
Myanmar’s power system is dominated by hydropower, this feature is of lesser importance. As 
mentioned earlier, hydropower can be used for hourly-level regulation so that the energy supplied by 
solar systems during day-time can be effectively stored by the hydropower system and utilized in the 
evening. Therefore, CSP technology is not considered prospective in Myanmar over the planning 
period of this study.
H. Type 1 Renewables - Wind 
55. Global wind power has also seen a substantial reduction in initial capital costs of wind farms. 
There has been continuous up scaling in the unit sizes of wind turbines so that the current standard in 
many European markets seems to be around 3 MW. Another major factor in cost reductions has been 
that Chinese and Indian turbine manufacturers have consolidated their place in the international 
market place. Around half of the wind turbine cost is in the installation and farm infrastructure. They 
include grid connection costs, farm internal power network, track and crane pad, foundation survey, 
design and ground works. In these areas, the low cost of labour has some significance to the costs. In 
this study, grid-connected wind onshore in about 100 MW class will be assumed to operate at a 
capacity factor of 30 %, and the CAPEX is assumed at 1,360 $/kW, OPEX at 0.8 % of CAPEX 
annually and the project lead time in two years.

57. Growth rates for fuel prices are based on Current Policies Scenario forecast in World Energy 
Outlook 2013 prepared by the International Energy Agency (IEA). It is assumed that crude oil and coal 
prices will continue to grow over the following 11 years, while natural gas price will decline during the 
next 6 years but thereafter the prices would start to moderately recover (see the table below). 
Electricity price is expected to grow over the whole forecast horizon.
58. The assumed gas price has been based on the Japan Liquefied Natural Gas Import Price 
(Ycharts 2010 to 2013), with subtraction of 5 USD/MMbtu for LNG gasification, regasification and 
transport costs that are not relevant for Myanmar’s domestic gas consumers. This reference price is 
used as a proxy of the economic value of domestic gas and it reflects well the realized export prices of 
the same periods. The gas price forecast from 2014 to 2030 has been based on the IEA forecasts (on 
reduction of the gas price by 13 % till 2020, and its further recovery at 3.4 % during every five years). 
The base gas price and results of the forecasts are presented in the Figure III-10 below in two units for 
reader’s convenience.608

59. IEA sees that coal demand trends diverge across regions. Growth in coal production over 
2011-2035 comes mainly from non-OECD countries, with India, Indonesia and China accounting for 
90 % of incremental coal output. Whilst the three countries are all major producers, they are also the 
large consumers with India and China using vast majority of own coal domestically. Australia is the 
principal OECD country with higher production, and therefore price references have been sought from 
Australian coal which is traded throughout South-East Asian region. Coal resources will not be a 
constraint for many decades, yet the cost of supply is likely to increase moderately in real terms as a 
result of rising mining and transportation costs as well as forecast tightening supply/demand balance. 
The Current Policies Scenario of IEA does not reflect any measures which would limit the use of coal, 
other than those measures and policy trends that are already visible.
60. Whilst the New Policies Scenario has coal prices to grow in real terms approximately 10 % 
from the current levels to 2035, the so called 450 Scenario, which is most determined with respect of 
climate change mitigation efforts, sees 25 % reduction in coal prices under the pressure of declining 
demand. It is considered here, however, that the Current Policies Scenario, which extends the 
currently prevailing global trends, and has an in-built assumption of increased coal consumption which 
causes increasing prices, is a conservative assumption for a country that would depend on coal 
imports, if it were to decide to enter the path of building substantial amounts of coal based electricity 
generation capacity. The reference is made to this scenario only as a matter of prudency, and the 
choice does not in any way reflect the Consultant’s views on desired future development.609

J. Technology Screening
61. For the purpose of technology screening curve analysis, selected generation assets were 
divided into two groups, so-called large and small power plants. This division is somewhat relative and 
is not always based on installed capacities scale but rather on what can be considered “large” or 
“small” for a particular generation technology.
62. The screening curves presented in the following figures reflect range of capacity factors 
assumed to be realistic for the selected power generation technologies. Solid part of each screening 
curve represents a highly probable (“guaranteed”) capacity factor range, while dashed part of the 
curve represents less probable capacity factor still achievable under given technologic and economic 
conditions.
63. Large scale power plants cover large oil/gas and coal combustion plants, as well as large hydro 
and on-shore wind. All selected large-scale power plants except the solar PV can assume 
construction of both transmission and distribution facilities, including 220 kV overhead double circuit 
lines and 220/132kV substations. The table below contains main features of the considered large 
power plants. 
64. The following graphs show the estimated levelised costs of main large scale power generation 
options as a function of capacity factor. The large scale hydro, on the lower level, and the small & 
medium size hydro on the higher level, can be considered to represent a range for hydropower costs 
as there is a major uncertainty, and case by case dependence on site specific conditions, of hydro 
project capital costs. Whilst large scale hydropower delivers the lowest LCOE, supercritical coal 
based power reaches the same level if it is run as base load plant with annual capacity factor 
exceeding 80 %. 610

65. The LCOE of generation is the lowest with large scale hydro (3.62 c/kWh), but the cost is also 
dependent on capacity factor (assumed here at 50 %) and capital cost (1,700 $/kW). The costs of coal 
based power vary rather little as the higher CAPEX and OPEX of smaller CFB and PC plants is offset 
by correspondingly lower cost of lignite and sub-bituminous coal versus bituminous coal of 
supercritical large coal plant. With the current value of natural gas, assumed here to the level of gas 
exported to Thailand, gas-firing base load is not feasible compared to hydro and coal. The F-class 
GTCC plant selected as representative of gas combined cycle technology delivers LCOE of 8.58 
c/kWh.

66. The underlying assumptions for all coal fired technologies above was use of imported coal, 
which is largely justified. However, there is domestic coal available albeit not in very large amounts 
supporting large scale mine-mouth power plants. Whilst the cost of imported coal is set here to vary 
between 40 $ and 90 $/ton, is can be assumed that cost of mine-mouth generation could be based on 
coal prices varying between 10 and 20 $/ton, depending on coal quality. With such low level of coal 
cost, mine-mouth power generation seems feasible, especially, if the mine and its associated facilities 
would consume major part of generated power whereby there would be less marginal need to 
strengthen electricity transmission and substation systems. The following graph compares the costs 
of large scale hydro and bituminous coal power plant to small-medium scale lignite fired power plants.613

67. Transmission and distribution makes up an important part of the total cost of the power supply 
system, but the cost impact can be only roughly estimated in a screening analysis, and such is 
inevitably based on averages for illustration only rather than actual costs, which are highly site 
specific. A logical location for a gas turbine peaking plant is close to the load centre and in the vicinity 
of major transmission lines, and therefore this production type is estimated to have the smallest 
requirement for transmission development. These power plants are used only periodically, short 
periods at a time and their site areas are limited so that suitable sites are usually not difficult to identify 
insofar as noise abatement issues are adequately considered. Large thermal plants (coal and CCGT) 
are assumed to be located in coastal locations in Myanmar, not in immediate vicinity of major 
population centres, but optimized to be not too far from the transmission system and source of fuel 
(coal by sea and gas pipeline). Location of a large coal fired plant has specific requirements related to 
access to seaborne transportation of coal and the construction of jetty. 
68. Longest transmission distances can be expected for wind and hydropower. Likely locations for 
wind are in the South of Myanmar and not very near to the major transmission lines. Hydropower sites 
in the Shan State and the Kachin State, may be remote from the perspective of current national load 
centre, but once hydropower construction in these region starts, several plants are planned to the 
same area and to the same river system, sometimes in cascades, so that the share attributable to one 
single plant of the transmission system development remains limited. The modelled capacity for 
photovoltaic power is 5 MW, which is already a large plant of that type, but in reality it is possible that 
PV will be developed in even larger units if sparsely inhabited land is available and taken into use, and 
panels are clustered to form a large single entity up to tens of megawatts requiring HV transmission. 
Therefore 30 km of 132 kV line has also been assumed for PV of 100 MW capacity.614
69. Assumptions for the transmission system of the various types of large scale power plants in the 
META model are as presented in the following table.

70. The inclusion of the transmission and distribution cost does not have an impact on the ranking 
order of generation technologies. The distribution cost of the delivered energy is the same for all 
options, and it also has the highest share within all T&D costs. The distribution cost is 3.18 c/kWh. 
High voltage (HV) transmission and substation costs are minor, only 0.07c/kWh and 0.07 c/kWh, 
respectively, for large hydro. The share of HV transmission and substation is so small, about 4 % of 
the LCOE that despite minor differences in those between different plant options, they will not 
differentiate various generation types.
71. One possible policy option for Myanmar is to develop strongly a hydropower based power 
supply system. However, with hydropower, large ‘extra’ capacity is needed for peaking purposes. 
Hydropower is highly capital intensive and it would not be rational to build hydro capacity to such level 
that every peak could be covered considering rare adverse hydrological events and droughts. The 
following screening curve shows that gas turbine peaking power is the least cost option up to the 
capacity factor of around 10 % representing about 900 operational hours a year in average. Open 
cycle gas turbine is of low CAPEX – high OPEX type. It seems reasonable to include this technology 
option in system expansion planning when hydropower provides the base and medium load.615

72. Since 2010, the costs of both solar PV and wind technologies have declined significantly with 
increasing numbers of installations globally. One of the main contributing factors to PV power 
generation growth has been the sharp reduction in the cost of crystalline silicon PV modules. Their 
prices have fallen by more than 65 % in the past three years to less than 1,000 $/kW. Whilst the 
worldwide cumulative installed capacity of wind still exceed that of solar PV, in 2013, for the first time, 
solar installations exceeded wind albeit by a narrow margin. The massive investments in wind energy 
installations in China and India have caused these countries to develop own design capability and 
manufacturing base for wind turbines bringing competition in technology to a new level.
73. With the given assumptions the LCOE of PV technology is 10.24 c/kWh. LCOE of wind energy 
is 5.2 c/kWh, almost equal to that of coal fired power. For the solar PV, technology improvement over 
years (annual 2% decrease of CAPEX) has been taken into consideration in META.616

74. Small-scale island power plants do not assume construction of any transmission infrastructure 
but their downside is poorer service quality, which means that some technologies can provide 
electricity to consumers only part time of the day, and that electricity supply is dependent on natural
forces (river discharge, wind, solar). With the exception of a small diesel generator, all selected 
small-scale technologies below are based on renewable energy. The main features of the considered 
small power plants are presented in the following table.617

75. As can be seen from the figures below, major share of delivered energy costs for small power 
plants consists of generation costs. Solar PV, and especially PV-wind hybrid plants have significantly 
higher unit delivered energy costs when compared to other selected options. Diesel and onshore wind 
unit costs are almost equal. Biogas and mini hydro are the most attractive. It is worth noticing that 
these power plants also have significantly higher installed capacity when compared to the most 
expensive options (respectively 5 MW vs. not more than 0.1 MW).

76. Graph 1 above represents the costs of small-scale units suitable for a village level system; 
whereas Graph 2 shows costs of systems designed more for individual households. The screening 
curve analysis for small-scale power plants indicates that under given conditions, a micro PV-wind
hybrid plant is the most expensive generation option. Even a small diesel plant is less expensive until 
its capacity factor starts to exceed 70%. The least expensive generation options in this group are mini 
hydro, micro hydro and landfill biogas (the last two having practically similar unit costs). Pico hydro 618
mini and mini solar PV have mid-level unit costs. Onshore micro wind starts to be more attractive than 
e.g. diesel power only if its capacity factor exceeds 40%.

77. A screening curve method based on the Model for Electricity Technology Assessment (META) 
was applied for generic analysis and illustration of the costs of various electricity generation 
technologies in Myanmar. The analysis gave the following guidance:
 Myanmar’s power sector today relies heavily on hydropower. Hydropower is likely to provide the 
least-cost option for further system expansion. 
 Next in cost-based ranking order come large scale coal-fired power and wind energy. The 
underlying assumption for coal power plants was that they are built on the coast and depend on 
imported coal sourced from Australia or Indonesia. 
 The LCoE of small scale mine-mouth coal fired power is 1.5 - 2.5 c/kWh higher than that of large 
scale coal when lignite is valued at word market prices whereas if lignite is valued at domestic cost 
at mines, it would be 1.0 - 1.5 c/kWh cheaper, but still higher than the LCoE of large hydropower. 
 Of the new forms of renewable energy, wind energy is currently most cost-competitive and feasible 
for utility-scale application. 
 Because Myanmar has the opportunity to sell natural gas to her neighbouring countries, natural 
gas was valued at market prices valid in South-East Asia. At such fuel cost, power generation of in 
CCGT plants is relatively costly and not feasible on economic grounds for Myanmar. 619
 Open-cycle gas turbines provide a low capital cost alternative to build fast-reacting capacity for 
serving the peak loads. Such plants are feasible and should be dimensioned so that their annual 
capacity factor is approximately 10 %. 620
IV. POWER SUBSECTOR EXPANSION 
K. Introduction
78. Commercial energy planning software such as MARKAL / TIMES and MESSAGE has the 
functionality to produce a power section expansion with acceptable accuracy for long-term planning 
purpose. However, due to the concerns on historical data, bespoke planning models emulating 
MARKAL / TIMES methodology were used to model the economic and household sectors. In the case 
of power sector expansion, ADICA used software WASP (in Appendix 4) and the Consultant used an 
optimization model.
5 The Consultant’s optimization model used a deterministic approach, a 
pseudo-reserve margin was set at 15% of demand, and alternative long-term fuel mixes were 
examined using a least-cost hourly dispatch optimization technique. The methodology and approach 
is explained in more detail in Appendix A. 
79. Five expansion cases were defined based on a practical consideration of available resources, 
recent policy direction and the advice of the Ministry of Electric Power. The five cases were chosen to 
represent the widest possible spread of fuel mixes. The definitions of the five cases are given in Table 
IV-1. Capacity planting schedules were developed for each case and the portfolios were dispatched
according to marginal cost considerations with a variable operating cost merit order as follows – solar 
PV, wind, large hydropower, small hydropower small, gas and coal. 
Table IV-1: Fuel Mix Cases
Case Name Description
Case 1 Planned Hydro / 
Coal
Includes all committed and planned hydro, existing coal and gas fired 
generation, committed 300 MW solar PV starting from 2016, and 
moderate large coal expansion starting from 2026
Case 2 Balanced (Hydro / 
Coal / Solar PV)
Same as the Base Case but with less planned hydro displaced by a 
balance of large thermal resources and solar PV resource (the solar PV 
balances the hydropower)
Case 3 Maximum Hydro
Same as the Base Case but with maximum dependence on hydropower 
(including existing, committed and planned resources – the latter to the 
maximum technically-feasible) and no new thermal capacity
Case 4 Maximum Coal Same as the Base Case but without planned hydro (only existing and 
committed) and with large scale coal-fired power development
Case 5
Maximum Solar PV 
/ Wind
Same as the Base Case but with large scale solar PV and wind 
development
 
5 The model was based on a public domain OpenSolver using the Open Source, COIN-OR CBC optimization engine, 
designed to rapidly solve large Linear and Integer problems621
80. In mid-2015, the ADB commissioned ADICA6to develop a least-cost power subsector 
expansion using probabilistic expansion planning techniques (WASP software). ADICA set a minimum 
reserve margin of 20% and settled on different planning assumptions. As the ADICA report did not 
quantify energy conversion losses, the least-cost capacity expansion plan produced by WASP was 
modelled by the EMP team to determine the energy content of the fuel and the energy conversion 
losses based on EMP fuel calorific values and conversion efficiency factors.
L. Electricity Fuel Mix & Conversion Efficiency (TPES)
81. The following charts provide the outputs for the five fuel mix cases. In each case, a pair of 
charts represents the primary energy fuel use and the useful energy and energy conversion losses 
respectively. In all cases the projections are for the medium electricity growth case defined in the 
Consolidated Demand Forecasts report of this EMP.

82. The preceding charts show that if fossil fuel use and energy efficiency (thermal losses) were 
considered as the key determinants of an optimal expansion plan then Case 3 would be the optimal 
expansion due to the large amount of hydropower capacity. The lowest efficiency expansion is Case 4 
due to a high dependence on coal. The expansion plan defined by ADICA shows a fuel consumption 
and energy conversion efficiency falling between Case 3 and Case 4. The ADICA case is stated by 
ADICA as the least-cost expansion; given current technology costs, there is an evident trade-off 
between cost and thermal efficiency.
M. Portfolio Analyses (5 Cases)
83. Table IV-2 provides a summary of key performance indicators, for the 5 cases examined by the 
EMP team. The planning horizon spans from 2015 to 2035; 20 years is the minimum planning horizon 
considered acceptable for a Present Value comparison given that power plants are long-lived assets.
ADICA did not provide an expansion plan to 2035 and cost assumptions differed, and so the ADICA 
expansion plan was not included in the portfolio analyses.

partial value function range. Table IV-4 provides the normalized scores (with 100 being the best score, 
and 0 being the worst).

it is found that Case 2 – the balanced portfolio is the most attractive option. The capacity mix for each 
case is shown for year 2030 by Figure IV-13.

O. Long-Run Marginal Cost
89. Case 2 was run against a high electricity growth scenario wherein the electricity growth was 
that provided in the Consolidated Demand Forecasts report of this EMP. Figure IV-14 shows a 
comparison between the installed capacity in 2030 for the medium growth and high growth cases.
90. Using Case 2 as the basis for computation, comparing the incremental investment and capacity 
needs for the medium- and high-growth Case 2, the long-run marginal cost (2015 to 2030) is 
computed to be $ 1 200 per kW. If the out-turn growth was in line with the high growth case, the total 
additional Capex from 2015 to 2030 would be $ 6 B (real terms) or $ 400 M per annum.633

APPENDIX A: Methodology & Approach for EMP Expansion Planning
Long-Term Fuel Mix Optimization Model 
An optimization model was used to identify the optimal long-term fuel mix. The model comprises three 
modules: 1) An Economic Dispatch Model; 2) A Portfolio Analysis Model; and 3) a Portfolio 
Prioritization & Ranking Model (a Multi-Criteria Decision Model).
Economic Dispatch Model 
The Economic Dispatch Model takes technical inputs for power plants (as energy pools) and 
computes the optimal plant dispatch that minimizes fuel costs. Fuel cost optimization is determined 
primarily by heat rate considerations. However, the maximum capacity available from each pool acts 
as a constraint. The model produces the generated MWh and reports the peak MW produced by each 
energy type. 
The schema of the Economic Dispatch model is shown by Figure A1 and A2:

Figure A2: Economic Dispatch Modeling Process

Portfolio Analysis Model 
The Portfolio Analysis Model computes the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCoE) for a portfolio of 
generation assets. The levelised cost of energy (LCoE) is the total discounted unit cost of power 
generation over the asset lifetime, and includes CAPEX, fixed and variable O&M costs, fuel costs, and 
the option to include environmental costs. 
The capital investment (CAPEX) for each generation asset type has been determined as the 
‘overnight’ capital costs which include costs of equipment, construction, installation and engineering, 
but excludes interest during construction (IDC). IDC is calculated as a separate cost item and is based 
on a predetermined cost of debt. 
The Model calculates CAPEX, fixed and variable O&M costs as well as decommissioning costs based 
on initial values for the base year (2014) and respective profiles over the calculation horizon. The 
CAPEX profile takes into consideration both price escalation reflecting changes in raw material and 
labour costs over the period, as well as change of unit CAPEX costs related to generation unit size. 
Fixed O&M and decommissioning costs are defined as shares of the CAPEX.
The Model supports evaluation of three CO2 price scenarios: zero levy, flat price of 30 USD/ton, and 
price increase over the calculation time horizon (from 8.07 USD/ton in 2014 to 30 USD/ton in 2035). 
The price increase scenario is used for final ranking of the portfolios according to their LCoE levels.
The Model supports the evaluation of asset portfolio investment using a deterministic approach based 660
on the most likely expenditure and price values, or by including uncertainties related to price and cost 
levels and their future developments. This is achieved by introducing additional expert-based 
estimates of possible minimum and maximum boundaries for unit CAPEX and fuel growth rates. The 
expected CAPEX and price values are estimated using Monte Carlo simulation for beta-binomial 
(PERT) distribution.
The Model calculates the present value of total portfolio costs at 4%, 6% and 8% real discount rates. 
Real prices of 2014 are used throughout the whole calculation chain (both for the input and output 
data).
Figure A3: Portfolio Analysis Model 
Source: Consultant’s analysis
It has been assumed that 40% of the total investment program expenditures will be financed with 
equity, the cost of equity being equal to 10%. The remainder is assumed to be financed with long-term 
loans, the cost of debt being 3.3%. This rate is also used for calculating IDC.
Base year values for CAPEX, OPEX, fuel prices and discrete fuel price change rates for each 5-year 
period over the calculation horizon are based on the Model for Electricity Technology Assessments 
(META)8
. Using the META data, the portfolio evaluation model calculates smoothed price curves for 
crude oil, natural gas, bituminous and sub-bituminous coal, and lignite fuels.
Assumptions for unit CAPEX and fuel price change rates used for deterministic and probabilistic

evaluation are presented in the tables below. The US dollar is the base currency of the portfolio 
evaluation model. All input and output costs and prices are expressed in real US dollar terms for 2014.

Portfolio Prioritization & Ranking Model 
A Multi-criteria Decision Making process has been used to prioritize and rank the alternative cases. 
Prioritization is applied according to weighted policy objectives. The policy performance is scored and 
partial value functions applied to normalize the scores. 
Figure A4: Portfolio Prioritization & Ranking Model 
Source: Consultant’s analysis
For the purpose of scoring the cases, the performance measures are as follows:-
 The cost of the plan is determined as the present value total operating cost. This cost is 
normalised by indexing against the cost of the lowest cost plan. 
 The emissions factor is determined as the total cost of CO2, Nox, Sox and particulates. 
 Dependence on gas is determined as the installed capacity of gas-fuelled plant as a percentage of 
the total installed capacity. 
 Project development risk is scored for each case, weighted by the MW of installed capacity for the 
generation technologies employed. 
Some further elaboration of project development risks is necessary. One of the key risks relates to the 
learning curve associated with the use of a new technology in a new environment. An obvious 
example is the introduction of large solar PV farms in Myanmar. Such risks would be further elevated if 
two technologies were to be introduced at the same time, e.g. solar PV farms and large wind farms.
The following table provides a risk assessment of project risk factors including the scores associated 
with various technology choices, where the scoring is related to the use of the technology in Myanmar.663

The raw scores determined as the abovementioned performance measures, cannot be added directly 
as the policy factors are of different nature. The raw scores are weighted by policy weighting factors 
as follows:-
 Cost of plan – Weighting 50%; 
 Emissions – Weighting 20%; 
 Diversification (dependence on gas) – Weighting 25%; and 
 Project Development Risk – Weighting 5%. 
Again the weighted scores cannot be added directly. It is first required to normalize the weighted 
scores using a ‘value preference’ approach. The values are determined separately for each policy 
factor and normalized using partial value functions. 
The weighting of the project development risk factors by MW of installed capacity is given for each 
case as follows:

 APPENDIX A – Energy Balance Projections 2012 – 2030 (IEA format)672
I. SUMMARY 
A. Introduction
1. The EMP includes projections for Total Primary Energy Production (TPEP), Total Primary 
Energy Supply (TPES) and for Total Final Energy Consumption (TFEC)1. 
 The TFEC is the Total Final Energy Consumption. This represents the consumption by end-use 
sectors, agriculture, transport, industry, commerce / government and residential. 
 The TPES is the Total Primary Energy Supply. This represents the TFEC plus the addition of 
locally supplied energy. 
 The TPEP is the Total Primary Energy Production. This represents the TPES plus the addition of 
energy exports less energy imports. 
2. Whilst care has been taken to develop an historical energy balance and to make projections 
using the 2012 balance as a baseline, it must be noted that projections are by their nature speculative. 
They represent one possible future amongst many. Therefore it is most important to define
assumptions regarding sources of energy in the future since any deficit in the local energy supply 
capacity would made up by import. In this regard the key assumptions to note are:
 All electricity needs can be met by local power plants, however bituminous coals would be 
imported for all new power plants2
 A local oil refinery of 50 000 bopd will commence operation in 2019 
 The M3 field will be delayed indefinitely, with no new fields commencing operation during the 
planning horizon 
 Fertilizer will be imported from 2018 (consistent with the Liquid & Gaseous Fuel Strategy report); 
and
 LPG will be fully imported from 2018 (consistent with the Liquid & Gaseous Fuel Strategy report) 
 Biofuels are potentially viable but not considered for substitution during the energy outlook period 
B. Energy Balance Projection to 2030
3. Table I-1 to Table I-2 is given as an Energy Balance projection for Myanmar to 2030. This 
Energy Balance projection is based on the abovementioned assumptions. Moreover, because Saudi 
Arabian crude oil is transported across the country, with an allowance of 50 000 bopd provided to 
Myanmar, it is only the allowance that appears in the Energy Balance. Unlike oil exports, gas exports 
to Thailand and China appear in the energy balance because the gas is produced in Myanmar. Finally 
hydropower electricity produced by Chinese merchant hydropower plants, and exported directly to 
China, is not included in the Energy Balance.
4. The Energy Balance predicts that Myanmar will become a net importer of energy (slightly) by 
2030 if no new gas fields export gas abroad. As mentioned the projection assumes that the M3 field 
will be indefinitely delayed; this is due to the recent change in government policy in Thailand and the 
weak international market for oil and gas.
 
1 3. The formulation used for the development of energy projections and Energy Balance is that of the IEA. The 
rules regarding the classification of forms of energy is given by the IEA’s Energy Statistics Manual (2005).

“Energy related CO2 emissions” specifically means CO2 from the combustion of the fossil fuel components of 
TPES (i.e. coal and coal products, crude oil and derived products and natural gas), while CO2 emissions from the 
remaining components of TPES (i.e. electricity from hydro, other renewables and nuclear) are zero. Emissions 
from the combustion of biomass-derived fuels are not included, in accordance with the IPCC greenhouse gas 
inventory methodology. TPES, by definition, excludes international marine bunkers. Units in million tons (Mtons).677
C. Total Supply & Demand Outlook
5. An Energy Balance was constructed from the EMP using a bottom up method. Surveys were 
used to capture energy consumption and production data in as rigorous a manner as possible. The 
Energy Balance was projected on a three-year basis from 2012 to 2030. 
6. The forecast is shown by Figure I-1. The forecast matches with the energy projections 
presented as Table I-1 to Table I-4. It can be observed that local production capacity (TPES) rises to 
create a healthy margin over TFEC. TPEP falls as gas production and export reduces to the point 
where Myanmar becomes a net importer of energy (slightly).

7. Figure I-2 and Figure I-3 show the fuel mix composition for the TPES in 2015 and 2030. It can 
be seen clearly that the composition of the fuel mix could change dramatically over a 15 year period, 
due in particular to the growth in electricity displacing the use of fuelwood for household cooking in 
rural areas. Other changes are related to the growth in demand for passenger and freight services. 
Also the increased use of coal for power production after 2020.678

8. The sections that follow describe first the Total Primary Energy Production outlook before 
proceeding to the Primary Energy Supply outlook. The fundamental driver of the production and 
supply outlook is Total Final Energy Consumption. The forecasts for Total Final Energy Consumption 
were developed in detail in the EMP Consolidated Demand forecasts report.679

9. In the case of electricity, the Consultant has assumed that all local electricity needs will be met 
by local power plants. Electricity that is currently produced by hydropower schemes dedicated for 
export to China is not considered as part of an IEA energy balance since Myanmar neither produces 
nor consumes any part of the plant output. It has been assumed that no further electricity export will 
take place during the planning period to 2030, in other words it has been assumed that Myanmar will 
not build large hydropower schemes or any other power plants specifically for electricity trade. 
10. Under the optimal expansion, defined by the ADB as the ADICA electricity expansion in the 
Electricity Strategy report, electricity output shares would change in favour of coal, i.e. the electricity 
asset portfolio would become more balanced in terms of the fuel mix. The dominance of hydropower 
would reduce to around 57% from its current level of 65%. The dependence on natural gas will also 
reduce as expected when gas is used to meet peak demand. Electricity losses will increase as load 
increases and as coal-fired power plants are introduced. The conversion efficiency of large coal plants 
is of the order of 43% and so conversion losses increase in proportion to the amount of coal used for 
electricity generation. The increase can be mitigated to some extent if T&D losses can be reduced.
11. In the case of oil, the Consultant has assumed that a local refinery will be constructed by 2019. 
The capacity will initially be 50 000 bpd. The projection for refined oil products suggests that additional 
capacity of 50 000 bpd will be required by 2024. Nevertheless in most years it will be necessary to 
import oil. It has been assumed that LPG will be totally imported from 2020.

12. In the case of natural gas the Consultant has assumed that the M3 field will be indefinitely 
delayed and no new gas fields will commence operation during the period of the planning horizon. 
This represents a worst case scenario with a tight gas supply – demand outlook. However, as was 
discussed in the Liquid & Gaseous Fuel Strategy report there is an opportunity to manage the risks 
that natural gas supplies does not develop as anticipated. 680

Total (50,000) (137)
Source: Consultant’s analysis 
13. The refinery design can be modified to minimize gas consumption. In principle the use of gas 
for power generation could be replaced by oil or storage hydropower capacity for deployment at times 
of peak demand. A fertilizer plant appears to be uneconomic and gas could be saved by importing 
urea. These measures have been assumed ahead of the development of an LNG terminal because 
the cost of LNG will be high and market acceptance may therefore be low. 
14. In the case of coal, the Consultant has assumed that all coal used to power large coal-fired 
plants (in coastal locations) will be imported bituminous coal of high calorific value. Industrial need for 
coal will be met mainly with indigenous coal. 
15. In the case of fuelwood, the Consultant has assumed that primary energy production is 
equivalent to primary secondary energy production. There was insufficient data available to quantify 
fuelwood losses arising between forests and distribution centres. Furthermore the conversion losses 
associated with the burning of fuelwood has not been accounted for in the energy balance – such 
losses are important from an energy efficiency standpoint, but from an energy balance perspective 
they occur within consumer premises and are therefore ignored.
E. Total Primary Energy Supply (TPES)
16. The primary energy forecast for Myanmar is given by Figure I-5. It can be seen that as a result 
of rural electrification, the use of biomass type II falls with time. The growth in electricity in particular
replaces the need to produce and consume fuelwood thereby easing pressure on Myanmar’s forests. 
Oil, gas and coal production requirements increase with economic development. 681

21. The primary energy forecast for Myanmar’s Type II biofuel (fuel woods including firewood, 
charcoal and woody biomass) is given by Figure I-13. It can be seen that as a result of rural 
electrification, the use of fuelwood falls with time. This growth pattern is based on an assumption that 
the delivered price of electricity in rural areas will be sufficiently low that electricity substitutes widely 
for the use of fuelwood for cooking. The corresponding compound annual growth rates are given in

F. Secondary Energy
22. The secondary energy forms considered are electricity and refined oil products. The secondary 
energy is equivalent to primary energy net of conversion losses. However, conversion losses in 
consumer’s premises are not included in the projections. 
23. The energy forecast for electricity for Myanmar is given by Figure I-15. It can be seen that as a 
result of rural electrification, electricity use increases substantially. The growth in electricity replaces 
the need to produce and consume fuelwood thereby easing pressure on Myanmar’s forests. The 
production of by all forms of generation gradually increases over time as the population grows and the 
economy further develops. The corresponding compound annual growth rates are given in Table I-11.689

24. The secondary energy forecast for refined oil products is given by Figure I-17. It can be seen 
that the production of refined oil products increases strongly as demand grows due to economic 
development. The efficiency of the oil refining sector will increase with a new refinery. If one refinery of 
50 000 bopd is built, then imports will be required above this limit. The corresponding compound 
annual growth rates are given in Table I-12.

II. IEA ENERGY BALANCE RECONCILIATION 
G. Historical Trend 
26. The IEA has tracked Myanmar’s Energy Balance since at least 1998. The Consultant 
understands that the Energy Balance has been formulated each year based on reports provided by 
the Ministry of Energy. Figure II-1 shows the reported trend in TPEP, TPES and TFEC for the years 
2000 to 2011.
Figure II-1: Historical IEA Energy Balance
Source: Consultant’s analysis
27. In addition a comparison has been prepared showing the sent-out electricity generation 
reported by the IEA and by the ADB. There are clearly some discrepancies, most notably in the last 
few years.
Figure II-2: Historical Electricity Generation (IEA, ADB)
Source: Consultant’s analysis693
28. An Energy Balance was constructed from the EMP using a bottom up method. Surveys were 
used to capture energy consumption and production data in as rigorous a manner as possible. The 
Energy Balance was projected on a three-year basis from 2012 to 2030. 
29. The forecast is shown by Figure II-3. The forecast matches with the energy projections 
presented as Table I-1 to Table I-4. It can be observed that local production capacity (TPES) rises to 
create a healthy margin over TFEC. TPEP falls as gas production and export reduces.
Figure II-3: Energy Balance Projection to 2030
Source: Consultant’s analysis
30. It can be seen from Figure II-3 that the IEA Energy Balance and EMP Energy Balance show a 
smooth extrapolation across the 2012 boundary point. The full set of Energy Balance tables for years 
2012, then 2015, 2018, 2021, 2024, 2027 and 2030 is provided as Appendix A to this report. The 
Energy Balance tables are provided in IEA format.
31. Sent-out electricity generation has also been forecast and is shown here against the historical 
figures. It can be seen that electricity generation rises at a substantial rate due to anticipated rural 
electrification. It can also be seen that the projection is smoothly in line with the historical figures 
reported by the IEA and the ADB. The noticeable fall in the growth rate of electricity in 2021 is due to 
the introduction of a large hydropower plant with associated reduction in conversion losses. 694

III. ELECTRICITY 
H. Electricity – Total Primary Energy Production
32. The Consultant has assumed that all local electricity needs will be met by local power plants. 
Electricity that is currently produced by hydropower schemes dedicated for export to China is not 
considered as part of an IEA energy balance since Myanmar neither produces nor consumes any part 
of the plant output. It has been assumed that no further electricity export will take place during the 
planning period to 2030, in other words it has been assumed that Myanmar will not build large 
hydropower schemes or any other power plants specifically for electricity trade.

33. Under the optimal expansion, defined as the ADICA expansion, electricity output shares would
change in favour of coal, i.e. the electricity asset portfolio would become more balanced in terms of 
the fuel mix. The dominance of hydropower would reduce to around 56% from its current level of 72%. 
The dependence on natural gas will also reduce as expected when gas is used to meet peak demand. 
Electricity losses will increase as load increases and as coal-fired power plants are introduced. The

some extent if T&D losses can be reduced.
34. The export capacity of hydropower was not quantified in ADICA’s expansion plan. The capacity 
is given for Case 2 in Figure III-1. However, the associated energy has not been included in the 
Energy Balance since the plants are owned by Chinese and supply China.

V. NATURAL GAS 
L. Natural Gas – Total Primary Energy Production
41. The Consultant has assumed that the M3 field will be indefinitely delayed and no new gas fields 
will commence operation during the period of the planning horizon. This represents a worst case 
scenario with a tight gas supply – demand outlook. However, as was discussed in the Liquid & 
Gaseous Fuel Strategy report there is an opportunity to manage the risks that natural gas supplies 
does not develop as anticipated.

42. The refinery design can be modified to minimize gas consumption. In principle the use of gas 
for power generation could be replaced by oil or storage hydropower capacity for deployment at times 
of peak demand. A fertilizer plant appears to be uneconomic and gas could be saved by importing 
urea. These measures have been assumed ahead of the development of an LNG terminal because 
the cost of LNG will be high and market acceptance may therefore be low.
M. Natural Gas – Primary Energy Supply Outlook
43. Natural gas production requirements are expected to rise significantly mainly due to industrial 
sector demand. The compound annual growth rates of Table V-2 show this clearly.705

VI. COAL 
N. Introduction 
46. Myanmar possesses large coal reserves (230 million ton probable and 120 million ton possible). 
The largest reserves are in Kalewa region and central east of Myanmar (Maingsat). Coals are 
accessible for extraction but due to road conditions could be difficulties for their further transportation. 
Projects for infrastructure improvement are ongoing thus this factor may be mitigated in the future. 
However, the currently identified domestic coal resources are not sufficient for developing coal-based 
electricity generation capacities in thousands of megawatts as a 1000 MW coal fired base load plant 
would consume over its life around 90 to 100 million tons.
47. In 2013 Myanmar produced 790 thousand tons of coal and the production is likely to grow in 
the future. The government estimates production growth at 40% annually till 2030 in order to meet the 
growing demand. The growth of demand for coal in Myanmar can be linked to: (i) growing demand in 
pyro-metallurgical industry; (ii) plans to construct new coal-fired power plants; (iii) replacement of 
firewood with coal in order to prevent deforestation.
48. Myanmar coals are not of high quality and possess low calorific values (3200 to 6700 kcal/kg); 
however their low sulphur contaminant allows using them for power production. Modern technologies 
allow more efficient utilization of low-quality coals’ potential.
O. Power
49. At present Myanmar operates only one coal-fired power plant at Tigyit. The plant is of 120 MW 
installed capacity but operates only 27 MW due to inadequate maintenance. The plans for its 
rehabilitation have not yet been approved. 
50. Data on plans for new coal-fired PPs is somewhat undefined. MOM and MEP have announced 
three projects with total installed capacity 876 MW (Kalewa, Yangon and Tanintharyi). JICA study 
referring to Hydropower Generation Enterprise provide information of about 11 projects with a total 
capacity of 15 GW. All projects are developed by the private sector by both domestic and foreign 
investors. Some projects include that 50 % of the generated electricity will be exported to 
neighbouring countries. 
51. There are indicators that environmental and social approaches in developing new coal-fired 
power plants projects are not completely adequate. More attention shall be paid to these issues while 
developing future power plants. Three types of coal-fired power units have been selected as 
representative for Myanmar’s future coal capacity, namely 600 MW supercritical, 150 MW circulating 
fluidized bed, and 50 MW pulverized coal fired unit. Cost and operational parameters have been 
defined for these three representative units for further analysis and expansion planning.
52. Apart from limitations due to available infrastructure, another issue to be considered is the 
rather limited capacity of the mines. A 300 MW coal-fired power unit would consume around 1 to 1.3 
million tons of coal annually (depending on type of plant and calorific value of coal). Therefore, over 
the life of 30 years the coal supply amounts to 30 to 39 million tons. The largest coal reserve currently 
listed is Maingsat in Shan State with a capacity of 118 Mtons of probable lignite to sub-bituminous and 
4 Mtons of possible sub-bituminous coals. The largest deposit of sub-bituminous coals is at Kalewa in 710
Southern Sagaing Division with total capacity of 87 Mtons, 5 Mtons of which are positive, 18 Mtons 
are probable and 65 Mtons are possible. These reserves do not suffice for large scale power 
development, for example in the range of 1,000 MW supercritical power units, currently typical in the 
People’s Republic of China (the PRC). Therefore the development of coal based power should be 
carried out in synchrony with the mining development so that capacities of mine mouth plants are 
properly dimensioned to match the proven and probable resources.
53. The power generation sector supply requirement for coal was defined by the ADICA power 
sector expansion as follows:-
P. Industry Sector
54. The industry sector demands raw coal for industrial furnace applications. This may be phased 
out in time if more gas is available to industry.
Q. Coal – Total Primary Energy Production
55. The Consultant has assumed that all coal used to power large coal-fired plants (in coastal 
locations) will be imported bituminous coal of high calorific value. Industrial need for coal will be met 
mainly with indigenous coal.
R. Coal – Primary Energy Supply Outlook
56. Coal production requirements are expected to rise significantly mainly due to power generation 
demand. However, it is anticipated the sub-bituminous coal will be imported. The compound annual 
growth rates of Table VI-1 show this clearly.

VII. RENEWABLES (TYPE II) 
S. Introduction
58. Type I renewables include hydropower, solar power and wind power. These renewables were 
discussed in the electricity production section above. Type II renewables include biomass and biofuels. 
Solid biomass in the form of fuelwood and woody agricultural residues is the most used fuel in 
Myanmar by far, due to the dominance of the fuel in household cooking in rural areas. 
59. Biofuels have been trialed in Myanmar with poor results. The production of bioethanol and 
biodiesel is discussed further, albeit there is sufficient uncertainty that these fuels have not been 
included in the energy projections.
T. Fuelwood – Total Primary Energy Production
60. The Consultant has assumed that primary energy production is equivalent to primary 
secondary energy production. There was insufficient data available to quantify fuelwood losses arising 
between forests and distribution centres. Furthermore the conversion losses associated with the 
burning of fuelwood has not been accounted for in the energy balance – such losses are important 
from an energy efficiency standpoint, but from an energy balance perspective they occur within 
consumer premises and are therefore ignored.
U. Fuelwood – Primary Energy Supply Outlook
61. The projection for fuelwood is shown in Figure VII-1. The chart shows a significant decline in 
fuelwood production needs, easing pressure on Myanmar’s forests. The reduction is due to the 
substitution of fuelwood by electricity for the purpose of household cooking.

I. SUMMARY 
1. An important aspect of any Energy Master Plan (EMP) is to ensure that the process is 
supported by an appropriate institutional framework. Establishing such a framework is key to the 
long-term viability of the EMP as it is necessary to monitor, update and refine the EMP over time. 
2. The formation of the National Energy Committee (NEMC) represents a commitment to the 
concept of integrated energy planning. Integrated Energy Planning (IEP) takes into account plans 
relating to transport, agriculture, electricity, industry, petroleum, water supply, trade, macroeconomic 
infrastructure development, housing, air quality management, greenhouse gas mitigation within the 
energy sector and integrated development plans of local and provincial authorities. The IEP needs to 
inform and be informed by plans across all sectors (primary, secondary and tertiary) whose plans 
impact on or are impacted by the EMP. 
3. This report discusses the key concepts of IEP including benefits and barriers for establishing a 
set of institutional arrangements that can support it on an ongoing basis. The report identifies a 
number of critical factors in the implementation of an EMP process. 
4. We review the present governance structure in place for Myanmar’s energy sector and draw 
upon international experience before commenting on: 
 Institutional and regulatory impediments to collecting energy information and preparing the 
long-term outlook, and 
 Improvements necessary in the institutional and regulatory framework to support the 
function of integrated energy planning in the Ministry of Energy (MOE). 
5. For completeness, we also present the outcomes of a review of the approaches taken for the 
implementation of IEP in a number of selected countries with a view to identifying and benefiting from 
the experience gained and lessons learned.
6. Our recommendations are made for the three facets of the IEP process:
 Organisational structure and allocation of responsibilities. 
 Defining of the IEP / EMP process within the recommended organisational structure. 
 Human capacity requirements. 
7. We discuss the key recommendations of each in turn.
IEP organisational structure and allocation of responsibilities 
8. We recommend establishing of a permanent and specialist IEP team within the existing 
governance structure at NEMC, and allocating the roles and duties of the concerned IEP team, the 
ministries and NEMC in a way that can support the IEP process.
9. The ministries will be represented by ministry specialist advisors who will feed into the IEP 
team critical information relevant to the ministries that each present. The ministerial provisions of 
information could include macroeconomic policy options, sectoral strategic development plans and 
primary resource assessments.
10. The IEP team would be responsible for the key activities within the IEP process such as 
compilation of energy statistics, definition of planning criteria and targets, and performance of 
Integrated Energy Modelling.730
11. The IEP team can be structured as a specialised energy planning entity with a director of 
energy planning, an energy planning division, an energy statistics division, and a ministry advisory 
team (ministry specialists).
12. NEMC, as a Planning Commission, would be responsible for ratification of projections of 
estimated future energy needs in support of macroeconomic and socio-economic requirements, and 
recommend energy policy to support the preferred path.
IEP / EMP process 
13. The IEP / EMP is recommended to be carried out on a 5 year cycle. Typical components of any 
IEP implementation should include data collection; data compilation, analysis and statistical reporting; 
energy demand forecasting; energy supply forecasting; developing an overall strategy; and monitoring 
and evaluation.
Human capacity requirements 
14. The IEP team are required to have a set of specific skills to undertake the different components 
in the energy planning task. The team members should have knowledge and practical expertise to 
autonomously complete undertakings in energy statistics, energy demand forecasting, and energy 
supply modelling. The energy modellers perform a crucial part of the task and are expected to 
possess multidiscipline expertise covering engineering, economics and finance.731
II. INTEGRATED ENERGY PLANNING 
A. Integrated Energy Planning Process 
1. An EMP must be based on sound research on the national energy consumption trends, 
existing and potential energy supplies, energy prices, supply and demand-side technologies, 
population growth, environmental and social impacts, and political situation of a country. It is critical 
to understand the importance that IEP enables informed decisions to be made in terms of energy 
policy; robust research into the present context and assessing numerous scenarios allows for more 
informed and robust decision-making. 
2. The basic features of integrated energy planning are similar to those of the current energy 
planning and environmental planning practices, including integrated assessment, life-cycle 
assessment and integrated resource planning. However, IEP is unique because it mainly focuses on 
issues relating to energy extraction, transportation, transmission, distribution and use. The planning 
can be multifaceted, including economic, environmental, social or institutional aspects.
3. IEP is the methodology for developing a roadmap to both satisfy the energy needs of a nation
as well as to stimulate the development of economic activity. These are defined and outlined by the 
EMP. IEP must deal with issues relating to the supply, transformation, transport, storage of and 
demand for energy in a way that accounts for:-
 Security of supply; 
 Economically available energy resources; 
 Affordability; 
 Universal access to energy; 
 Social equity; 
 Employment; 
 Environment; 
 International commitments; 
 Consumer protection; and 
 Contribution of energy supply to socioeconomic development. 
4. The IEP approach differs from strategic supply planning because it includes not only the costs 
incurred by the individual/organisation, but also societal costs and other externalities, such as 
environmental impact mitigation necessitated by some resource choices. 
5. It involves making an integrated assessment of supply and demand-side options of increasing 
energy services, whilst attempting to minimise all costs subject to a set of assumptions made over the 
planning horizon. The end result – the EMP, is a flexible plan that allows for uncertainty and 
adjustment in response to changing circumstances. 732
B. Stages and Implementation of IEP 
6. An approach to IEP is illustrated in Figure II-1.
Figure II-1: Integrated Energy Planning Process 
Source: Consultant 
7. The following are the main stages of the IEP process:-
A. Macroeconomic and policy framework – a clear specification of the country’s 
objectives and economic policies; 
B. Energy forecasts – developing energy forecasts into the future based on assessments 
of the energy requirements attributable to different end-users – industrial, commercial, 
residential sector, agriculture sector and transport sector. 
C. Supply side technologies and resources – developing estimates of primary energy 
resource potentials, and feasible energy supply-side technology options; 
D. Supply-side expansion planning and costing – determine the costing of the supply side 
expansion options and develop a sequence of investments that can best satisfy 
projected energy requirements, usually a least-cost approach is preferred (subject to 
various constraints that reflect the physical limits of the energy conversion chain and 
policy objectives); and 
E. Multi-criteria scenario assessment – which involves ranking a set of EMP scenarios 
based on a set of criteria that are reflective of priorities suitable for the country. This 
type of approach is appropriate when one attempts to satisfy multiple objectives, as is 
the case in the EMP. 
C. Critical Issues for an IEP Framework to Address 
8. The IEP process needs to inform and be informed by plans for specific subsectors. It also

needs to be aligned with the broader strategic and economic direction of the country. With this, 
comes the potential for there to be some overlaps and/or inconsistencies between an EMP and the 
plans developed by other government agencies. For example, “master plans” and/or “roadmaps” for 
the economy, industry, power, gas and oil, electrification, transport, forestry and agriculture, renewable 
energy, energy efficiency, coal, greenhouse gas mitigation and others, are often developed in 
isolation. 
9. An IEP also needs to be designed as a process that can support continuous refinement and 
adaption. While EMP scenarios can be devised to span a range of scenarios to overcome 
uncertainty, invariably, new issues emerge, unforeseen events evolve and lessons are learned. The 
IEP must therefore be institutionalised and implemented in such a way that it can be updated and 
evolve over time. 
10. Importantly in the fast-changing landscape of energy technology, IEP needs to be 
technologically neutral, provide equal treatment of demand-side options including end-use efficiency 
improvements and demand-side management (DSM) and supply side options. This means that 
deferred or avoided end-use energy consumption needs to be recognised. 
11. The IEP must be supported by an organisational structure that is able to accommodate diverse, 
yet specialised capability that can collectively undertake. 
12. Issues that need to be addressed as part of IEP implementation and development of the 
associated institutional arrangements needs to address:- 
A. Defining objectives and scopes for each of formal planning study that avoid overlap. 
B. Defining interfaces or formal processes of data exchange between planning studies. 
For example, submission of data or key policy parameters by one entity for use in the 
IEP process and/or the use of IEP outputs as an input into other planning processes. 
C. Setting in place an appropriate organisational structure that enables the IEP to be 
informed by the specialist knowledge across all subsectors it seeks to coordinate. 
D. Introduce processes to identify and rectify inconsistencies between and/or to seek 
consistency between certain assumptions. 
E. Process that enables some level of refinement. 
F. Setting some level of precedence and/or ordering between plans. 
G. Incorporating a process to support change and also updating.
H. Staffing the agency responsible for IEP with people who have the capacity and 
knowledge to undertake the different components of the IEP. 734
III. REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE IN IEP 
13. This section provides a review of the energy planning frameworks implemented in a number of 
selected countries. We have reviewed these frameworks in order to identify the aspects that have 
work well and identify any useful organisational structures that could be applied to the Myanmar 
context.
D. Thailand 
Institutional arrangements for energy policy and planning 
14. The highest authority in terms of energy policy in Thailand is the National Energy Policy 
Council (NEPC) which sits directly under the Cabinet and the Prime Minister. 
15. NEPC has the following powers and duties:
 To submit the National Energy Policy and the National Management and Development 
Plan to the Council of Ministers Development Plan to the Council of Ministers; 
 To lay down rules and conditions for prescribing the price of energy in accordance with the 
National Energy Policy and the National Energy Management and Development Plan; 
 To monitor, supervise, coordinate, support and expedite the operations of all committees 
with the powers and duties related to energy, government agencies, state enterprises and 
the private sector related to energy, ensuring their operations are in accordance with the 
National Energy Policy and the National Management and Development Plan; 
 To evaluate the results of the implementation of the National Energy Policy and the 
National Management and Development Plan; and 
 To perform other functions as entrusted by the Prime Minister or the Council of Ministers. 
16. Administratively placed under the NEPC, the Ministry of Energy Ministry of energy is 
responsible for implementing the mission in providing, developing, and managing energy suitably and 
effectively for sustainable economic and social development. The MOE entrusts the planning and 
regulating functions to subordinate agencies including the Energy Policy and Planning Office (EPPO), 
the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) and the Energy Regulatory Commission. 
Figure III-1 below depicts an institutional hierarchy in relation to policy and planning decision making 
in Thailand’s energy sector. 735

Energy Policy and Planning Office (EPPO) 
17. EPPO is a pivotal agency in the formulation and administration of energy policies and planning 
for the national sustainability. This agency has a mission to study, to analyse the policies and energy 
management and development plans of the country, to coordinate, monitor and evaluate the 
implementation and outcomes pursuant to energy policies and energy plans. EPPO has the 
following responsibilities:
 Recommend energy policies and integrate/review energy management plans of the 
country; 
 Recommend national strategies for energy conservation and alternative energy promotion; 
 Recommend measures to solve and prevent oil shortage in both short and long terms; 
 Supervise, monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of national energy policy and energy 
management plans; 
 Administer the information and communication technology with regard to energy issues of 
the country; and 
 Enhance EPPO to become a strategic organisation. 
18. One of EPPO key functions is to formulate energy policies and administer energy planning of 
the country.
19. EPPO has five key divisions: (1) Petroleum and Petrochemical Policy Bureau, (2) Power Policy 
Bureau, (3) Energy Policy and Planning Bureau, (4) Energy Conservation and (5) Renewable Energy 
Policy Bureau and Energy Forecast and Information Technology Centre (Figure III-2).

EGAT 
20. EGAT’s main responsibilities are:-
 Power production. EGAT is a government-owned power producer owning and operating 
power plants with a total installed capacity over 15,000 MW, or about 46% of the entire 
generation system; 
 Owner and operator of Thailand’s high voltage transmission network. 
 Undertake the role of single buyer in Thailand’s “Single Buyer” electricity supply model. 
Specific responsibilities are: (1) purchasing bulk electricity from private power producers 
and neighbouring countries, and (2) selling wholesale electric energy to two distributing 
authorities and a small number of direct industrial customers as well as neighbouring 
utilities.
Energy Regulatory Commission 
21. The responsibilities of the Energy Regulatory Commission are: 
 Regulate electricity tariffs; 
 Administer licencing schemes for energy activities (electricity and gas licences); 
 Approval of power purchase agreements; and 
 Providing a platform to management disputes. 
The Energy Master Planning Process

period 2015-2035. The energy master plan is intended to integrate a number of other plans, including: 
Power Development Plan, the forecasts of the country's oil and gas consumption, the Energy 
Efficiency Development Plan and the Alternative (Renewable) Energy Development Plan. The energy 
master planning process in Thailand involves the six steps that are shown in Figure III-3.

Thailand Power Development Plan
23. The national Power Development Plan is developed by EGAT within the framework of the 
Ministry of Energy’s policies. EGAT, which also manages and operates the state-owned generation 
and transmission assets, formulated the last such plan for the period of 2010-2030, known as PDP
2010. Compared to the previous PDP 2007, PDP 2010 had a greater focus on renewable energy
integration. 
24. The plan was first approved by the NEPC and the Cabinet in November, 2010. Following the 
Fukushima incident in Japan, the plan has been twice revised, as Thailand’s approach to harnessing 
nuclear energy had to be revisited. The third and current (as of March 2013) revision was approved 
by the Cabinet in June, 2012. The plans have been used to guide planning and construction of 
EGAT’s new power plants, power purchases from independent power producers (IPPs), small power 738
producers (SPPs) and neighbouring countries, as well as transmission system development to 
accommodate these new power capacities.
25. The main strategies that the PDP 2010 focused on were:-
 Security and adequacy of the power system, following the policies of the Ministry of Energy 
on environmental concerns; 
 Promotion of energy efficiency and renewable energy to be in line with the Energy 
Efficiency Development Plan (“EEDP 2011-2030”) and the Alternative Energy 
Development Plan (“AEDP 2012-2021”); and 
 Promotion of cogeneration systems for efficient electricity generation. 
E. Pakistan 
Ministries Governing the Energy Sector 
26. In Pakistan, two ministries oversee different parts of the country’s energy industry. The Ministry 
of Water and Power is responsible for policies in electricity sector including alternative and renewable 
energy. The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources is in charge of the oil, gas and coal sectors. 
Planning Commission 
27. The Pakistan Planning Commission (PPC) is a government agency attached to the Ministry of 
Planning, Development and Reform. The Prime Minister is the Chairman of Planning Commission 
which apart from the minister as Deputy Chairman, comprises of nine Members including Secretary, 
Planning & Development Division / Member Coordination, Chief Economist, Director, Pakistan 
Institute of Development Economics, Executive Director, Implementation and Monitoring, and 
Members for Social Sectors, Science and Technology, Energy, Infrastructure, and Food and 
Agriculture.
28. The strategies of PPC are:-
 Preparing the National Plan and review and evaluating its implementation; 
 Formulating annual development plans; 
 Monitoring and evaluating implementation of major development projects and programs; 
 Stimulating preparation of sound projects in regions and sectors lacking adequate portfolio; 
 Continuously evaluating the economic situation and coordinate economic policies; and 
 Organising research and analytical studies for economic decision making. 
Energy Expert Groups for Integrated Energy Plan 
29. The Economic Advisory Council was set up by the Government of Pakistan under the umbrella 
of the Ministry for Finance, and mandated an Energy Expert Group (EEG) to prepare an Integrated 
Energy Plan which would provide a short, medium and long term strategy. The EEG is chaired by a 
member of the Economic Advisory Council and has representatives who hold senior management 
positions at energy companies.
30. In March 2009 the EEG developed the first integrated energy plan for the period 2009-2022. 739
The purpose of the integrated energy plan is to provide a roadmap for Pakistan to achieve greater 
energy self-sufficiency by pursuing policies that are sustainable, provide for energy security and 
conservation, and are environmentally friendly. The practical goal is to meet the demand for energy 
needs of all sectors in a sustainable manner at competitive prices with a greater reliance on 
indigenous resources. A focus group was set up under the EEG to undertake the task of collating, 
digesting, integrating and articulating the work of the various sectoral study groups which included:-
 Exploration and production; 
 Natural gas and LNG; 
 Oil (including refining, OMC, liquefied petroleum gas, and ethanol); 
 Power (hydro, thermal, transmission and distribution); 
 Coal; 
 Alternative and renewable (wind, solar, mini-hydro, biomass, biodiesel); and 
 Nuclear.

Recommendation on the Creation of National Energy Authority 
32. As part of the integrated energy plan, the EEG recommended the creation of a National Energy 
Authority for streamlining decision making and planning processes in Pakistan’s Energy sector. This 
recommendation was primarily based on the view of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) that there 
appeared to be confusion about the proper decision making authorities in terms of additional 
generation capacity (one example). The two main ministries related to energy, Water and Power, and 
Petroleum and Natural Resources do not necessarily have a collective and integrated country, 
regional or world view. For an integrated approach on energy, a single Ministry/Authority would be 
needed to address this issue. 
33. To date, the recommendation to create a National Energy Authority has not been implemented.
The Integrated Energy Model
34. In 2011, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided a technical assistance (TA) to Pakistan’s 
Planning Commission to assist the Government of Pakistan in developing an integrated energy 
system planning model for the entire sector. This so called Integrated Energy Model (IEM) would 
encompass resource supplies, refineries and power plants, transmission and distributions systems for 
fuels and electricity and the end-use devices. The IEM objective is to assess the impacts of various 
options and strategies for meeting the country's future energy needs in an optimal manner.
35. The IEM followed the same planning structure as depicted in Figure III-4. The international 
consultant selected for this TA was International Resources Group. Domestic agencies who took part 
in the planning team for the IEM development included:
 The Planning Commission; 
 Global Change Impact Studies Centre; 
 Hydrocarbon Development Institute of Pakistan; 
 National Transport Research Centre; 
 Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission; 
 Pakistan Electric and Power Company; 
 Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences; 
 Pakistan Institute of Development Economics; 
 University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore; and 
 University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila. 
36. The IEM employed the MARKAL/TIMES modelling framework. In particular, it utilised the TIME 
model generator, which is the successor to the MARKAL framework, and the VErsatile Data Analyst 
(VEDA).
37. The Pakistan IEM reference Scenario produced the following results for the year 2030:
 82,000 MW of new power generation capacity to be added; 
 Four-times increase in electricity generation from 94,000 GWh to 410,000 GWh; and 
 Three-times increase in consumption of high value petroleum products from 6.2 Mtoe to 18 
Mtoe. 
38. As part in the IEM, recommendations were made for establishing an institutional structure for a 
sustainable implementation of IEM MARKAL/TIMES modelling capacity in future. The 741
recommendations included:
 Create of a dedicated Planning Unit overseen by the Planning Commission to manage and 
coordinate modelling activities in Pakistan; 
 Recruit highly capable individuals to the Planning Unit who have an engineering or 
economics background; 
 Set up the model at several different institutions where it is likely to be used (e.g. agencies 
participating in the IEM planning team); 
 Produce annual or biannual energy outlook report; 
 Establish at network of data providers from different sectors that can provide information for 
model updates; and 
 Maintain the Advisory Committee Task Force. 
F. Vietnam
Sector Policy and Planning Process 
39. The Ministry of Industry and Trade (MOIT) is the government body for energy policy and 
planning. MOIT is responsible for overseeing all aspects of Vietnam's energy sector including 
electricity, new and renewable energy, coal, and the oil and gas industry. Specifically, MOIT is 
responsible for formulating and submitting to the Government draft laws, decrees and policies; 
preparing and submitting to the Government, or the Prime Minister for approval, overall development 
strategies and master plans; promulgating circulars, decisions, directives and other documents on 
state management and regulation for the listed sectors and fields. Under the current organisational 
structure, the MOIT’s functions of energy policy making and planning are effectively carried out by the 
General Directorate of Energy (GDE). 
40. GDE was established in September 2011 to carry out the function of advising and assisting the 
MOIT to execute the tasks of state management over the energy sector. GDE is responsible for 
drafting laws and degrees, preparing and evaluating development strategies and national master 
plans. In particular, GDE oversees the execution of approved electricity development master plans, 
and is heavily involved in negotiations with Build Operate Transfer (BOT), and IPP investors for 
approval of new power generation projects. GDE is responsible for national energy planning and 
energy policy, but they are not involved in the day-to-day management of Vietnam’s energy industry.
There have been discussions that a separate ministry for energy could be created from GDE in the 
coming years.
41. In relation to energy planning, GDE/MOIT prepares separate national development plans (also 
called master plans) for the power, coal and petroleum sectors. The current power master plan 
(number 7) was developed in 2011 for the period 2011–2020. The coal master plan was developed in 
early 2012 for same period, and the petroleum plan was approved in 2011 for a period until 2015. 
The plans are updated as required, for example, power master plan 7 was updated in 2013. 
42. Figure III-5 illustrates the governance structure of Vietnam’s electricity industry showing in 
particular the responsibilities between GDE, MOIT and the Prime Minister Office (PMO) in the 
planning process. The planning for coal and petroleum industries shall follow the same procedure, i.e. 
the plan being prepared by GDE and proposed by MOIT to PMO for approval. The Institute of Energy 
is a specialist group that supports the GDE, and in particular provides statistical and modelling 
services in support of developing Vietnam’s Power Master Plan (PMP). 742

43. The PMP is developed every 10 years for the following 10 year period with outlook to further 10 
subsequent years. The PMP is also subject to a midterm revision which occurs 5 years after the start 
of each PMP.
44. The PMP shall include the following main contents:
 Current status of the power sector and the implementation of the previous PMP; 
 National socio-economic background; 
 Electricity demand forecast; 
 Primary energy availability for power generation; 
 Renewable energy generation;
 Planned generation projects;

46. The Vietnam Institute of Energy is a dedicated entity (under MOIT) that has continually been 
involved in the preparation of Vietnam’s PMPs. They have established energy planning expertise, 
adequate planning tools and a network of updated industry data and information required for the PMP 
modelling. 
47. The current PMP (number 7) for the 2011-2020 period with the vision to 2030, which was 
approved on 21 July 2011, has strong emphasis on energy security, energy efficiency, renewable 
energy and power market development. It sets out six key directions and four specific targets for the 
Vietnam's power sector.
48. The six directions of the current PMP:-
A. Integrate the development of the power sector into socio-economic development and 
ensure sufficient supply of electricity for the national economic and social activities.
B. Supplement the efficient use of domestic energy resources with reasonable levels of
imported electricity and fuels, diversify the primary energy resources for power 
generation and promote fuel conservation to ensure energy security in the future.
C. Gradually improve the quality of electricity supply and electricity services, adjust the 
electricity tariffs in accordance with market-based mechanisms to encourage 
investment and the efficient use of electricity.
D. Develop the power sector in parallel with safeguards of natural resources, ecosystems 
and the environment.
E. Create a competitive power market by diversifying forms of electricity investment and 
trading. The State shall maintain monopoly only over the power transmission network
for the security of the national energy system.
F. Develop the power sector based on reasonable and efficient use of primary energy 
resources in each region and continue rural electrification to ensure sufficient supply of 
electricity to the entire country.
49. Specific targets of the current PMP:
A. Increase the aggregate electricity production (including import) from 200 billion kWh by 
2015 to 350 billion kWh by 2020 and 700 billion kWh by 2030.
B. Increase the proportion of renewable energy in the total electricity production from the 
present 3.5% to 4.5% in 2020 and 6% in 2030.
C. Reduce the average energy intensity elasticity (the ratio between the growth rate of 744
energy consumption and the growth rate of GDP in the same period) from the current 
2.0 to 1.5 in 2015 and 1.0 in 2020.
D. Promote rural electrification programs in remote areas and islands so that most of the 
rural households will have access to electricity by 2020.
Coal Sector Development Plan
50. The current Vietnam Coal Sector Development Plan was approved in January 2012 and is the 
first of its kind in the country. It contains development visions and objectives, and specific plans for the 
coal sector for a period until 2010 with outlook to 2030. 
51. The main content of the current coal development plan is:-
 Development visions for the sector; 
 Development objectives for exploration and production; 
 Coal demand forecast; 
 Total coal reserves and prioritising; 
 Exploration plan; 
 Production and processing plan; 
 Coal transportation plan; 
 Coal export and import plan; 
 Facility planning for coal export and import; 
 Financial requirements; 
 Policy recommendations; and 
 Implementation plan. 
52. The Coal Sector Development Plan provides a development vision as follows:-
A. Develop the sector with rational production and use of coal, and with the priority to 
meet the domestic demand and contribute to supporting national energy security. 
Gradually reduce coal export and limit it only to the types of coal that are not used by 
local consumers.
B. Promote exploration and assessing activities to ensure there are reliable and adequate 
coal resources for the sector sustainable, long-term growth and for meeting the future 
demands. 
C. Diversify the financing sources with the state-owned enterprises retaining dominating 
roles, and implement market-based mechanisms for coal trading.
D. Develop the coal sector in parallel with safeguards of natural resources, ecosystems 
and the environment.
53. It also sets out the following targets for the sector:-
A. Specific exploration timelines for each coal basin; and 
B. Production targets set at 58 million tons by 2015, 65 million tons by 2020, 70 million 
tons by 2025 and 75 million tons by 2030. 745
Petroleum Sector Development Plan 
54. The current Vietnam Petroleum Sector Development Plan was approved in March 2011 and is 
the first of its kind in the country. It contains development visions, objectives and directions for the 
petroleum sector for a period until 2015 with outlook to 2025. 
55. The main contents of the current petroleum development plan include:-
 Development visions for the sector; 
 Development objectives for exploration and production; 
 Development directions for exploration and production; 
 Development directions for the gas pipe network; 
 Development directions for LPG terminals; 
 Trading and pricing mechanisms; 
 Financial requirements; 
 Policy recommendations; and 
 Implementation plan. 
56. The development vision arising from the Petroleum Sector Development Plan is:-
A. The state maintains the leading role in investing into the petroleum sector 
infrastructure;
B. Develop the sector with rational exploitation and use of natural resources, increasing 
import to ensure sustainable energy supply in future;
C. Promote investments into natural gas processing and refining activities, reduce LPG 
share in the total petroleum import; 
D. Effectively utilise the existing infrastructure such as pipelines, terminals and 
processing facilities;
E. Develop the gas consumption market with state regulation; gradually integrate into 
regional and international markets.
57. Development objectives:
A. Natural gas production to achieve 14 billion cubic meters in 2015 and 19 billion cubic 
meters in 2015; and 
B. LPG production to achieve 2 million tons in 2015 and 4 million tons in 2015.
Integrated Energy Planning 
58. The development strategy for the energy sector to the year 2020 with a vision to 2050 was 
approved by the Prime Minister in 2007. The strategy outlined broad development objectives of the 
energy subsectors including electricity, coal and petroleum. It also set out the MOIT responsibility for 
preparing the energy sector development plan and development plans for the individual subsectors. 
59. Nevertheless, in Vietnam, developing a single IEP process has not been done. Coordination 
between plans is largely achieved by simply setting a broad set of development objectives for each 
subsector. For the electricity, coal and petroleum sectors, these objectives largely shape the formal 
planning that is carried out. 746
G. Australia 
Energy Sector Management 
60. The energy sector in Australia is under the management of the Australian Federal Government 
and the state governments. The federal government is responsible for making national policies and 
regulations while the jurisdictions manage their state-bound energy resources and infrastructure.
61. The federal overseeing body for energy is the Department of Industry (formerly, the 
Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism). Another essential agency is the Standing Council on 
Energy and Resources (SCER) which is attached to the Council of Australian Governments (COAG). 
SCER coordinates the national energy policy among the states and is responsible for pursuing priority 
issues of national significance in the energy and resources sectors and progressing the key reform 
elements. SCER specific duties include:
 Progress consistent upstream petroleum administration and regulation standards; 
 Address issues affecting investment in resources exploration and development; 
 Develop a nationally consistent approach to clean energy technology; 
 Promote efficiency and investment in generation and networks; 
 Build on Australia's resilience to energy supply shocks. 
Energy Sector Planning Overview
62. Since Australia has liberalised its energy markets, the planning practice was made to a 
minimum. There is no such a centralised planning process for development of energy industries as 
could have been witnessed in other developing countries. Instead, most investment decisions have 
been taken by businesses purely based on market circumstances. Nevertheless, the government 
does carry out the overall Australia's Energy Resource Assessment and National Energy Security 
Assessment, as well as different initiatives and plans for targeted areas such as National Strategy on 
Energy Efficiency, Energy Savings Initiative (ESI) and Renewable Energy Target (RET).
63. Recent developments may suggest there is a trend back to a more consolidated and 
centralised approach of managing the energy policy and planning issues. In particular, since 2013 the 
National Transmission Network Development Plan has been commenced for the electricity market. A 
mandatory petroleum data reporting regime is now being drafted for the petroleum sector, and the 
government is also in the process of preparing the first Energy White Paper dubbed as an integrated 
approach to Australia's energy policy. 
Australia's Energy Resource Assessment
64. On 1 March 2010, the former Minister for Resources and Energy released the first edition of the 
Australian Energy Resource Assessment. The assessment, undertaken by Geoscience Australia (GA) 
and the Australian Bureau for Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE) provides a national 
prospectus of Australia's energy resources. For the first time it brings together a comprehensive 
understanding of the country rich energy resource endowment, integrating geoscience and long term 
economic energy outlooks with common terms and definitions.
65. The assessment examines identified and potential capacities from both non-renewable (coal, 
uranium and increasingly gas) and renewable energy resources (wind, geothermal, solar and 747
bioenergy). It also considers the factors likely to influence Australia's energy future in a low-carbon 
economy to 2030. The next edition of the assessment is expected to be released soon. 
National Energy Security Assessment
66. In 2011 the former department of Resources, Energy and Tourism released the National 
Energy Security Assessment (NESA) which considers the key influences on the supply of energy in 
Australia in the short, medium and long terms covering the period 2011–2035. The NESA identifies 
key strategic energy security issues in the liquid fuels, natural gas and electricity sectors currently, and 
those likely to impact the level of energy security. The assessment collates and analyses available 
information and provides an assessment of energy security. The assessment considers how the 
identified strategic issues could affect adequacy, reliability and affordability in each of the energy 
sectors.
67. In 2012, the department commissioned two additional reports to further examine issues 
identified in the 2011 NESA.
National Strategy on Energy Efficiency
68. In July 2009, the COAG approved the comprehensive, 10-year National Strategy on Energy 
Efficiency (NSEE), to accelerate energy efficiency improvements and deliver cost-effective energy 
efficiency gains across all sectors of the Australian economy. The NSEE aims to streamline roles and 
responsibilities across government by providing a nationally consistent and coordinated approach to 
energy efficiency.
69. The NSEE was updated in July 2010.
Energy Savings Initiative
70. The Energy Savings Initiative Working Group released their information paper in July 2013. 
The Australian Government committed to do further work to investigate the merits of a national ESI.
ESI is a market-based approach for driving economy-wide improvements in energy efficiency. It would 
place a requirement on obligated parties (typically energy retailers) to find and implement energy 
savings in households and businesses. An ESI would help energy consumers to save money by 
encouraging the identification and take-up of energy efficient technologies.
Renewable Energy Target
71. The Renewable Energy Target (RET) scheme is designed to ensure that 20 per cent of 
Australia’s electricity comes from renewable sources by 2020. The RET scheme is helping to 
transform our electricity generation mix to cleaner and more diverse sources and supporting growth 
and employment in the renewable energy sector.
72. Since January 2011 the RET scheme has operated in two parts: the Small-scale Renewable 
Energy Scheme (SRES) and the Large-scale Renewable Energy Target (LRET).
73. Large-scale Renewable Energy Target: 
 The LRET creates a financial incentive for the establishment or expansion of renewable 
energy power stations, such as wind and solar farms or hydro-electric power stations. It 
does this by legislating demand for Large-scale Generation Certificates (LGCs). One LGC 748
can be created for each megawatt-hour of eligible renewable electricity produced by an 
accredited renewable power station. LGCs can be sold to entities (mainly electricity 
retailers) who surrender them annually to the Clean Energy Regulator to demonstrate their 
compliance with the RET scheme’s annual targets. The revenue earned by the power 
station for the sale of LGCs is additional to that received for the sale of the electricity 
generated. 
 The LRET includes legislated annual targets which will require significant investment in 
new renewable energy generation capacity in coming years. The large-scale targets ramp 
up until 2020 when the target will be 41,000 GWh of renewable electricity generation. 
74. Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme:
 The SRES creates a financial incentive for households, small businesses and community 
groups to install eligible small-scale renewable energy systems such as solar water 
heaters, heat pumps, solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, small-scale wind systems, or 
small-scale hydro systems. It does this by legislating demand for Small-scale Technology 
Certificates (STCs). STCs are created for these systems at the time of installation, 
according to the amount of electricity they are expected to produce or displace in the future. 
For example, the SRES allows eligible solar PV systems to create, at the time of 
installation, STCs equivalent to 15 years of expected system output. 
 The RET scheme is currently under the review as to whether the objective to deliver 41,000 
GWhand small solar generation by 2020 is still appropriate. 
National Transmission Network Development Plan
75. The purpose of the National Transmission Network Development Plan (NTNDP) is to facilitate 
the development of an efficient national electricity network that considers potential transmission and 
generation investments. The NTNDP provides an independent, strategic view of the efficient 
development of the National Electricity Market (NEM) transmission network over a 25-year planning 
horizon. It is focused on large-scale electricity generation and the main transmission networks that 
connect this generation to population and industrial centres.
76. The first NTNDP was prepared by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) using 
information available at 1 November 2013; however the impact of changes after this date has been 
assessed where practical. The plan contains a consolidated list of projects for the Transmission 
Network Service Providers (TNSP) in Australia.
Mandatory petroleum data reporting regime
77. On 25 January 2013, the then Minister for Resources and Energy announced the Australian 
Government's decision to develop and implement a mandatory petroleum data reporting regime. 
Mandatory reporting will improve the quality and coverage of data on the production, sale, stock 
holding and trade of petroleum across the Australian supply chain.
78. On 20 May 2013, a discussion paper was released to facilitate the first stage of consultation 
with stakeholders on the design and implementation of the regime. The main objectives of the 
discussion paper are to:
 identify the data and data reporters required to develop a precise and comprehensive 
petroleum dataset for Australia; 749
 determine whether existing regulatory activities and/or the business data systems 
developed for them could separately or collectively be used as part of the mandatory 
petroleum data reporting regime; and 
 facilitate future government data requirements in a manner which minimises the regulatory 
burden on reporting entities. 
79. Further stakeholder consultation is being undertaken to facilitate the development of the 
mandatory petroleum data reporting regime. 
Australia’s Energy White Paper 
80. Referred to as an integrated approach to energy policy, the Australia’s Energy White Paper will 
set out a coherent and integrated approach to energy policy to reduce cost pressure on households 
and businesses, improve Australia’s international competitiveness and grow the export base and 
economic prosperity. It will consider Australia’s supply and use of energy resources, including how 
increases in new energy sources can meet demand. The Energy White Paper will also look at 
regulatory reform to put downward pressure on prices and improve energy efficiency.
81. The Department of Industry is leading the development of the Energy White Paper with advice 
from an Expert Reference Panel. There are three stages in the development of the White Paper:
 The Issues Paper, which provides an overview of the identified issues of interest to the 
Government. 
 The Green Paper, which will draw on submissions to the Issues Paper and assess the 
issues and policy approaches. 
 The White Paper, which will draw on submissions to the Green Paper and present the 
Government’s strategic direction and policy commitments. 
82. The first Australia’s Energy White Paper is expected to be released in December 2014.
H. Lessons from Review of International Practices for Myanmar IEP 
83. It is important to have a streamlined set-up of the governmental authorities/agencies who are 
involved in policy making and planning for the energy sector. The planning functions of each authority 
should be clearly spelt to avoid being overlapped, and it is desirable that there is a single minister with 
sufficient mandate and resources to oversee the entire planning matter. Such an arrangement is 
helpful for achieving better coordination of efforts and more efficient management and utilisation of 
energy data. 
84. Key to successful planning is to set out detailed procedure, timing, scope and contents of the 
planning activities. It will reduce the time spent and help to coherently address the planning 
objectives. While energy planning horizons are normally medium to long terms, there should be a 
timeframe for updates and revisions to accommodate changes in the underlining circumstances 
during the planned term.
85. It is beneficial to have a dedicated institution for energy plan preparation. Energy planning 
requires specific, multidiscipline expertise and a continuously updated bank of data about the industry 
and the wider economy. A specialised energy planner would be the best venue to consolidate needed 
expertise and manage an updated planning database. The examples of dedicated energy planners 
are the Institute of Energy for preparing PMPs in Vietnam and an recommended Planning Unit for 
implementing IEM in Pakistan. 750
86. More integrated approaches have been used, whether this is for planning an individual sector 
or the entire energy industry. The power sector development plans, for example, have become more 
comprehensive in countries by incorporating considerations of renewable and alternative energy 
sources, accounting for primary energy sectors such as oil, gas and coal, and considering linkages 
with other parts including land use and water supply.
87. Having a holistic development plan for the entire energy industry is on agenda for all countries 
under the above review. Although there have been different levels of planning details and actual 
realisation, the countries will likely look at implementing full integrated energy sector planning in 
future. The advantage of producing one energy plan in a single is to achieve more efficient allocation 
of natural resources, avoid counterproductive nexus effects and make the industry growth more 
sustainable and resilient with better environmental considerations.
88. It is noted that in cases with developed energy markets, with Australia being an example, 
despite many investment decisions in the industry being shifted from a planning-driven process to a 
market-driven approach, centralised planning processes are still maintained for strategic and/or 
regulated areas such as the power transmission networks and “backbone” infrastructure. The 
Government also periodically conducts assessments of national energy resources and the 
implications for energy security. In addition, the introduction of the Energy White Paper in Australia 
suggests a recent trend towards having a higher level of consolidation of energy planning activities.
Thus, market liberalisation, as has occurred in the energy space does not necessarily mean the role 
of coordinated energy planning becomes diminished; in fact, this remains a key tool for coordination of 
planning both regulated or government elements of the energy industry with those areas that are 
driven more by market-based investment decisions. This is critical for assessing and providing some 
assurance for national energy security.751
IV. CURRENT ENERGY PLANNING ARRANGMENETS IN MYANMAR 
I. Energy Sector Governance in Myanmar: Current Situation 
89. Regarded as an enabler for economic activity in the country, Myanmar’s energy sector has 
received significant attention in recent years. In January 2013, the government established NEMC 
with a view of being a multi-ministerial coordinating body to comprehensively address all energy 
demand and supply related issues.
90. NEMC has its Patron being the Vice President of Myanmar and its Chairman being the Union 
Minister for Energy. NEMC primary function is to provide administrative functions for all energy policy 
and planning matters. In addition, the government also constituted Energy Development Committee 
(EDC) to support the activities of NEMC.
The present governance structure of Myanmar’s energy sector is set out in 
91. Figure IV-1. This illustrates the relationship between NEMC, EDC and other entities that 
influence Myanmar’s energy industry. 
92. The following are the entities referenced in the diagram:
 NEMC National Energy Management Committee; 
 EDC Energy Development Committee; 
 MOI Ministry of Industry – energy efficiency and conservation (EE&C), 
 nuclear power, renewable energy (RE); 
 MOM Ministry of Mines – coal; 
 MOEP Ministry of Electric Power – electricity sector and geothermal sector ; 
 MOA Ministry of Agriculture – mini-hydro; 
 MOE Ministry of Energy – oil and gas, petroleum industry, and geothermal; 
 MOECAF Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Forestry – fuel wood and 
 biomass; 
 MOLFRD: Ministry of Livestock, Fisheries and Rural Development; 
 MOST: Ministry of Science and Technology – nuclear, renewable energy, 
 nuclear power, biomass, wind and solar; 
 MES: Myanmar Engineering Society – renewable energy; 
 REAM: Renewable Energy Association Myanmar – renewable energy; and 
 MGS: Myanmar Geoscience Society – renewable energy, geothermal and 
 coal. 
93. Other critical entities in Myanmar’s energy sector, not illustrated in the diagram include: 
 MOGE: Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise, who is concerned with the 
 commercial management of Myanmar’s oil and gas resources; 752
 MPPE: Myanmar Petroleum Products Enterprise, concerned with the 
 commercial management of Myanmar’s petroleum sector; and 
 MPE: Myanmar Petrochemical Enterprise, who is concerned with the 
 commercial management of Myanmar’s petrochemical industry.

ii. Engage with members of the President Office, Natural Resources and 
Environmental Conservation Committee and the Mineral and Natural Resources 
Affairs Committee.
K. Comments on the present state 
95. The duties and functions NEMC as formally defined can be placed within the context of an IEP 
process. The present governance structure and supporting National Energy Policy provides a 
foundation for an EMP process, however a number of enhancements are required in order for it to 
become a well-functioning process. 
96. However, the roles and responsibilities at the working level need to be strengthened in order to 
enable NEMC to achieve its overarching objectives. NEMC could be considered to be analogous to 
a planning commission, while the NEMC working level staff could be responsible for essentially 
undertaking energy planning. 
97. As illustrated in Figure IV-1 responsibilities are spread over many different ministries for 
different components of Myanmar’s energy sector. This is a considerable impediment to developing a 
holistic and coherent IEP / EMP process as to information transfers and synchronisation of the 
inputs/outputs between the EMP and many other ministerial planning works. 
98. A number of other planning processes have been established in Myanmar by the different 
ministries for particular subsectors of the energy industry. Among others, there is a Power Master 
Plan (PMP), a Forestry Master Plan (FMP), a Transport Plan, and short and long term plans for the oil 
and gas sector. Thus the relationship between an IEP process and these other plans needs to be 
carefully developed and considered as part of enhancing Myanmar’s institutional arrangements for an 
IEP process.755
V. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS TO SUPPORT IEP IN MYANMAR 
99. The previous sections have set out the issues that an IEP process needs to address, reviewed 
the arrangements in several comparator countries, and reviewed and critiqued the arrangements 
presently in place in Myanmar. We can leverage these insights to make some recommendations to 
enhance Myanmar’s current arrangements to better support an IEP / EMP process.
100. In particular, we have organised a number of options and recommendations in the following 
way: 
A. Organisational structure and allocation of responsibilities. 
B. Definition of IEP / EMP process and how it is managed within the organisational 
structure that we recommend. 
C. Human capacity requirements.
D. Software tools and training considerations.
L. Organisational Structure 
101. Figure IV-1 combined with the roles and duties of NEMC defined in the National Energy Policy 
provide a reasonable foundation for a coordinated approach to energy planning. However, the 
following are the two key enhancements to the existing structure that we recommended:
A. Establish a permanent and specialist IEP team within the existing governance 
structure at NEMC. 
B. Allocate the roles and duties of the concerned IEP team, the Ministries and NEMC in a 
way that can support the IEP process. 
Concept of IEP Team and Allocation of Duties for the Purpose of IEP 
102. NEMC itself could be thought of as more of a Planning Commission and the NEMC working 
level staff as an Energy Planning team, for example, an “Energy Wing” of the Planning Commission. 
This is a common structure implemented in other countries. The concept is illustrated in Figure V-1, 
where we have introduced the IEP Team to the current structure in Myanmar. 756
Figure V-1: IEP Team 
Source: Consultant
103. Shown in the diagram is the concept of the ministry specialist advisors, who feed into the IEP 
Team critical information relevant to the ministries that each represents. In essence the Ministry 
specialists would be responsible for the following duties: 
A. Provide macroeconomic policy options;
B. Provide strategic development plans for economic sectors;
C. Provide primary resource assessments; 
D. Develop roadmaps (pipelines, storage depots, roads, railway lines, power plant sites); 
E. Evaluate energy supply technologies; and 
F. Report on energy statistics for consolidation to the IEP Team. 
104. The IEP Team would be responsible for the key activities associated with the IEP process: 
A. Definition of policy and socio-economic issues;
B. Definition of regulations;
C. Compilation of Energy Statistics;
D. Definition of planning criteria and targets;

105. And finally, NEMC taking the form of a Planning Commission, would be responsible for: 
A. Ratification of projections of estimated future energy needs in support of 
macroeconomic and socio-economic requirements; 
B. Recommend preferred energy supply options in light of:-
i. High-impact national policy imperatives 
ii. Various technology assumptions 
C. Recommend energy policy to support the preferred path.

IEP Team Structure 
107. The IEP Team itself can be structured as a specialised energy planning entity, with a structure 
such as that illustrated in Figure V-3. 
108. The roles within the IEP Team would be: 
A. Director General. The Director General would be responsible for delivering the 
Integrated Energy Plan to the NEMC. The Director would identify policy issues and 
make recommendations on policy options for NEMC’s consideration. These could 
form the basis of policy-based expansion scenarios in accordance with national 
economic growth aspirations, international obligations and other criteria. The 
expansion scenarios could be modelled by energy planners and subsequently 
assessed for its suitability. It would then ultimately lead to a final recommendation to 
be made to NEMC. 
B. Ministry Specialist Advisors. The ministry specialist advisors are needed to 
contribute as advisors to the IEP in respect of (1) primary resource development, 
specifically to advise the projected economic value of local fuels, (2) consumption 
patterns, (3) supply technology selection based on field experience and capability, and 
(4) provision of energy statistics to the energy statistics team. Development partners 
could play the role of specialist advisors to assist the Director General in relation to 
energy planning and energy policy. 
C. Energy Policy Division. Develop high-level scenarios in accordance with national 
development plan and strategic policy etc. Develop policy implications of the IEP. 
Conduct energy demand forecast through modelling specialists. 
D. Energy Statistics Division. The energy statistics team is responsible for 
maintaining an energy statistics digest on an annual basis, by sector (for example, 
solid fuel, petroleum, gas, renewables, electricity etc.) The team would also be 
responsible for developing demand and supply statistics to the demand and supply 
modelling specialists within the energy modelling team. 
E. Energy Planning Division. The energy planning team could be structured so that it 
comprises: (1) a demand modelling specialist capability, to consolidate energy demand 
forecasts by Primary, Secondary and Tertiary sectors, (2) a supply modelling specialist 
capability to develop policy-based expansion plans, and (3) an economist / financial 
capability to cost supply expansion plans and to undertake tariff analysis. Another 
role of the energy planning team would be to monitor the progress of previously 
developed plans, and identify and improve the IEP process over time, so that over time 
it can become more aligned with outcomes to date as well as reflective of emerging 
issues. Note that some functions of the energy planning team described here could 
be outsourced to specialist institutions.
F. Outsourcing of specialist activities. It may make sense for certain functions to be 
outsourced to specialist entities, such as institutions or universities. For example, 
other entities could perform energy consumption surveys, they could perform analysis 
and diagnosis of pilot projects to enhance energy efficiency or renewable energy, or 
they could take a larger role, such as performing least cost energy planning, which 
would mean that the energy planning division would take on more of a role of 
oversighting the modelling and planning rather than being directly responsible for it. 759

M. IEP Process 
109. The EMP is typically repeated on a cycle of 5 years. 
110. The main aspects of any IEP implementation includes the following:-
A. Data collection. A strategy needs to be put into place to support the routine collection 
and reporting of. While data uncertainty can never be completely eliminated, the need 
for verification and validation is important as it ultimately informs the IEP process of 
trends in energy supply and energy demand. Furthermore, a process to recognise and 
set in motion a process for obtaining any missing data is required – for example, 
designing targeted surveys or legislating mandatory declarations of stocks and 
inventory for commercial enterprise. Tools such as spreadsheets and databases are 
required to support this.
B. Compilation, analysis and statistical reporting on data. Data will necessarily be 
fragmented across different agencies who are concerned with different subsets of the 
energy conversion chain (gas, oil, electricity, commerce, industry, etc.). The data 
needs to be transformed to develop a holistic picture of the energy situation. This 
may require analytics and/or reconciliation processes to eliminate gaps. Analysis of 
this kind enables one to identify any emerging trends in energy supply and demand, 
which in turn is necessary for use in the development or calibration of forecasting 
models. 
C. Energy demand forecasting. The IEP requires as a key input projections of energy 
demand for all key sectors: industry, commerce, residential, agriculture, transport and 
others. These need to be consistent with an underlying set of economic scenarios. The 
IEP may involve developing a set of independent forecasts or leveraging externally 
developed forecasts3
. Other dimensions to this include the issue of energy efficiency

Advisors
Some specialist activities 
could be outsourced to a 
specialist entity, e.g. 
university and/or research 
institutes760
and energy access. Models to support the development of energy demand forecasts 
are essential.
D. Energy supply forecasting. Issues to be addressed include estimates of primary 
energy resources, existing and planned infrastructure, options for development, cost of 
developing primary energy resources, fuel costs, operational expenditure, capital 
costs, assessments of conventional and emerging technologies, and costs of 
developing them etc. Again, a database and basic supply option cost models support 
this process.
E. Developing an overall strategy. A process to translate the projections and modelling 
results into a meaningful set of recommendations. The demand and supply analysis 
will require consideration of a range of scenarios that need to eventually be used to 
guide key decisions on policy and a concrete set of implementation plans or roadmaps
for each of the main subsectors. 
F. Monitoring and evaluation. Finally, the progress, and effectiveness of any IEP needs to 
be checked. This process is one of comparing actual outcomes to those that had been 
planned, identifying areas of discrepancy and making refinements to the IEP process 
to better address these issues on a go-forward basis. 
111. It may be possible to streamline some aspects of the preparation of the EMP so that some 
aspects are updated more frequently than others. 
N. Relationship between EMP and Other Planning Processes 
112. Figure V-4 conceptually illustrates the linkage between the EMP and other planning or policy 
processes in Myanmar4
. This highlights the need for coordination between the different planning 
processes and also the potential for there to be interface issues; the boundaries between the EMP 
and other planning processes must be carefully defined and managed. 
113. A number of the ministries already have in place their own forward-looking process, in 
particular:
 MOEP – 20-year Power Master Plan; 
 MOGE – 30-year plan that is updated as required, and a 20-year oil and gas plan; 
 MOECAF – Forestry Master Plan; and 
 Most of the other ministries also have in place planning processes. 
114. The IEP process is intended to provide an integrated implementation of the individual 
subsectors. A key issue is the relationship between EMP and other ministry-level plans. Ideally the 
top-down and bottom-up assessments will be consistent, although this can’t always be guaranteed. In 
this context, the EMP is defining the broad parameters or a broad space that then needs to be filled in 
with the details by the concerned ministry. 
115. For instance, for the power sector, the EMP provides the broad direction, but it does not 
provide a detailed consideration of transmission and distribution investments, this is an issue for 
MOEP to address. For other sectors, the situation is similar. 
 
they could be independently developed as part of a centrally coordinated EMP framework. 
4
In fact, it could be any country.761

O. Human Capacity 
116. The previous sections set out an organisational structure and procedure for successfully 
implementing the IEP. As discussed, functionality falls into four (4) main categories that can be either 
common across all the Phases or embedded within one Phase. These categories are:
 Co-ordination & program management; 
 Demand side assessment; 
 Supply side assessment; and
 Statistics. 
117. The skill sets required to undertake these critical functions are discussed in the subsections 
that follow. We have detailed the total skill sets required to complete the tasks that fall within the 
categories outlined. It is envisaged that these skill sets would reside within multiple individuals who 
are in the IEP Team structure that was set out earlier. It is unlikely that one individual could either (a) 
undertake the work required within the timeframe provided, or (b) have sufficient diversity in expertise 
across all areas to undertake the work to a sufficiently high standard.
118. All the members of this team must have good communication skills particularly with regards to 
coordination with ministries, and the production of documents for circulation amongst ministries. The 
ability to engage and collaborate with stakeholders at all levels of this team is very important.
Energy statistics 
119. Energy statistics involves initial data gathering as well as the measurement and monitoring of 
the success of the prior period EMP. This area requires people qualified in mathematics, statistics 
and/or econometrics. 
120. Energy statisticians specialise in the compilation verification and dissemination of information 
on all aspects of energy including its production transformation and consumption of all fuels 
renewables emergency reporting system energy efficiency indicators CO2 emissions and energy 
prices and taxes done managers are responsible for receiving reviewing and importing data 
submissions from ministries and other sources into last computerised databases.

121. The statisticians check for completeness correct calculations internal consistence consistency 
accuracy and consistency with definitions. Often this will entail proactively investigating and helping to 
resolve anomalies in collaboration with ministries.
122. Data managers and statisticians also play a key role in helping design and implement computer 
macros used in the preparation of the EMP. 
123. These team members should have a university degree in a topic relevant to either energy, 
computer programming or statistics. They should have experience in the basic use databases and 
computer software.
124. Members of the statistics team must have the ability to work accurately, to pay attention to 
detail, and work to deadlines. They also must have the ability to deal simultaneously with a wide 
variety of tasks and to organise the work efficiently.
125. At least one or two of the members of this team must have good communication skills 
particularly with regards to coordination with ministries, and the production of documents for 
circulation amongst ministries.
126. Subsets of the skills required to undertake this function would include data collection and 
analysis, the ability to perform an energy balance and experience in conducting surveys on energy 
use and consumption.
Energy demand forecasting 
127. Energy demand forecasting is a specialised skill area. 
128. The senior in charge of the energy forecasting group should be responsible for the delivery of 
all energy forecast across various energy sources. These sources include coal, electricity, gas, 
petroleum and biomass.
129. The senior requires a team that is capable of undertaking statistical and mathematical 
modelling to develop both short and long-term energy forecasts. The team are also required to 
develop technical solutions to problems that impact energy demand.
130. Relevant tertiary qualifications in statistics, mathematics, econometrics, science, engineering 
or economics will be useful in this role. At least one or two members must have an understanding of 
the workings and impacts (on demand forecasts) of demand management and energy efficiency.
131. In addition, strong programming and data management skills as well as experience in statistical 
or mathematical modelling and database development are important.
132. Due to the scope and importance of the function of this team, members must have the ability to 
take ownership of pieces of analytical work.
133. The team members should have an interest in macroeconomic modelling and forecasting and a 
keen interest in real world economic issues and policy developments.
134. At least one or two of the members of this team must have good communication skills 
particularly with regards to coordination with ministries, and the production of documents for 
circulation amongst ministries. The ability to engage and collaborate with stakeholders at all levels of 
this team is important. 763
Energy supply modelling 
135. A large proportion of the functionality that is required of this team lies in their ability to 
undertake research. Research into processes and trends that are emerging in the technology or 
conversion market that is being assessed, as well as the external environment that may affect all the 
future supply options.
136. The team as a whole must have the capacity to develop solutions and organise a complex 
workflow. 
137. At least one or two of the members of this team must have good communication skills 
particularly with regards to coordination with ministries, and the production of documents for 
circulation amongst ministries. The ability to engage and collaborate with stakeholders at all levels of 
this team are important
138. This team could be divided into two types of groups: (a) engineering group, and (b) financial 
group. 
Energy supply modelling: engineering group 
139. The engineering group would be concerned more with technology assessments and supply 
options for its applicability in energy extraction or conversion within an energy system. Across multiple 
streams there need to be specialists with backgrounds in engineering for coal, gas, electricity, 
renewables, petroleum, demand management & energy efficiency. Within these categories an 
understanding of the following is required:
 Technology assessments; 
 Renewable energy / non-conventional technologies; and 
 Primary energy resource assessments. 
140. The members within the engineering group should have experience in some (or all) of those 
areas combined with strong communication skills, and the ability to research. As a whole, the team 
must have the ability to undertake analytical thinking and to take a logical, defensible approach to 
resolution of problems.
Energy supply modelling: economics and financial group 
141. The economics group would need to be responsible for costing models for the supply chain, 
assessing value of expansion options, fuel sources, capital costs and so on. The team would need to 
be able to understand and develop: 
 costing models; 
 expansion models; 
 macro-economic outlooks; 
 cost-benefit analysis; and 
 tariffs / pricing analysis. 
142. Therefore there is a requirement for a group within the supply modelling team that understand 
the costing of different types of technology, and the capacity to forecast changes in technology costs 
over time (technology curve).764
143. Ideally the staff engaged in this area would have some level of exposure to energy specific 
analysis, costing structures, and event forecasts. Team members should have considerable 
experience in working with and developing applied macroeconomic models, combined with excellent 
macro-modelling and macro-econometric skills. 
Comments on Training Areas 
144. Figure V-5 sets out possible areas of training and capacity building which provides coverage of 
all key areas and topics that the energy planning team requires.

I. INTRODUCTION 
1. Intelligent Energy Systems Pty Ltd (IES) in association with Myanmar International Consultants 
Co. Ltd. (MMIC) were contracted by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to undertake the following 
Technical Assistance (TA) project: “TA-8356 MYA: Institutional Strengthening of National Energy 
Committee in Energy Policy and Planning – 1 Energy Master Plan Consultant (46389-001)”. The 
project objectives are to: (1) provide technical assistance and institutional strengthening to the 
National Energy Management Committee (NEMC) in Energy Policy and Planning, and (2) to prepare 
a 20-year Myanmar Long-Term Energy Master Plan for the energy sector of Myanmar.
2. The detailed terms of reference (TOR) for the project as specified by ADB is reproduced in 
Section II. 
II. PROJECT TERMS OF REFERENCE 
A. Scope of Work
3. Under the technical assistance for Institutional Strengthening of NEMC in Energy Policy and 
Planning, a team of consultants will be engaged to prepare a 20-year energy master plan for 
Myanmar, including an energy demand forecast, supply options, investment requirements, and legal 
and institutional arrangements. To strengthen the abilities of NEMC and the EDC to prepare an energy 
policy, a renewable energy development strategy, and an energy efficiency policy in coordination with 
seven concerned ministries, three (3) international and four (4) national experts were engaged. The 
project team will be required to prepare several reports, set up systems and procedures, implement a 
variety of capacity development activities, and monitor project implementation.
B. Long-Term Energy Master Plan
4. A team of international and national consultants from a consulting firm will be engaged to 
prepare the 20-year energy master plan. This will be done in accordance with the Asian Development 
Bank (ADB) Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The work 
will require about 18 person-months of international consulting services and 20 person-months of 
national consulting services. A team of experts comprising an energy statistician, an energy planner, 
and an energy economist will be engaged from a consulting firm that has expertise in energy demand 
and market analysis, demand projections, assessing supply options to meet energy demand, 
investment requirements, and legal and institutional arrangements. 
5. The energy statisticians (international, 6 person-months; national, 12 person months) will 
undertake the following activities:
(i) Consolidate the existing fragmented energy statistics and planning studies and reports for 
the energy sector from the seven concerned ministries, including the Ministry of Energy 
(oil and gas sectors); the Ministry of Electric Power (power sector); the Ministry of Mines 
(coal development); the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (biofuels, and micro-hydro 
for irrigation purposes); the Ministry of Science and Technology (renewable energy); the 
Ministry of Environmental Conservation and Forestry (fuelwood, climate change, and 
environmental safeguards requirements); and the Ministry of Industry (energy efficiency).
(ii) Collect and compile energy statistics and energy outlooks prepared by the International 
Energy Agency, ADB, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and other development A4 
partners.
(iii) Conduct the surveys on the use of energy in various sectors.
(iv) Review existing energy data and develop an energy balance for 2000–2012 for
Myanmar, adapting the methodology used by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
forum in its Energy Demand and Supply Outlook, including overall energy balances, as 
an input to energy projection.
(v) Develop the manual or tool kit for preparing a primary energy consumption and energy 
balance table.
(vi) Train staff from concerned ministries on the developed manual or tool kit and will develop 
a capacity development plan.
6. The energy planners (international, 5 person-months; national, 4 person-months) will 
undertake the following activities:
(i) Develop a common methodology for energy demand and supply analysis and make 
demand projections for each primary energy and each sector based on the developed 
energy balance for the next 20 years. These projections will take into account projections 
for gross domestic product, population and other economic indicators in close 
consultation with the Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development and 
research institutions.
(ii) Assess the supply potential of primary energy sources in Myanmar such as biomass, 
coal, oil, gas, hydro, and renewable energy.
(iii) Assess the technical feasibility of primary energy supply options in close consultations 
with the energy economist.
(iv) Recommend least-cost options for delivering the energy supply required to meet the 
energy demand, in close consultation with the energy economist.
(v) Train staff from the concerned ministries on the developing common methodology and 
develop the capacity development plan.
(vi) Design, organize, facilitate, and document public discussions with a range of 
stakeholders, including civil society, and ensure that these discussions follow ADB 
models of good practice for consultation.
7. The Energy Economists (international, 7 person-months; national, 4 person-months will 
undertake the following activities:
(i) Assess the economic feasibility of primary energy supply options in close consultations 
with the energy planner.
(ii) Recommend least-cost options for delivering the energy supply required to meet energy 
demand, also in close consultation with the energy planner.
(iii) Assess the availability of financial resources from domestic and international bilateral, 
multilateral, and private sector sources to meet investment needs, and develop a 
financing plan to implement the long-term planning.
(iv) Suggest the financing modality, including public–private partnerships.A5 
(v) Identify the institutional and regulatory impediments to collecting energy information and 
preparing the long-term outlook.
(vi) Determine the improvements necessary in the institutional and regulatory framework to 
support the function of energy planning in the Ministry of Energy (MOE).
(vii) Supervise and organize the necessary workshops and seminars and conduct the
necessary training and capacity building on energy balance and planning, including a 
capacity development implementation program.
8. The consultants will prepare an inception report within 1 month, an interim report within 6 
months, and a draft final report within 11 months from the commencement of consulting services. For 
each report, the consultants will organize a workshop to enhance staff skills in energy planning from 
the concerned ministries.
C. Variations to Scope of Work 
The following variations to the scope of work were initiated by ADB: 
9. ADB separately engaged a Consultant to undertake a power expansion plan. IES was 
instructed to follow this expansion plan as the electricity sector strategy for Myanmar and to not 
consider independently developed views or cost estimates for the electricity sector. 
10. The ADB expansion plan is to be included as an appendix to the Energy Master Plan (EMP) 
final report.
11. The long-term energy plan was to be determined to 2030 in order to facilitate comparison to 
other studies and work. In the report it is only necessary to provide projections on outcomes for a 
15-year period from 2015 to 2030.
12. Only a single medium-case energy supply outlook is to be developed.Project Number: TA No. 8356-MYA

NOTES ON ENERGY PLANNING 
A. Introduction
1. Strategic energy sector planning requires the use of formal methods that ensure 
transparency, comprehensiveness, consistency between subsectors and reproducibility. As 
least-cost strategies are to be identified for each scenario considered in this project, the tools used 
for energy planning must be capable of optimization. Also, the tools must be suited for the size of the 
energy systems of the country and must lend itself to integration of country results to study all 
aspects of energy substitution.
2. The key considerations involved in selection of energy planning tools are as follows:-
 The planning horizon; 
 The focus on short versus medium and long-term need; 
 The confidence in historical data describing the economy and the energy industry; 
 The need to take into account regional issues versus national issues; regional issues are 
usually significant when an energy system is small and there are one or two large load 
centres and many regional load centres at various stages of development; 
 The maturity of the energy sector and the degree to which fuel substitution is evidenced; 
in particular the role that natural gas plays, within the context of the economy, is a critical 
issue; and
 The suitability of the planning tools for transfer to energy planning staff in the responsible 
Ministries. 
3. The Consultant has worked to a planning horizon spanning the years 2014 to 2035. This 
planning horizon of slightly more than 20 years is relatively short. Given the social reforms that are 
taking place in Myanmar, and the uncertainty surrounding the economic growth outlook, a 20 year 
planning horizon is considered to be the longest period for a meaningful energy planning study.
4. In regards to the energy needs of Myanmar, it is clear that the focus is on the short to 
medium-term. The current shortfall in electricity supply and declining on-shore production of liquid 
fuels point to the need for near-term action. 
5. Confidence in historical performance data is somewhat mixed. There is no shortage of 
literature in the public domain, wherein consultants and analysts have questioned the accuracy of 
economic and technical data reported by the Government of Myanmar. Whilst the experience of the 
ADB Consultant has been generally positive with regard to data accuracy, nevertheless the 
confidence is considerably less than is the case for transition and OECD-economy countries.
6. Myanmar’s energy system is small and characterized by the very large load centre of 
Yangon, a moderate size centre of Mandalay, and a range of State/Region centres at different levels 
of development. Myanmar is a long country, from south to north, with marked differences in topology 
and climate. As a result there are three agricultural zones and three fuel zones to consider. Energy 
planning from a national perspective only will not deal adequately with this mixed presentation; B4 
some level of disaggregation to regional level is needed. 
7. Myanmar’s energy system is relatively immature when compared to those of developed world 
countries. This is not a comment on the maturity of the energy technologies in use; rather it 
highlights the shortage of gas available for domestic use. In the coming years, gas supplies might be 
expected to increase and so the potential for fuel substitution. This means that energy planning tools 
must be able to evaluate the optimal use of gas across the economy. 
8. Energy planning tools come with various levels of sophistication. It is understood that energy 
planning staff in the Ministries have had exposure to a moderately sophisticated energy planning 
package called LEAP. It is understood that the planning staff involved came away with the opinion 
that it was too soon to apply such a model in Myanmar. The lack of reliable data in particular was a 
concern, along with general concerns regarding the lack of transparency with such a model. 
9. With reference to the key considerations outlined above as bullet points, and the ensuing 
discussion points, the Consultant considers that the best approach to energy modelling is a 
bottom-up optimization / accounting approach applied at regional level. Considering the energy 
planning tools that are applied consistently throughout the world, and their characteristics, this leads 
to the conclusion that individual economic sector models are most appropriate for Myanmar at the 
present time. The tools and their characteristics are tabled as follows:-

10. There are advantages and disadvantages in using sector models for energy planning 
 Sector models better facilitate training in the concepts involved in sector planning as the 
models are transparent; 
 Sector models are weak when it comes to modelling fuel substitution effects; however in 
Myanmar the key issue is the use of gas and the allocation can be readily tested by B5 
sector, notably the diversion of gas for fertilizer and / or CNG-fuelled vehicles, versus the 
savings that could be gained if the gas is instead used for power generation; and
 The sector model approach supports the use of a long-term planning tool, such as LEAP 
or MARKAL / TIMES, because the accurate calibration of sector energy consumption 
against historical fuel production/imports will ultimately provide a high level of confidence 
in historical data; this confidence is a pre-requisite for setting parameters within the more 
sophisticated planning packages. In future such multi-criteria optimisation models could 
be developed for Yangon Division and the rest of the country, or for north and south 
partitions of the country. 
11. A final comment regarding the MARKAL / TIMES planning package is that the power of the 
software is fully released when consumer price behaviour is included in the model. At the present 
time there is insufficient knowledge of consumer behaviour to support such an approach, particularly 
in the rural sector. A possible evolution would be to develop a simple MARKAL / TIMES model for a 
typical rural village. This model could later be integrated into a national model thereby ensuring that 
energy consumption of the country is correctly characterized at the consumer end.
B. Myanmar Energy Planning Model
12. The energy planning model developed to support the development of Myanmar’s Energy 
Masterplan is based on a modular approach. The model comprises separate demand side and 
supply side components as shown in Figure 0-2.
13. On the demand side, the economic and household sectors are modelled as separate 
modules. Each of these modules contains bottom-up and top-down historical data used for 
calibration purposes. Forecasts are developed within each module according to the economic or 
other relevant growth drivers, e.g. GDP per capita.
14. On the supply side, the optimization of electricity supply is performed according to economic 
despatch principles. This is because electricity cannot be stored and supply and demand must be 
balanced at all times according to economic least-cost supply principles (for a given supply 
scenario). In the case of liquid fuels the petroleum product requirement is expressed in the form of a 
refinery slate. The least cost supply of petroleum products is determined by a conventional 
economic evaluation of alternatives, including off-shore and on-shore oil purchase, on-shore 
refining, import of petroleum products. Total upstream energy costs are determined simply 
according to volumes supplied and price rates for each petroleum product. 
15. Gas supply is modelled by constraining the supply of gas to relevant individual sectors. B6

16. Further details of the energy planning modules are discussed in the sections that follow. At 
the time of preparation of these notes, the GDP growth and demand-side models were fully 
complete. Not shown in Figure 0-2 is an electricity forecast module. Electricity forecasts are 
prepared in a single module according to consumer class (residential, commercial, light industrial, 
industrial, Government and agriculture) then disaggregated by household, commercial and industry 
sectors where other energy forms are added to account for the total energy consumption of the 
sector (e.g. diesel, wood fuel, etc).
17. Some further minor development may be required to apply the electricity economic dispatch 
model to the Myanmar system; at this time it is not decided whether the economic dispatch 
modelling will be undertaken separately for Yangon Division and the southernmost portion of the 
country, on a fully integrated national basis, or both if a particular expansion scenario of interest
should require it. 
C. GDP Growth Module
18. The GDP growth model is based on an overall target growth rate for the economy, and 
disaggregated targets for individual sectors viz a viz, the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors. 
The model also forecasts manpower needs by sector as well as specifically for the agriculture 
sub-sector. These forecasts are used in the consideration of farm mechanization. The details are 
provided in the Economic Outlook report.
D. Transport Module
19. There are several approaches that could be used to model transport sector demand. 
International transport research centres tend to favour a bottom-up approach where the objective is 
fuel consumption and energy analysis. A bottom up approach is a disaggregated analysis of the 
transportation system as a provider of energy services. The calculation of energy demand in terms 
of services performed (‘useful’ energy) as opposed to the amount of energy supplied (‘final’ energy), 
offers a better understanding of the substitution between alternative energy forms, as well as an 
appraisal of the effect that evolution of the technological improvements has on demand. Such 
insights are essential in developing energy policy.
20. In a bottom-up approach, energy consumption by the transport sector is directly driven by two 
factors: vehicle-km travelled, and conversion efficiency of the vehicle (whether a road, rail, waterway 
or air vehicle). Vehicle-kms travelled are in turn driven by the needs of society and the economy to 
move people and goods from place to place. Conversion efficiency depends mostly on the 
underlying technology, i.e. the type of vehicle, fuel and vintage that makes up the vehicle ‘parc’
1
, and 
to some degree the patterns of utilisation of that technology. It is a best practice to treat passenger 
transport and freight transport separately, as the need for mobility by people and goods have 
different drivers and technologies. 
 
1 The vehicle ‘parc’ is a term used to describe the total number of active vehicles on the roadB8

E. Agriculture Module
21. The calculation of agriculture sector energy demand is based on the farm energy forecasting 
model depicted in Figure 0-4 below. The model determines the total commercial energy requirement 
(for irrigation), and the total mechanization energy requirement (tractors and other machinery). 
Furthermore the model determines the efficiency of converting solar energy by agriculture as it 
increases through the additional input of energy from humans, animals, machinery, fertilizer, 
manure, pesticide, irrigation fuel (petroleum and electricity), as well as from water and seeds. The 
details are provided in the Primary Sector Demand Forecast report.
22. The agriculture sector requires fertilizer, and the option exists to manufacture on-shore or to 
import. The production of urea requires gas as a fuel supply and as a feedstock. The agriculture 
module is designed such that a change in fertilizer load per hectare can be accounted for in the 
sector energy balance and in terms of GDP impact. This means that as the gas supply allocation to 
the agriculture sector is varied the net benefit can be assessed in terms of farm sector GDP 
contribution. The economic benefits can then be understood in relation to the cost saving associated 
with local fertilizer production (usually fertilizer imports are more costly). B9

F. Rural HH Lighting Module
23. Rural household lighting energy analysis is concerned with the determination of the existing 
stock of lighting appliances in use by household income bracket. End-use behaviour is established 
by survey. When both the stock and usage are known, the household lux (illumination per square B10
metre) can be estimated. Household lux is a measure of the demand for lighting services. 
24. The demand for lighting services can be met in different ways, and a model is required to 
forecast the optimal supply from standpoint of lux and total cost of ownership. Once the trade-offs 
are understood an energy policy can be developed. The form of the lighting module is as follows:-

G. Rural HH Cooking Module
25. The same principles apply to rural HH cooking energy as described above for lighting, with 
final cooking energy substituting for lux. The form of the cooking energy module is as follows:-
Figure 0-6: Rural HH Cooking Energy Planning Module

H. Electricity Forecasts 
26. Electricity forecasts are produced based on bottom-up and top-down forecasting methods.
27. For bottom-up forecasting there are typically five methods that can be applied 1) Land-based, 
2) Customer-based, 3) Percentage growth, 4) Trend-method, and 5) Geo-spatial based approach. In 
practice a combination of these techniques is usually necessary.
28. For top-down forecasting the typical method is econometric regression 
29. For the Energy Masterplan, the bottom-up methods used are 2), 3) and 4). The details are 
described in the Electricity Forecast report. Further details will be provided as part of knowledge B12
transfer as appropriate to the level of knowledge of Ministry staff participating in training.
30. In summary however, the key features of the forecasting model are as follows:-
 kWh per consumer type is used as a basic indicator;
 Population growth and kWh per household are used for residential forecasts
 Commercial and light industrial forecasts were based on trending + known 
developments;
 Industrial zone growth was based on Gompertz curves (using Monte Carlo 
techniques); and
 Regression methods and measured demand data were used for validation.
I. Electricity Supply Optimization
31. For an Energy Masterplan it is important to formulate policy-driven supply portfolio 
alternatives and to compare them on a net present cost basis. This requires basic economic 
dispatch modelling to forecast individual plant output, and a financial evaluation model that handles 
capital investment (including disbursement profiles for new plants), and the forecast production, to 
determine levelized costs of energy for the portfolio. For a policy-driven expansion planning, a 
prioritization and ranking criteria model is also required to weight and score each expansion 
alternative according to a set of agreed criteria, including a net present cost criterion.
32. MoEP is using the software package WASP for electricity supply expansion planning. WASP 
is a software tool that contains an economic dispatch optimization engine and this tool can be used 
to test supply expansion alternatives. However, in the interests of time, the Consultant will carry out 
a basic economic dispatch modelling using a bespoke modelling tool. The bespoke model is not a 
commercial model and will not be provided. However, the theory of economic dispatch optimization 
can be given as part of training if required. The financial evaluation model will be provided in the 
form of an Excel spreadsheet. Unlike WASP, this model is open and transparent and will support 
training in economic evaluation for a power system if required. The prioritization and ranking model 
will also be provided with familiarization training as required.
33. It is envisaged that in future the updating of the expansion plan could be carried out using
WASP to generate the production outputs of a given portfolio of interest. The production figures 
could be submitted to the financial evaluation model or the financial calculations of WASP could be 
used for the purpose of policy-based prioritization and ranking.
J. Petroleum Products Supply Optimization
34. The petroleum products supply optimization is modelled using standard economic evaluation 
techniques to determine the optimal supply option from amongst on- and off-shore options. 
35. The determination of on-shore refinery costs and refinery product prices, for a given demand 
slate, is a specialized task undertaken by only a handful of international firms. For a simple refinery 
structure, benchmark costs can be used without loss of accuracy.Project Number: TA No. 8356-MYA

APPENDIX B: LIFT Baseline Survey Extracts C3 
I. INTRODUCTION 
1. As part of TA-8356, the Terms of Reference (TOR) requires the Consultant to “conduct the 
surveys on the use of energy in various sectors”. It is understood from the inception phase that the 
energy surveys were to focus on end-use energy consumption, which is consistent with the MOE’s 
perspective that end use energy consumption data has the greatest level of uncertainty. 
2. The energy consumption surveys have the intent of enhancing our understanding of energy 
consumption trends in Myanmar, which in turn will enhance the level of confidence in the quality of 
the data that is used to inform the energy demand forecasts that underpin the Energy Master Plan 
(EMP). The surveys should also assist in being able to develop more accurate historical energy
balances, which become the baseline for the energy sector projections.
3. Following an assessment of data availability with in the ministries, other previous survey work 
in Myanmar and a general consideration of where the energy survey work could best assist this 
project, the Consultant recommended in the Inception Report that the main focus areas of the 
energy consumption surveys be in the following areas: 
 Rural and urban household (HH) energy consumption; 
 Private industry energy consumption; and 
 Commercial sector energy consumption. 
4. Of the three areas identified above, the rural and urban HH energy surveys were identified to 
be the highest priority since they correspond the area for which the least amount of information is 
available. Furthermore, surveys of this nature take considerable time to plan and execute. Hence 
the focus of survey work during the initial stages of the project has been to focus on executing a 
rural and urban HH energy survey. The purpose of this discussion paper is to describe the present 
state of the urban and rural household survey work that is being undertaken. 
5. This paper has been organised as follows: 
 Section II provides a preliminary review of other survey work, the intent is to leverage any 
insights from previous work and understand the nature of any publicly available data sets 
that offer insights into rural and urban HH energy consumption trends in Myanmar; 
 Section III then sets out the methodology that we have adopted for the HH energy 
consumption survey. Because this is a work in progress, we briefly touch upon the 
present state of field work execution; 
 Appendix A provides a copy of the HH energy survey that was used; and 
 Appendix B provides relevant supporting data from a previously conducted study. 
6. It should be noted that this paper contains preliminary findings for discussion. At the time of 
writing the HH energy consumption surveys were ongoing and thus we can only present the data 
that was provided by the energy survey team as of 1 June 2014. We expect to be able to provide a 
far more comprehensive presentation of HH energy consumption trends at the draft report stage. C4 
II. REVIEW OF PREVIOUS SURVEYS IN MYANMAR 
A. Previous Work 
7. A number of surveys have been recently undertaken in Myanmar that provides insight into 
energy consumption trends. It is important to briefly review the nature and scope of these surveys 
as the household survey that we have conducted can be thought to essentially complement these 
surveys and enhance our overall understanding of present energy consumption trends in Myanmar. 
8. Two recent and relevant surveys that have been undertaken include: (i) The Livelihoods for 
Fuel Security Trust (LIFT) baseline survey, a joint funding effort by multiple donors1 conducted in 
2012 to provide a comprehensive assessment of rural households in general2, and (ii) a MercyCorps 
Poverty Survey, which focused on the issue of Fuel Efficient Stoves (FES), and was conducted in 
2011. 
B. LIFT Baseline Survey 
9. LIFT baseline survey’s objective was to gain a better understanding of trends in the rural 
households of Myanmar. The Livelihoods for Food Security Trust (LIFT) conducted a survey 
covering 4,000 rural households to seek information concerning fuel use for cooking and lighting by 
residence zone and income deciles. 
10. Methodology. The surveyed locations included the Hilly, Dry and Delta/Coastal 
agro-ecological zones of Myanmar. Four thousand households were chosen from 252 villages with 
probability proportional to their number of households. Specifically, eight-hundred households were 
randomly selected from each zone (coastal/delta, hilly and dry) 800 from Rakhine (Giri-affected 
areas), and 800 as a control. By income, the respondents were grouped into deciles (10 categories), 
ranging from earning less than Ks 25,000 to over Ks 300,000 per household per month.
11. Summary of key findings:
 Overall, only 7% of the sample households were connected to the electricity grid; ranging 
from maximum of 16% of households in the Hilly Zone to less than 1% of households in 
the Giri-affected areas. Similarly households from the Hilly Zone were most likely to be 
connected to a village generator (15.6%) or have their own generator (3.8%). By contrast 
households in Giri-affected areas were most likely to use candles for lighting (55%) and 
households in the Delta/Coastal Zone most likely to use a kerosene or oil lamp (60%). 
Households in the Dry Zone were the second most connected to the grid (11%) but most 
likely to share a generator with other households (11%). 
 Á it can be expected, access to electricity either from the grid or generators (other than 
village generators) was correlated with level of household average monthly income. In 
general, the larger the household average monthly income the more likely the household

had electricity from the grid, had its own generator or shared a generator with other 
households. Conversely the poorer the household the more likely it used candles or 
lamps for lighting. 
 Sources of cooking fuel were similar between regions with a very high reliance on fuel 
wood. The use of fuel wood ranged from a low of 90% of households in the Delta/Coastal 
Zone to a high of 99% of households in Giri-affected areas. 
 Firewood collection and sale was an important source of income for poor households. In 
some cases especially the Giri-affected villages the community had to travel long 
distances to collect fuel wood. These results suggest that community forestry, 
agroforestry and fuel efficient stoves may be important areas for support in some 
locations. 
12. Appendix B has tabulated a number of extracts from the LIFT baseline survey. 
C. MercyCorps Energy Poverty Survey (2011) 
13. MercyCorps Energy Poverty Survey objective: The Energy Poverty Survey was conducted 
with a focus to analyse village households’ energy consumption and a market for FES’s. 
14. Methodology: The samples were taken for 396 households from 18 villages (22 HHs each) in 
22 village tracts of Laputta Township.
15. Results: The main findings of the survey are summarised for cooking, firewood collection and 
lighting in the following paragraphs. 
16. Cooking: 
 The majority of households (88%) use wood, either with open fire or “three-stone” method 
(69%) or with a fuel efficient stove (19%) for cooking and heating water. 10% use plain 
rice husk (not compressed into bricks). Other fuel types used by some households are 
charcoal (1%) and electricity grid (1%). 
 The most preferred type of fuel for cooking is wood with FES (42% of total respondent 
households), followed by wood with open fire (22%), electricity grid (18%), charcoal 
(11%), and rice husk (5%). 
 The reasons, stated by the households, for preferring wood-burning FES are as follows:
(i) Convenient and easy to use, (ii) Wood is easier to buy and more affordable than 
charcoal, (iii) FES are less of a fire hazard and are safer for children, (iv) FES can reduce 
deforestation 
17. Firewood collection: 
 Overall, 61% of wood-fuel is purchased and 38% is collected. Significantly, 43% of the 
respondents buy 100% of firewood because there is no longer any wood collector in the 
household. An average of 233 hours per year is spent by a household for collecting the 
firework. C6 
 Households get the firewood mainly from state land resources (reserve areas) (49%) and 
personal forest resources (29%). Some get it from community forest resources (12%) and 
privately held forest resources (4%). 
18. Household Lighting:
 The majority of households (56%) use diesel lamps, followed by 29% using power from 
the electricity grid as the main fuel sources for lighting. Other fuel types used by some 
households are candle (9%), and battery (6%). 
 The most preferred type of fuel for lighting is electricity grid (55% of total respondent 
households), followed by diesel lamps (25%), and battery-powered lamps (18%). The 
rest prefer solar (1%) and candle (0.3%). 
 The common reasons, stated by the households, for preferring the electricity grid, diesel 
and battery are as follows: (i) Good quality lighting power, (ii) More affordable, (iii) 
Convenient and easy to use, (iv) Can use anytime, (v) More suitable for business and 
income generating work, (vi) Reduced fire hazard, (v) Can use for any social activities 
and (vi) Can use for education (studying at night) 
 Households can afford an average of 3.8 hours of light per night although they would like 
5 hours on average. 
III. URBAN AND RURAL HOUSEHOLD ENERGY CONSUMTPION SURVEY DESIGN 
D. Broad Design Parameters 
19. A key constraint in undertaking the rural and urban HH energy consumption survey is time 
and budget. As noted, we have identified, collected and compiled as much of the relevant existing 
data sets that we have been able to locate, but we observe that they are not necessarily complete 
from a holistic energy consumption perspective; for example, electricity consumption data will not 
include other fuel inputs, similarly, the central statistics office data does not necessarily provide the 
type of coverage that would be ideal. 
20. As such we need to complement the collection of existing data exercise with surveys that 
target the gaps in our knowledge and/or that can in some way confirm or enhance the quality of the 
data that already exists. For the rural and urban HH energy consumption survey, we have 
attempted to fill that gap. However, it should be noted that a key practical constraint that had to be 
satisfied in the design was being limited to 700 HH surveys. Furthermore, the level of detail in the 
surveys themselves needs to be carefully managed so that they can be quickly completed “on the 
fly”. Another important consideration is to ensure adequate coverage of different income brackets 
and trends within the different “fuel zones” of Myanmar. 
21. In consultation with the national consultants who have a firmer grasp on what can be 
achieved and what areas can be readily accessed, we have arrived at the survey approach that is 
documented in Table III-1. Note that some of the regions can be covered with minimal barriers 
owing to the fact that the local government or community leaders already have experience in having 
surveys conducted their regions / townships. Other regions are more problematic as the local C7 
government may oppose having the survey issued or may wish to have control over the questions 
asked. As such Table III-1 is essentially a “compromise” between all of the factors that have had to 
be taken into account in the design of the HH energy consumption.

E. Household Energy Questionnaire Design 
22. The questionnaire for the household energy consumption survey was designed with 
consideration of the results of the previous surveys by LIFT and MercyCorps. The focus was to 
gather information on fuel end-user patterns, which could supplement the previous findings in 
establishing an estimate of energy consumption by rural households.
23. The survey questionnaire consists of 14 parts (A to N), in detail as follows:C8 
A. Household information: to gather information about the location and type of 
household including the size of the house and the number of occupants.
B. Household income and expenses: Covers the monthly income, expenses on different 
energy needs and the other household expenditure. 
C. Household appliances: Information about appliances by purpose and fuel used, and 
the respondent’s preference in terms of appliances’ importance. 
D. Energy uses – Cooking: Types of coking ovens, daily cooking duration, cooking 
fuel types, and quantity of fuel used in month.
E. Energy uses – Lighting: Types of lighting appliances, the time and duration of use, 
and main fuel sources.
F. Energy uses – Water heating: Types of appliances, duration of use and main fuel 
sources. 
G. Total non-electricity fuel consumption: Information about quantities of different 
non-electricity types of fuel used by the household each month.
H. Electricity supply: Whether the household is connected to the power grid and (if yes) 
what purposes the electricity is used for. 
I. Past energy usage: To compare the consumption between this and the last year.
J. Fuel source and usage: For enquiring whether the household pays for the fuel they 
need or gets any of it for free, purchases from market or gets the fuel delivered by 
someone else, what is the form of payment and how often it is made?
K. Generators: Information about whether the household has a generator and the 
features of the generator if they own one, including the fuel type and quantity 
consumed.
L. Motor vehicles: Whether the household has a vehicle, vehicle type and fuel type,
quantity of fuel consumed, and how it is obtained. 
M. Agriculture energy: Types of equipment and fuel used for farming activities. 
N. Solar power: Whether the household has a solar panel installed.
24. A complete copy of the HH energy consumption is provided in Appendix A.
F. Approach to Survey Fieldwork 
25. Prior to undertaking HH energy consumption survey the following was undertaken: 
 The MOE provided an endorsement letter for the survey work and to also explain how the 
energy consumption results will feed into a process of national energy planning; 
 An advocacy process then was required for each local / regional authority to get their 
buy-in and endorsement; and 
 A survey team was formed and the national consultant leading the HH energy survey 
undertook a series of workshops to explain the survey forms and concepts. This is to C9 
ensure that the energy survey team members fully understand the questions and to 
explain how to obtain the answers from those that are being surveyed. 
26. The survey team has then travelled to the different regions listed in Table III-1 to conduct their 
fieldwork. For each region the process was as follows: 
 The survey team met with the community leader and village volunteers for a consultation 
workshop, which involved explaining survey content and its objectives, which is extremely 
important to ensuring buy-in from the community leader – in general, it was explained that 
the survey is intended for national planning purposes and the community leader 
supported the initiative. An illustration of this occurring in the Ngaputaw Township, 
Ayeyarwaddy is illustrated in Figure III-1. 
 The community leader then assisted the survey team in terms of the HH selection 
process in order to maximise the coverage of different income levels. Furthermore, 
volunteers within the community would be recruited to facilitate the survey team in 
conducting their field work. An illustration of this is given in Figure III-2. 
 A basic strategy was devised to then carry out the HH survey in the village for the sample 
of HHs. 
 The approach to taking the surveys was then generally perform a combination of 
door-to-door surveys or selected HH occupants were invited to a temporary office to 
come and fill out the survey. An example is illustrated in Figure III-3. 
 Finally those completing the survey were provided with a small gift, as illustrated in Figure 
III-4. 
27. The remaining part in the process is then for the survey team to compile the results of the 
surveys into spreadsheets to enable data analysis. 
G. Actual numbers of surveyed regions and households 
28. In total, 967 surveys were conducted in 11 regions across Myanmar. Table III-2 lists the 
regions and townships where the surveys took place; it also shows the number of surveyed 
households in each location. Geographical spread of the surveyed areas is showed in Figure III-5.C10

Household Energy Consumption Survey
Purpose of this survey
The Ministry of Energy (MOE) is conducting a household energy survey in order to gain a better understanding of energy 
consumption patterns in Myanmar households. This survey is intended to collect data on the types and quantities of 
energy consumed in households in Myanmar. This information will be used by the MOE for the purpose of enhancing 
energy planning, with the longer-term objective being to enhance energy access in the country.
Your participation is important

A. BACKGROUND
1. During the 6
th Electric Power Sector Working Group Meeting organized in Nay Pyi Taw, on 23rd
February 2015, key government participants and development partners (DPs) discussed recent activities 
in the energy and power sector. In his opening remarks, Deputy Minister H.E. U Aung Than Oo stressed 
the need for consistency in concurrent energy and power sector master plans being formulated for 
relevant Myanmar Government agencies1 with Asian Development Bank (ADB), Japan International 
Cooperation Agency (JICA), and World Bank Group (WBG) support, including:
a) Myanmar Energy Master Plan (EMP) – ADB
b) National Electricity Master Plan (NEMP) – JICA
c) Myanmar National Electricity Plan – WBG
2. ADB's EMP study has completed energy surveys and data collection, historical energy balances, 
primary energy resource assessments, and energy demand forecasts. The remaining chapters of the 
EMP concern recommendations on supply options and investment requirements in the power sector as 
well as finalization of total primary energy supply forecasts and the final energy balance reflecting fuel 
requirements identified from the optimal generation expansion plan. 
3. As JICA's NEMP study finalized generation expansion plans using the Wien Automation System 
Planning model (WASP IV) for a high growth case2, ADB decided and MOE/NEMC agreed to complete the 
remaining chapter using WASP IV to analyze a medium growth case3
, to provide robust results and 
ensure consistency between the EMP and NEMP studies. 
 
1
 The relevant Myanmar Government agencies include: MOE (Ministry of Energy); MOEP (Ministry of Electric 
Power); NEMC (National Energy Management Committee) 
2
 In the NEMP study, a macro and top-down approach is applied to project electric power demand growth rate by 
multiplying elasticity and GDP growth rate. The elasticity of 1.4 is used based on its analysis of the average 
elasticity during 2002-2010 and GDP growth rate for 2013-2030 is assumed as (i) for a high growth case, 8.7% 
which is the growth rate of 2011-2012, and (ii) for a low growth case, 6.4% based on IMF Economic Outlook. As a 
result, peak demand in 2030 is projected as 14.5 GW for its high growth case and 9.1 GW for its low growth case. 
The NEMP study analyzed the high growth case as a base case for preparing power expansion plan. 
3
 In the EMP study, a micro and bottom-up approach is applied to project electric power demand by examining 
historical consumption and demand trends of households, commercial, agriculture, and industrial sectors for each 
of the 14 states and regions of Myanmar. Electricity consumption drivers are for (i) households: cooking , lighting, 
water heating, TV / entertainment and cooling services; (ii) commercial: restaurants, hotels, retail space, office 
space, (iii) agriculture: tractors, power tillers, harvesters, irrigation pumps, and (iv) industry: production of steel, 
non-metallic minerals (bricks, cement, glass), non-metallic metals (copper, zinc, tin), food (sugar), electronics, 
plastics, ice storage, food processing, automotive parts, footwear and garments. GDP growth rate for 2013-2030 is 
assumed as (i) for a high growth case, 9.5% which is the highest growth rate forecasted from ADB’s Country 
Diagnostic Study (CDS, 2014), (ii) for a medium growth scenario, 7.1% which is the government growth forecast, 
and (iii) for a low growth scenario, 4.8% which is the lowest growth rate forecasted from ADB’s CDS. As a result, B. OBJECTIVES
4. The objective of this study is to apply the WASP IV model in identifying an optimum generation 
expansion plan for the Myanmar power sector, and determine the associated system costs, fuel 
requirements, and environmental emissions under the EMP's medium growth case. 
5. Study assumptions are to be consistent with the NEMP, while making adjustments based on 
additional information and insights provided by relevant Myanmar Government agencies, DPs, and 
project personnel. 
6. The ADB consultants for this engagement are tasked with: (i) Assembling all required data for 
executing WASP IV in consultation with the MOEP and JICA consultants; (ii) Developing plausible 
generation expansion scenarios in consultation with the MOE, MOEP, NEMC and ADB; (iii) Executing 
WASP IV to identify the optimum generation expansion plan under the EMP's medium growth case; and 
(iv) Drafting this chapter on the National Power Expansion Plan as part of the EMP report. 
II. MODELING APPROACH 
C. DESCRIPTION OF THE WASP MODEL 
7. WASP is an optimization model for examining medium- to long-term development options for 
electrical generating systems. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) distributes and maintains 
this model, which is the public domain's most frequently used program for expansion planning of 
electrical generating systems. 
8. The latest version of the model, called WASP IV, is designed to find the economically optimal
generation expansion policy for an electric utility system. It utilizes probabilistic estimation of system 
production costs, unserved energy cost, and reliability, a linear programming technique for determining 
optimum dispatch policy satisfying exogenous constraints on environmental emissions, fuel availability 
and electricity generation by groups of plants, and the dynamic programming method of optimization
for comparing the costs of alternative system expansion policies. 
9. WASP IV permits finding the optimal expansion plan for a power generating system over a 
period of up to thirty years, within constraints given by the planner. The optimum solution is evaluated 
in terms of minimum discounted total costs. Each possible sequence of power unit additions that meets 
the specified constraints is evaluated by means of a cost function (i.e., the “objective function”) 
represented by the following equation: 
 
peak demand in 2030 is projected as 13.4 GW for a high growth case, 9.5 GW for a medium growth case, and 6.8 
GW for a low growth case. The EMP study is using the medium growth case as a base case for estimating fuel 
requirements from all sectors including power sector.

10. WASP IV comprises the following eight modules. 
11. LOADSY (Load System Description): Processes information describing the peak loads and load 
duration curves for up to 30 years. The objective of LOADSY is to prepare all the demand information 
needed by subsequent modules. 
12. FIXSYS (Fixed System Description): Processes information describing the existing generating 
system. This includes performance and cost characteristics of all generating units in the system at the 
start of the study period and a list of retirements and "fixed" additions to the system. Fixed additions 
are power plants already committed and not subject to change. 
13. VARSYS (Variable System Description): Processes information describing the various generating 
units to be considered as candidates for expanding the generating system. 
14. CONGEN (Configuration Generator): Calculates all possible year-to-year combinations of 
expansion candidate additions that satisfy certain input constraints and that, in combination with the 
existing system, can adequately meet the electricity demand. 
15. MERSIM (Merge and Simulate): Considers all configurations put forward by CONGEN and uses 
probabilistic simulation of system operation to calculate the associated production costs, unserved 
energy, and system reliability for each configuration. The module also calculates plant loading orders 
and maintenance schedules. 
16. DYNPRO (Dynamic Programming Optimization): Determines the optimum expansion plan as 
based on previously derived operating costs along with input information on capital cost, economic 
parameters, unserved energy cost, and system reliability constraints. 
17. REMERSIM (Re-MERSIM): Simulates the configurations contained in the optimized solution. By 
providing a detailed output of the simulation, REMERSIM allows the user to analyze particular 
components of the production-cost calculation, such as unit-by-unit capacity factors and fuel 
requirements for each season and hydroelectric condition. 
18. REPROBAT (Report Writer of WASP): Writes a report summarizing the results for the optimum
power system expansion plan. III. STUDY PARAMETERS

22. Consistent with NEMP study assumptions, this study uses a discount rate of 10% in the present 
worth discounting of costs to the reference year of 2013.
G. RESERVE MARGIN 
23. Reserve Margin and Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) are common approaches for introducing 
reliability into system planning. The Asia Pacific Energy Research Centre (APERC) reports while Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore require a 30 percent reserve margin, other areas in the region define 
reliable service as maintaining an LOLP no greater than 1 day per year.4 
24. System reserve margin is a reliability criteria used in WASP IV. When simulating system 
operations in each year, WASP IV identifies the “critical period” as the period of the year for which the 
difference between corresponding available generating capacity and peak demand has the smallest 
value. For a configuration of unit additions to satisfy the reserve margin constraint, the installed 
capacity in the critical period must lie between the given minimum and maximum reserve margins 
above the peak demand in the critical period of the year. 
25. A minimum reserve margin of 20% is applied in this study. As countries in the region typically 
use a value between 15% to 30% for planning purposes, sensitivity analyses should be performed to 
evaluate the costs and benefits of a more or less stringent reserve margin constraint. 
H. COST OF ENERGY NOT SERVED
26. Energy not Served (ENS) is the amount of energy required by the system, which cannot be 
supplied by the generating equipment existing in the system. WASP IV computes ENS in GWh. 
27. The planner can specify a cost of unserved energy (CUE) in US$/kWh representing the average 
loss to the economy due to unsupplied electrical energy. Approaches for estimating CUE include the 
production loss method – relating the value of lost production to the loss of power supply, the 
captive generation method – estimating the extra cost incurred by consumers that must rely on 
alternative or back-up power generation, and the willingness to pay method – determining a value 
based on surveys of consumer’s willingness to pay for a reliable and uninterrupted electricity supply. 
28. In the absence of reference evaluations of estimated outage costs to consumers in Myanmar, 
the ADB consultant chose to remain consistent with the NEMP and apply a CUE of 1.0 US$/kWh in this 
study. In comparison, a survey of the production loss for twelve major industries in Bangladesh reports 
the associated average cost of unplanned outages at 0.83 US$/kWh.5
I. LOSS OF LOAD PROBABILITY
29. LOLP is defined as the percentage of time during which the system load exceeds the available 
generating capacity of the system. For example, a cumulative failure duration of one (1) day per year has 
a corresponding LOLP of 0.274%. 
30. As noted in a recent ADB study report, the security and reliability requirements in Lao PDR 
specify a maximum cumulative failure duration for the generating system of 5.5 days/year, while 
 
4 Electric Power Grid Interconnections in the APEC Region, APERC, 2004 
5 Energy Strategy Approach Paper Annexes, Sustainable Development Network, WBG, Oct 2009 planning criteria in Thailand call for LOLP not more than 24 hours per year.6 The planning criteria 
adopted by the Korea Power Exchange (KPX) calls for a maximum LOLP of 12 hours per year.7 
31. This study specifies a maximum system LOLP of 24 hours per year to be met beginning in 2025. 
IV. ELECTRICITY DEMAND 
J. DEMAND FORECAST
32. As part of the EMP, IES/MMI prepared an electricity demand forecast using a “bottom-up” 
approach for agriculture, industry, transport and household power and energy demand. The report 
examines energy trends by region and by customer class and aggregates the results, including system 
losses, to provide one consolidated electricity demand forecast for the country. The EMP postulates 
three demand forecasts: high (11.7% CAGR), medium (9.6% CAGR) and low (7.6%CAGR). 
33. The medium demand forecast used in this study is displayed in Table 1. Under this forecast the 
country’s electricity demand is expected to grow from 1,853 MW in 2013 to 9,465 MW in 2030. The 
annual energy generation requirement grows in line with demand to reach 58,336 GWh in 2030.

Peak Load GenerationK. SEASONAL LOAD CHARACTERISTICS
34. In order to better capture the variability in system load characteristics and hydro power plant 
operations, the ADB consultant developed the EMP WASP IV database enable the model to operate with 
12 periods per year. 
35. At the advice of staff of the MOEP National Control Center, hourly systems loads for 2014, as 
represented in Figure 1, were used to define seasonal load characteristics as input to the EMP power 
expansion study. 
Source: MOEP
 Figure 1: 2014 Hourly System Loads 
36. The PRELOAD program was used to read in the 8760 values of hourly system load and create 
representative period load duration curves and peak load ratios required as input to WASP. The 
computed period peak load ratios are displayed in Table 2. 
Table 2: Period Peak Load Ratios

V. EXISTING GENERATING SYSTEM 
37. In 2013, Myanmar produced 11,681 GWh of electricity, the bulk of which was from hydropower 
(73%), followed by gas-fired (25%) and coal-fired (2%) generation. (source: MOEP) 
38. As of March 2013, actual installed capacity for Myanmar is 2,259 MW of hydropower, 363 MW 
of gas power plants, and one 30 MW coal power plant. (source: JICA Study Team) 
Period 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

system reserve drops significantly in the dry season when hydropower plants receive insufficient water 
to generate at full capacity. 
L. THERMAL POWER PLANTS
40. Existing gas-fired plants depend on domestic supply from the Yadana, Zawtika, and Shwe gas 
fields. As noted in Table 3, up to 261 bbtud (billion British Thermal Units per day) of gas is currently 
allocated to the power sector. This maximum volume is not expected to be increased until 
commissioning of the new gas field of M-3 in 2019. Imported gas and high speed diesel is considered for 
use in satisfying potential near term supply shortages. 
Table 3: Domestic Gas Supply for Electricity through 2018 (bbtud) 
Source: Newjec, NEMP 2014
41. The allocation of domestic gas supply to the power sector is expected to increase following 
commissioning of the new gas field of M-3 in 2019. 
Table 4: Domestic Gas Supply for Electricity after Commissioning of M-3 Gas Field (bbtud) 
Source: Newjec, NEMP 2014
42. As the NEMP reports Yadana gas has a substantially lower heating value than gas from the 
other fields, the EMP power expansion plan includes a separate category of fuel type for Yadana gas. 
43. This study uses the fuel characteristics listed in Table 5 and operational characteristics for 
existing thermal power plants (TPPs) in Table 6, both of which are consistent with assumptions for the 
NEMP.

44. Rehabilitations to enhance the operating efficiency of several existing gas- and coal-fired power 
plants are scheduled to be completed by 2017. 
M. HYDRO POWER PLANTS
45. With support of the MOEP National Control Center and Department of Electric Power (DEP), 
ADB consultants received detailed data on historical operations of existing hydro power plants in 
Myanmar, including: hydro power plant (HPP) classification, available installed capacity, energy storage 
capacity, and monthly generation and average capacity. 
46. MOEP classifies HPPs in the following categories: 
(i) HPPs not related to reservoir 
(ii) HPPs to be operated at accord of the Irrigation Department 
(iii) HPPs to be operated by Reservoir water. 
47. The EMP WASP IV database is defined with the following two hydro types: 
 Type HYD1 includes HPPs of category (i) or (ii) (i.e., run-of-river or irrigation controlled) 
 Type HYD2 includes HPPs of category (iii) (i.e., reservoir storage). 
48. Characteristics for existing HPPs are displayed in Table 7. Based on these values, HPPs of type 
HYD1 have an average capacity factor of 58%, while the average for HPPs of type HYD2 is 36%. The 
average capacity factor for the combined set of existing HPPs is 42%. 
49. In addition to the 2,259 MW of installed hydropower capacity in 2013, 165 MW is added with 
the Phu Chuang, Nancho, Baluhaung-3, and Chipwinge-1 HPPs are commissioned in 2014, and 66 MW 
with commissioning of Chipwinge-2 in 2015.

50. Given the abundant energy resources in Myanmar, the EMP power expansion study considered 
a range of generation options, including: hydro, fossil fuel based thermal, wind and solar power. A large 
number of factors including cost of development, operation and maintenance costs, technical 
operational characteristics, impact on system reliability, and environmental effects were evaluated in 
order to consider the suitability of these candidates for system expansion. 
N. THERMAL POWER PLANTS
51. The operational characteristics for candidate thermal power plants in Table 8 are consistent 
with assumptions in the NEMP. This includes equipping new Gas Engine and Gas Turbine plants to run 
on either gas or high speed diesel. 
Table 8: Candidate Thermal Power Plant – Operational Characteristics 
Source: Consultant, Newjec NEMP 2014
52. An effort was made to harmonize capital cost assumptions between the EMP and NEMP with 
additional advice from the WBG. The capital cost for Gas Engine and Coal-fired plants are from the 
NEMP, while the value for Gas Turbine Combined Cycle (GTCC) is from IES. In addition, the capital cost 
for Gas Turbines was reduced from the original NEMP value in response to comment from the WBG. 
Thermal power plant capital cost assumptions for this study are presented in Table 9.

54. As noted in the NEMP, Myanmar has over 100 GW of hydroelectric reserves. 
55. Newjec staff consulted with MOEP to identify a list of thirty-eight (38) candidate HPPs for the 
NEMP, along with the associated installed capacity, first possible year of operation, and prioritized 
sequence of hydro developments considering distribution of HPPs with respect to load centers and 
transmission, economic, social and other factors. This same set of 38 HPPs, with a total available 
capacity for Myanmar of 6,328 MW, are included as candidates in the EMP power expansion study. 
56. With support of the MOEP DEP and Department of Hydroelectric Power Planning (DHPP), ADB 
consultants developed representative values of monthly generation, average available capacity, and 
energy storage capacity (where applicable) for candidate HPPs. Operational and cost parameters for 
these candidates are listed in Table 11. 
57. Consistent with NEMP assumptions, due to limited availability of information on the estimated 
cost of HPP candidates, an average value of $2,000 US$/MW developed by Newjec in consultation with 
MOEP applies to all HPP candidates in the EMP power expansion study.

58. With estimated reserves of 365 TWh/year from wind and 52,000 TWh/year from solar10 and the 
strong emphasis renewable energy receives in the National Energy Policy Myanmar, this study 
investigated the viability of large-scale renewable energy projects by evaluating wind and solar energy 
candidate projects in the context of the least-cost generation expansion plan. 
59. IES consultants analyzed wind speed and solar irradiation estimates in order to understand 
geographical dispersion of RE potential in the country. As illustrated in Figures 2 & 3, the analysis 
suggests that: (i) solar is better located with respect to the transmission system and distance to major 
load centres, and (ii) wind potential is generally in less favorable locations further away from existing 
transmission.

60. ADB undertook a study on renewable energy potential in Myanmar.11 This assessment, study 
and roadmap effort developed estimates of full-load hours of generation for solar PV and wind energy 
converters at different sites throughout the country. Study results were used to estimate annual forced 
outage rates for renewable candidates in the EMP power expansion plan.

 Source: H.-W. Boehnke, ASR Report, ADB TA-8356 Myanmar 2014
61. Based on the outage rate estimates for a variety of sites listed in Table 12, the EMP power 
expansion study assumes an average annual forced outage rate of 81.3% for solar PV candidates. 
62. According to members of the ADB ASR study team, global wind data suggests Myanmar has a 
few sites where wind speed reaches 6 m/s. For these sites, an estimate of available power was 
developed assuming wind energy converter operating at a height of 50m. Based on results of this 
analysis, the EMP power expansions study assumes an average annual forced outage rate of 71.4% for 
wind candidates. 
63. Another interesting observation from the renewable energy study, as illustrated in Figure 4, is 
that the strong seasonal variations of solar, wind, and hydro energy potential complement each other 
over the year.

64. While the WASP IV model was originally designed to analyze conventional thermal and 
hydroelectric generation options, planners have employed a number of special unit representations to 
analyze renewables. The most common approach is to represent renewable generation candidates as 
thermal power plants, which enables the planner to: (i) analyze viability of solar and wind generation in 
an expansion plan without having to specify a predefined scenario, (ii) produce an accurately accounting 
of annual renewable generation (through specification of planned maintenance and force outage rate) 
and cost (through specification of capital cost and fixed O&M), and (iii) evaluate the impact of 
renewables on system reliability. Others have commented on the merits of this type of approach to

the referenced National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) publication: 
If time-of-day power delivery information is not available, modeling a time-dependent 
resource as a generating unit with constant capability and an appropriate forced outage 
rate may yield a reasonable approximation. The benefit of modeling the resource as a 
generating unit is that many utility planning models [such as WASP] have probabilistic 
algorithms for addressing generating unit unavailability attributable to random 
equipment failures. This feature could be used to reflect the uncertainty associated with 
renewable power delivery. In some models, [like WASP] unit unavailability is specified by 
a forced outage rate - the percentage of time that a unit is expected to be unavailable. 
Other models (notably those of a chronological nature) allow a user to model a unit's 
availability by specifying probability distributions for the time between outages and the 
time it may take to restore the unit to service. In renewable resource modeling, any of 
these availability features could be used to represent the renewable generation that 
would be curtailed because of equipment failure (usually a minor factor) or lack of wind 
or sunshine (the major factor that limits wind and solar resource generation).12
65. For the EMP power expansion study, renewable energy options are represented with the 
operational characteristics listed in Table 13. 
Table 13: Candidate Renewables – Operational Characteristics 
 Source: Consultant, H.-W. Boehnke ASR Report, ADB TA-8356 Myanmar 2014
66. When simulating system operation for a configuration of unit additions that includes a 50 MW 
solar PV candidate with a forced outage rate of 81.3%, the WASP IV model reflects that the PV candidate 
operates only 18.7% of the time. For the remainder of time, when the solar PV unit is not generating, 
the full system load must be satisfied by other units or result in increased cost of unserved energy and a 
higher loss of load probability. 
67. Capital cost assumptions for candidate renewables are listed in Table 14. The estimated cost of 
1.8 US$/W for solar PV in Myanmar is on advice of the WBG. As the cost of solar PV continues to decline 
due to learning curve and mass production effects, with reference to the Black & Veatch generation

VII. POWER EXPANSION PLANNING PROCESS 
Q. PRELIMINARY SCREENING OF GENERATION OPTIONS
68. A preliminary screening exercise was performed to chart the economic competitiveness of 
expansion candidates as a function of their technology utilization. This approach is used to develop 
initial insights into the relative competitiveness of generation options over a range of technical and cost 
assumptions before carrying out the expansion planning study. 
69. The Screening Curve diagram in Figure 5 shows the levelized generation cost expressed in 
US$/kW-yr calculated at different capacity factors for all candidates using a discount rate of 10% and 
technical and cost parameters for described above. As an initial indication, the diagram points to hydro 
candidates (with average capacity factor of 42%) being most competitive, while solar appears more 
economic than wind. In comparing the dispatchable thermal power plants, Gas Turbine has an 
advantage when dispatched to operate at a low capacity factor, GTCC performs well within the capacity 
factor range of 10% to 35%, and COAL has an advantage over other thermal candidates for base load 
generation.

R. BENCHMARKING MODEL SIMULATION VS SYSTEM OPERATIONS 
72. After assembling the WASP IV database for the EMP power expansion study and running the 
model, a validity check was performed to compare the generation mix reported by the WASP simulation 
against actual system operations in 2013. WASP IV model simulated results are presented in Table 15 
and actual system operation statistics received from MOEP are presented in Table 16. 
Table 15: WASP IV Simulated Results (MWh) Table 16: Actual System Operations (MWh) 
 Source: Consultant Source: MOEP Operations Statistics
73. While recognizing that the actual system operation statistics include an amount of hydro 
generated electricity for exports and the WASP simulation focuses exclusively on electricity generation 
for Myanmar, there is a tight correlation between the seasonal generation mix for the simulated results 
and actual values. 
74. In the WASP simulation for 2013, hydropower is dispatched with an average capacity factor of 
44%, while coal plants averaged 85%, existing GTCC 81% and Gas Turbines 38%. In 2013, no additional 
generation was required from new GTCC power plants. VIII. LEAST COST POWER SYSTEM EXPANSION PLAN

78. In the least cost expansion plan, all 6,328 MW of candidate hydropower projects is added over the period of study. 
79. 2,500 MW of new coal-fired generation is added beginning with the first 500 MW unit in 2023. 
80. In addition to the 1,700 MW of committed additions of new gas-fired generation through 2016, an additional 100 MW 
of Gas Turbines is brought online in the final year of the study. 
81. Concerning renewables, no wind generators were selected in the least cost plan. However, after the second scheduled 
cost reduction takes effect in 2025, solar power becomes quite competitive and 2,300 MW is added to the system from 2025 
to 2030. 0

86. With the amount of candidate hydro power projects limited to just over 6,300 MW, the share of 
hydro in the system capacity mix drops from 72% in 2013 to 55% in 2030. In line with the reducing 
share of hydro capacity, hydro generation is reduced from 73% in 2013 to 56% in 2030. 
87. Gas-fired generation rises from 26% of total in 2013 to a high of 39% in 2018, then drops to just 
8% of total electricity generation in 2030. 
88. Although there is about an equal share of installed capacity for solar (14%), gas- (15%), and coalfired (16%) power plants in 2030, their respective shares of total generation are far from equal with coal 
at 29%, gas 8%, and solar 6%. 
T. FUEL REQUIREMENT AND EXPENDITURE 
89. To meet increased demand for electricity over the period 2013 – 2030, consumption of coal, and 
natural gas in the power sector is expected to increase as elaborated in Table 22. Also noted is the 
associated fuel expenditures in current year (non-discounted) values.

U. POWER DEVELOPMENT COST
92. To implement the EMP Reference Case Power Expansion Plan through 2030, the 2013 present 
worth of capital cost investment is approximately 10.5 billion US$ and O&M cost - including fuel cost –
approximately 6.3 billion US$. Annual and cumulative discounted costs for the least cost plan are 
provided in Table 24.

 Source: Consultant Analysis
V. EFFECTS OF DISCOUNT RATE ON LEAST COST PLAN
93. Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the robustness of the identified least cost power 
expansion plan and assess the impact on the plan to changes in a number of key factors, including 
discount rate, potential schedule delays in commissioning of new hydropower plants, and 
environmental considerations. 
94. To analyze the effects of discount rate on the least cost plan, planning studies were carried for 
discount rates of 8% and 5%. The sequences of plant additions for these cases are given in Figures 10 
and 11.  Source: Consultant Analysis
Figure 10: Sensitivity Analysis #1 – Discount Rate of 8% 
95. Reducing the discount rate from 10% to 8% produces an expected result of accelerating the 
commission of capital intensive projects. All candidate hydropower plants are commissioned on their 
first year of availability and the timing of the first new coal unit moves forward from 2023 to 2020. The 
number and timing of candidate additions for gas, wind, and solar remains unchanged. 
96. With a discount rate of 5%, the least cost plan once again commissions all candidate 
hydropower plants on their first year of availability. The timing of the first coal unit advances to 2019 
and an extra unit is introduced bring the total amount of capacity added for coal to 3,000 MW. For the 
lower capital intensive candidates (e.g., solar and gas), the timing of new unit additions is delayed and 
number reduced.

W. EFFECTS OF HPP SCHEDULE DELAY ON LEAST COST PLAN
97. To analyze the effect of delays in hydropower plant commissioning on the least cost plan and 
associated fuel requirements, the least cost plan was re-optimized after adjusting the schedule of 
candidate hydropower project additions to delay the first year of availability for each candidate by two 
years. This case assumes that no new hydro project can be added before 2017. The resulting sequences 
of plant additions is displayed in Figure 12 and associated fuel requirements listed in Table 25. HPP 
schedule delays result in increased levels of gas consumption through 2019 followed by construction of 
six 500 MW coal power plants with the first commissioned in 2020.

 Source: Consultant Analysis and Newjec NEMP 2014X. EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS ON LEAST COST PLAN
98. While this study focused on development of an economically optimal generation expansion 
strategy that satisfies specified reliability constraints, it is important to value both environmental 
protection and economic considerations in the development of an optimum solution. 
99. One method of assigning a value to environmental protection, is through use of a carbon pricing 
mechanism. WBG’s Carbon Pricing Watch 2015 brief notes the following recent carbon pricing 
developments: Beijing and Kazakhstan use a fee of 8 US$/tCO2, Korea 9 US$/tCO2, and France 
15 US$/tCO2. 
100. To begin analyzing the effect of environmental considerations on the least cost plan, the 
expansion strategy was re-optimized using carbon pricing rates of 10 US$/tCO2 and 15 US$/ tCO2. The 
resulting sequences of plant additions are displayed in Figures 13 and 14. 
 Source: Consultant Analysis
Figure 13: Sensitivity Analysis #4 – Carbon Price of 10 US$ per tonne CO2
101. As illustrated in Figure 13, a carbon price of 10 US$/tCO2 has little effect on the least cost 
expansion strategy. The schedule for commissioning of candidate hydropower plants is accelerated so 
that all HPPs are selected on their first year of availability. However, the number and timing of new unit 
additions remains unchanged for all other expansion candidates. 102. In contrast, Figure 14 illustrates that a carbon price of 15 US$/tCO2 has a profound effect on the 
least cost expansion strategy. The schedule of new coal-fired units is delayed and number of units is 
reduced. As a substitute for coal, an additional 600 MW of gas-fired capacity is brought online, along 
with a total of 1500 MW of solar and 200 MW of wind.

Y. EFFECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY ON LEAST COST PLAN
103. Upon reviewing the draft report of this power expansion study, responsible government 
agencies commented on the desire for increased diversification of energy sources in the national power 
expansion plan. 
104. MOEP commented “it is necessary to develop diverse generation mix,” and NEMC noted “We 
suggest modification should be made to the proposed expansion plan because the dependency on the 
hydroelectricity is relatively high during the mid-term.”
105. NEMC provided further guidance noting “Although the expansion plan is based on least cost 
option, it still needs to encourage the renewable power generation. According to the discussion 
between MOEP and interested parties, it is also needed to consider the possible establishment of solar 
farms in the near future,” and “the timing of introducing coal power plant in the ADICA's power 
expansion plan should be reconsidered.”
106. In response to the above comments, ADICA conducted additional sensitivity analyses to 
demonstrate how the WASP model can be used to evaluate the effect of potential government policies 
related to renewable energy integration and diversification of energy sources on the least cost 
expansion plan. The following three sensitivity cases were analyzed: 
(i) Solar RPS: Establish a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) setting a goal for 100 MW of new 
solar power integration each year from 2019 to 2022, 200 MW new solar added annually from 2023 to 2028. No RPS is needed in the last two years of the study when comparative 
economics of generation options results in higher levels of solar adoption. 
(ii) Coal 2020: Consider potential government decision to advance timing of introducing new 
coal plants in the least cost plan by three years with first plant added in 2020. 
(iii) Solar RPS + Coal 2020: Implement the Solar RPS and Coal 2020 policies in combination. 
107. As illustrated in Figure 15, the impact of a Solar RPS policy as defined in 106.i is to delay the 
construction of the new coal-fired plants, and accelerate the construction of one hydro plant.

111. To identify an expansion strategy that best meets national goals for a sustainable, reliable, and 
competitive electricity supply, we recommend evaluating alternative expansion strategies with respect 
to key performance indicators, like the following: 
a) Sustainability of an expansion strategy assessed in terms of air pollutant emissions over the 
study period and amount of renewable energy in the national capacity mix in 2030. 
b) Reliability assessed in terms of system LOLP and security of energy supply in 2030. 
c) Competitiveness of an expansion strategy assessed in terms of total discounted system cost 
over the study period, total revenue obtained from the placement of a value on CO2 
emissions, and the associated foreign fuel bill. 
112. Summary results for the least cost plan displayed in Table 27 can be used in comparing this plan 
with alternative expansion strategies developed under a consistent set of assumptions.

113. Linking the comparison of alternative expansion strategies to key performance metrics 
highlights the costs and benefits of each option and provides useful information for decision making on 
power system expansion.

k $IX. TRANSMISSION DEVELOPMENT 
115. It is difficult to assess the corresponding transmission development plans to match the 
generation expansion plans for the medium growth case without estimates of individual substation load 
growth to perform detailed load flows of the power system. The EMP study provided regional demand 
estimates that could have been used to estimate substation loads but the study but did not perform the 
necessary load flows to establish transmission requirements. The EMP regional forecasts however 
showed that there would significantly higher growth outside Yangon which more closely matched the 
high load demand case. 
116. For the forecast high case study, Newjec provided substation load estimates based on pro-rata 
growth rates assuming all regions would develop at the same rate. This indicated the total matching 
transmission investment would be $2.37b to 2020 and an additional $3.38 by 2030 for a total 
investment of $5.75b. Newjec included provision for a second 500kV line to be built in parallel with the 
500kV line that is currently committed for completion by 2020. Newjec also considered other 
transmission arrangements for the high demand case necessary to evacuate large amounts of hydro 
power from northern areas of Myanmar to the southern load centres using an HVDC link. However, this 
would increase the total investment by a further $2.2b. Their analysis indicates that if it was possible to 
develop hydro resources faster than appears feasible at present, it would be necessary to look at 
alternative ways of staging the investments of the 500kV and HVDC lines to effect the north south 
power evacuation requirements to meet the medium growth case. 
117. Separately the consultants Fichtner14 prepared a transmission investment plan using pro-rata 
load growth estimates corresponding to the medium demand forecast. Their investment requirements 
to 2025, with provision for the ongoing 500kV line construction included, is summarized below and 
corresponds closely to the first stage of the Newjec estimates for transmission investments to 2020. 
Without more detailed analysis this combined investment program should therefore be considered a 
proxy for the investment needs for the medium forecast.

Summary of Transmission Projects Identified By Fichtner/MOEP
Priority Investments for 2017-2025118. Notably neither Newjec nor Fichtner considered the issues that can be expected to arise as a 
result of developing hydro projects on a shared basis with Yunnan and/or Thailand. As noted in Annex A, 
one solution is to operate a hybrid transmission interconnection arrangement using 500kV and HVDC 
systems connected in parallel with each other. This mode of operation will provide a continuous 
interconnection between all three parties that should increase flexibility and security of supplies to both 
systems. The proposed interconnection arrangement is adapted from one of the scenarios proposed in 
the 2014 MOEP-NEMP. It indicates that it may be feasible to build the HVDC line, in advance of the 
second 500kV line, to meet the base load. The proposal should be studied further when the NEMP 
masterplan is revised. 
X. OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
119. This power planning study had as objective to apply the WASP IV model in identifying an 
economically optimum generation expansion plan under the EMP's medium growth case, and was 
successful in developing the reported least cost power expansion plan. 
120. It is important to keep in mind that the role of the energy planner is not do develop “the plan” 
to be implemented. Rather, energy planning involves analysis of the energy system with the intent of 
providing decision makers information that will enable them to make informed judgments on strategies 
needed to meet current and future energy objectives. 
121. This study provides useful information for decision making on energy development in Myanmar, 
including but not limited to the following observations: 
a) The national power expansion plan designed to meet the EMP medium growth forecast of 9.6% 
CAGR on a least-cost basis shows hydroelectric and gas-fired generation playing a dominant role 
in meeting the countries electrical needs through 2021 – at which time coal, then renewables 
become viable candidates. 
b) Under the least cost expansion plan, natural gas demand for electricity generation is not 
expected to exceed the NEMP-reported limit of domestic gas supply allocation for the power 
sector through 2030. Still, sufficient natural gas supply for power production is essential for 
reliable supply of electricity – particularly in the case of delays in HPP construction. 
c) Based on the assumed technical and cost parameters for the EMP national power expansion 
plan, which are consistent with the NEMP, hydro power generation is the most economic supply 
option followed by coal. All thirty-eight hydropower candidates (totaling 6,328 MW), and 2,500 
MW of coal-fired capacity are selected for construction in the least cost expansion plan. 
Reducing the discount rate below the value of 10% assumed in this study results in capital 
intensive coal and hydro candidates becoming even more competitive as compared with gas and 
solar. d) In evaluating the potential role of coal-fired power plants in the least cost expansion plan, this 
study determined that, under the EMP medium growth forecast and assumptions listed in this 
report, new coal-fired generation is not economically justifiable before 2023. However, 
sensitivity analyses highlight that new coal could be required earlier in response to delayed 
commissioning of new hydro power plants or a reduction in the forecasted supply of natural gas 
available for electricity generation. 
e) Sensitivity analysis related to hydro power plant commissioning points to a 2-year delay in the 
schedule of HPP additions resulting in increased levels of gas consumption through 2019 
followed by construction of six 500 MW coal power plants with the first commissioned in 2020. 
f) This study investigated the viability of large-scale renewable energy projects by evaluating wind 
and solar energy candidate projects in the context of the least cost generation expansion plan 
and identifies substantial potential for solar PV. Contributing factors include: (i) declining price 
of PV, (ii) renewable potential for solar being high in locations close to the grid and major load 
centres, (iii) Myanmar’s largely hydro based system with significant spinning reserve capability, 
and (iv) the strong seasonal variations of solar and hydro energy potential in the country 
complement each other over the year. 
g) While this study focuses on development of an economically optimal (“least cost”) generation 
expansion plan that satisfies specified constraints on system reliability, it is important to value 
both environmental protection and economic considerations in development of an optimum 
strategy for the country. One method of assigning a value to environmental protection is 
through use of a carbon pricing mechanism. Results of sensitivity analyses point to a price of 
15 US$/tCO2 having a profound effect on the least cost expansion strategy – reducing the 
number of new coal-fired units, increasing gas-fired capacity by 600 MW over the least cost 
plan, and adding a total of 1,500 MW of solar and 200 MW of wind energy through 2030. 
h) Sensitivity analyses further demonstrate that government policies related to renewable energy 
integration and diversification of energy sources can have a profound impact on the least cost 
power expansion plan and substantially reduce the reliance on hydroelectricity. 
122. In the conduct of this study, a number of enhancements were made to the national WASP IV 
database and power system planning process. To maximize the benefits from this effort, we 
recommend that WASP IV training be provided to MOEP and NEMC staff through ongoing capacity 
building initiatives organized with the ADB and JICA. 
123. As planning is a process, the power system expansion plan should be revised annually by MOEP 
according to updated information and assumptions related to energy demand, fuel prices and 
availability, government policies, etc. Suggested priority issues warranting further consideration in the 
next update of the national power expansion plan, include: i) Hydropower Development: Due to limited availability of information on candidate hydro plants, the 
EMP expansion planning study used an average cost of new hydro developed by Newjec and applied 
aggregated characteristics of existing HPPs to develop initial estimates of seasonal operations for 
new hydro candidates. The ADB consultants agree with earlier comments by the WBG, that “a 
proper hydropower development study is needed to … optimize hydropower development.” We 
note that a Norwegian effort over the next 18 months intends to upgrade MOEPs hydro data base 
and recommend that this effort also be deployed to capture information tailored to represent hydro 
capital cost and operational data for the WASP database. In parallel with the data collection effort, 
we recommend that MOEP consider complementing the current WASP-based planning with use of 
additional models that are able to capture the stochastic representation of hydropower that is 
lacking in WASP. For example, WASP is regularly run together with the VALORAGUA model (and 
others) for systems with a substantial amount of hydro. 
j) Natural Gas Price for the Power Sector: The EMP expansion planning study assumed $11.2 per 
mmBTU as the price of natural gas to the power sector, which is the MOE-proposed gas price to 
MOEP and is consistent with the value used in the JICA-supported MOEP's NEMP. We note that 
WBG is carrying out a gas price study and suggest that results of this study will enhance 
understanding on appropriate economic value of gas in the country and should be reflected in 
future updates of the national power expansion plan. 
k) Demand Forecast and System Load Characteristics: The current study defined seasonal load 
characteristics based on actual hourly loads in 2014 and uses the medium growth forecast of peak 
load and generation requirements developed in the EMP study. It is advised for MOEP to acquire 
and apply a tool such as the IAEA’s Model for Analysis of Energy Demand (MAED) for forecasting 
electricity demand. MAED provides a systematic framework for mapping trends and anticipating 
change in energy needs corresponding to alternative scenarios for socioeconomic development and 
producing an associated hourly load forecast. 
l) Integrated Generation and Transmission System Planning: Modeling the generation and 
transmission system in an integrated manner is more important in hydro-dominated power system 
because of significant investment cost of transmission connections between load centers and 
relatively remote hydropower plants. In addition, properly managed, hydro reservoir storage can 
deliver benefits in moderating seasonal variations in electricity supply due to changing water inflows 
and balancing hourly variability in generation from future renewable energy sources. It is 
recommended that MOEP should acquire suitable planning tools and build institutional capacity for 
developing an integrated generation and transmission plan for the country. Analyses to support the 
integrated plan should: (i) address short term system operation and stability issues at a higher level 
of detailed (e.g., hourly simulation) than is computationally possible with current long-term planning 
models, (ii) evaluate the value of hydro storage capacity in prioritizing the hydro development 
program, and (iii) identify transmission lines which are highest priority to support generation 
expansion and regional integration. Annex A 
Transmission Interconnection Strategy for Hydro Exports to GMS Countries Transmission Interconnection Strategy for Hydro Exports to GMS Countries 
Myanmar has considerable hydroelectric resources, some of which the Gov’t wishes to develop to 
export power to its neighbours, notably China and Thailand. Some larger potential hydro sites located 
close to the borders with both countries have been identified as potential resources that could be 
developed on a shared basis. In particular, there are a group of hydro stations in northern Kachin state 
with an aggregate potential of 8835MW near the border with Yunnan, along with the proposed 
7000MW Ta Sang15 scheme in Shan State near the border with Thailand. 
For some of the border projects, the Gov’t envisages that a joint development agreement could be 
arranged so that up to 50% of the hydro power output could be evacuated to the major load centres in 
Yangon and Mandalay with the other 50% exported under a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). Recently 
there has also been a suggestion that China may have excess hydro power in the short term and could 
be interested in exporting surplus power to Myanmar. 
Since there are currently no plans to synchronise the three adjacent power systems of Yunnan, Thailand 
and Myanmar, it has been suggested that the busbars of the border hydro generating units should be 
separately synchronised the respective power systems in the border countries. This mode of operation 
will be difficult to operate safely and could cause system operational difficulties. Faults that occur on 
one or other of the transmission systems and will reduce the security and reliability of service from the 
hydro stations. 
This paper therefore proposes that a feasible solution would be to operate a hybrid transmission 
interconnection arrangement using 500kV and HVDC systems connected in parallel with each other. 
This mode of operation will provide a continuous interconnection between all three parties that should 
increase flexibility and security of supplies to both systems. The proposed interconnection arrangement 
is adapted from one of the scenarios proposed in the 2014 MOEP-NEMP and will also provide the lowest 
cost means of supplying bulk power from the northern states to the southern load centres of Myanmar. 
Myanmar National Electricity Master Plan MOEP-NEMP (JICA-NewJec) 
The MOEP-NEMP completed in December 2014 proposes various interconnection arrangements for 
evacuating hydro power from the north to the south of Myanmar assuming these projects would be 
developed to meet a high demand growth scenario. Two of the MOEP-NEMP proposed Scenarios (1/2) 
as shown below suggest the concept of building parallel 500kV and HVDC circuits are best suited to 
evaluate large amounts of hydro at least cost to Yangon. However, the NEMP does not indicate how the 
three power systems could be interconnected to maintain security and reliability of the respective 
networks. Nor does the plan suggest the order in which the transmission projects would be developed if 
demand grew more slowly – in accordance with a medium demand scenario. 
Notably many of the proposed larger hydros in the MOEP-NEMP generation expansion plan (Yenan1200MW, Kaungglanphu-2700MW, Pisa-2000MW, Wutsok-1880MW, Lawngdin plus three others1055MW) are grouped together in the border area of the Kachin state. Some of these plants are

Dam included in the WASP generation expansion scenarios based on the assumption that 50% of hydro 
output will be exported to China and 50% evacuated to Myanmar. 
MOEP-NEMP Transmission proposals for Three Scenarios of Generation Expansion 
Notably the transmission arrangements shown above indicate the Myanmar system will be synchronised 
with China although there are no such plans under consideration. An alternative proposal would be to 
synchronise all of northern hydro plants with China, and separate the two respective Mynamar and 
Chinese 500kV systems at the future Myitsone hydro (6000MW) project substation. To enable Myanmar 
to continuously evacuate its 50% share of hydro power from the future Kachin plants, as well as any 
surplus power from China, it would therefore be desirable to advance the building of the proposed 
HVDC line to Yangon (i.e. build it ahead of the proposed second 500kV line programmed in Scenario 
1/2and 3). However, to simplify operations the 500kV and HVDC terminal should be at the Myitsone 
500kV busbars (instead of Chibwe as shown above). At a future date when/if the huge 6000MW 
Myitsone hydro station is built it may be appropriate to consider installing an HVDC b/b facility 
interconnecting the station 500kV busbars. 
Since the proposed bipolar HVDC line will be about 1100km16 long, it would be significantly cheaper to 
build than an equivalent 500kV d/c line and would offer the advantage of providing increasing stability 
 
16 When comparing HVAC and HVDC the cost crossover where HVDC is much cheaper is about 400-700km 
depending on the volume of power transmitted: http://electrical-engineering-portal.com/analysing-the-costs-ofhigh-voltage-direct-current-hvdc-transmission and security of supplies at the Yangon and Myitsone 500kV busbars. Moreover, the HVDC line can be 
designed so its capacity can be upgraded in (say) 1500MW stages (e.g. by changing from a monopolar to 
bipolar configuration, and/or by incrementally increasing terminal capacity and/or operating voltages 
from (say)±400kV to ±800kV). Because an HVDC line would operate in parallel to the underlying 
500/230kV HVAC systems, it could be developed for private sector financing and/or operation on the 
basis a long term BOT contract with revenues based on agreed availability charges. 
Proposals for Myanmar-GMS Interconnections 
As a member of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Mynamar needs to consider ways in which its 
transmission export projects are compatible with GMS interconnection planning. As shown below a 
recent GMS Road Map includes a plan (a) to extend 500kV lines from Tha Wang S/S (substation) in 
Thailand to Meng Yang S/S and Simao S/S in Yunnan China- the latter will presumably be connected to 
the large HVDC terminal at the Chuxiong converter station17; and (b) to build a new 500KV line from Mae 
Moh S/S to Ta Sang S/S in Shan State. This arrangement however does not address or explain how the 
three currently asynchronous power systems will be interconnected – in fact it implies that Thailand, 
Myanmar and Yunnan will all be synchronised with each other18! 
 
17 The Yunnan-Guangdong project has a rated voltage of an ±800-kV dc, a capacity of 5,000 MW and a transmission 
distance of 1,418 km (881 miles). The main parts of the system are the Chuxiong converter station, the Suidong 
converter station, the dc transmission lines and electrodes at both ends 
18 This is probably the most important technical issue that needs resolution in the next five years. It is generally 
accepted that HVAC power systems must be synchronised to safely and optimally manage generation and power 
flows under various operational conditions.Masterplan for GMS EHV Grid Integration (June 2013) Potential for HVDC Interconnections within GMS 
Within the South East Asian subcontinent, most of the GMS cross border transmission proposals 
propose the use 500kV interconnections. While HVDC links are also proposed in a few situations this is 
largely because it is not practical to have long HVAC submarine cables (e.g. as required between 
Malaysia to Sumatera and Java-Sumatera). However, HVDC is increasingly being recognised as a suitable 
technology for interconnecting regional grids particularly where these are relatively small with long 
distances between main generation and load centres. 
HDVC is indeed being used in both within China and India to link their various states together and to 
transfer large amounts of power over long distances. In this respect HVDC is much easier to control than 
HVAC and can link systems together without having to be concerned about local synchronisation issues. 
Unlike HVAC, HVDC links can be turned on/off, as power flows transferred up or down in response to 
system control instruction or as required by commercial load transfer requirements. There is clearly 
opportunity for ASEAN countries to make the technological leap beyond 500kV HVAC lines and consider 
the possibility using HVDC links for easily controllable power exchange within the GMS regions19
. 
Notably even in the EU, where the UCTE operates a relatively tight 400kV networks, grid integration 
with the remoter EU systems (e.g. Scandinavian countries, UK, Eastern Europe) is being enhanced by a 
number of HVDC links. Moreover, there is considerable discussion within the EU about the need for a 
future HVDC grid overlay to facilitate power exchange between regions20: Part of this revived interest 
in HVDC is because the HVDC technology is increasingly being employed to integrate large intermittent 
offshore wind farm production into onshore HVAC grids. As a consequence, the limitations the older 
variety of HVDC (as used in the NZ HVDC link for the last 50 years) are being addressed using the 
versatility of modern electronic control systems21
. 
 
19 HVDC can be extended into neighbouring countries in much the same way as proposed for the WB funded CASA 
1000 project linking Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan: http://www.casa-1000.org/

energysourceCharacteristics of HVDC Systems 
For point-to-point transmission of bulk power over 500 km or more, HVDC transmission links can 
normally be built at a lower overall cost than conventional HVAC lines. Although HVDC transmission 
lines can be constructed at about 50% of the cost of an equivalent HVAC line, the cost of the necessary 
HVDC/HVAC converter stations are about $120/kW, compared with $20/kW for a conventional 
HVAC/HVAC substation. 
Typical HVDC Interconnection Arrangements
An HVDC interconnection for interconnecting asynchronous systems is sometimes effected with an 
HVDC back-to-back (b/b) facility, thereby enabling adjacent power systems to maintain their own 
system frequencies independently of the other. HVDC effectively enables two power systems to be 
interconnected without having to re-synchronize after every forced or planned disconnection. However, 
in considering an HVDC b/b facility, it is prudent to also consider building a long HVDC transmission 
interconnection instead to achieve the same objective at much lower cost. HVDC is also used in many 
countries, in parallel with HVAC systems, to improve system stability at both ends of the HVDC line as 
well as moving power more economically over long distances. In effect, HVDC can be designed to act as 
a very fast FACTS operating device designed to inject power into the HVAC system and counteract 
inherent instability problems. 
Although HVDC technology has many years of operational experience,22 new control systems have been 
developed recently which reduce cost and improve flexibility and performance. This is based on modern, 
newly developed voltage source converters (VSC23) with series-connected insulated gate bi-polar 
transistor (IGBT) valves controlled with pulse width modulation (PWM) that have already reached levels 
of 1,200 MW and ±500 kV. Notably, HVDC can also be built in stages to increase loading, as required. 
This can be done by first building the line for monopole operation, then later uprating to bipole 
operation – and, if necessary, uprating again using a higher operating voltage. Provided that the line is 
designed for its ultimate operating configuration (at little extra cost), the cost lies primarily in uprating 
the HVDC/HVAC terminals at each end of the lines. 
 
22
 HVDC was originally developed to supply large volumes of power over long distances. The first large-scale commercial 
project was installed in 1965 in New Zealand where a 600 MW HVDC line was built to carry power from the South Island 600 km 
to the North Island. This has operated very reliably for over 45 years and was recently upgraded to 1,400 MW. Over 200 HVDC 
systems have been built over the years. The longest HVDC link in the world is currently the 2,071 km ±800 kV, 6,400 MW link 
connecting Xiangjiaba Dam to Shanghai in the People's Republic of China.

It is also important to note that HVDC lines have a much smaller environmental footprint than HVAC 
which is especially important for crossing mountainous forested areas as typically exist in Myanmar. The 
picture below (left) compares the ROW requirements for a typical 500kV triple and double circuity 
500kV line with the equivalent capacity HVDC line (left-bottom). The pictures below (right) show the 
equivalent ROW requirements for two bipole lines (right-tope) and a monopole line with earth return 
(right-bottom). HVDC versus HVAC Costs 
It would be difficult to compare the cost of developing the HVAC and HVDC solutions without taking into 
account the stages of development of the hydro resources, the strategy for synchronisation between 
countries and the respective quantities of power planned to be exported over time to Myanmar, China 
and Thailand. It can be generally stated that for the distance involved (1100km) the unit costs associated 
with the transfer of about 2400MW of through an HVDC bipole system would be about 0.52 $/MW.km 
compared with an HVAC solution of about 0.86 $/MW.km24. 
The table below shows a comparison of the total investment cost might be expected to change for the 
transfer of up to 6000MW over distances of 320, 640and 1290km.
Proposed Interconnection Arrangement for Myanmar-Yunnan-Thailand 
The proposed adaption of the MOEP-NEMP 500kV-HVDC arrangement is shown geographically over 
page and in the schematic diagram below. 500kV lines are shown in red, HVDC lines in orange. The 
geographic picture has utilized Google Earth design features to select possible routes along valleys or 
near existing roads. In the schematic drawing details of the Thailand and Yunnan substations 
connections, and cross border lines are not shown but could be inserted in the diagram when more 
information is available. The picture however shows the two areas of Myanmar that could be operated 
in synchronism with China and Thailand.

1. The draft version of the Myanmar Energy Master Plan (EMP) report was submitted to ADB on 19 
November 2014. It was subsequently issued by ADB to the Ministry of Energy on 19 December 2014. 
2. On 26 March 2015, ADB provided the Consultant with comments from the concerned Myanmar 
ministries on the Draft EMP report. 
3. It should be noted that the original concept was for IES to subsequently undertake consultations with 
each of the concerned ministries on the Draft EMP report findings and their feedback. However, 
circumstances did not allow this to occur. As such, the Final report has sought to address the comments 
raised by the concerned ministries as best as possible, but in the absence of any meaningful consultation with 
the concerned ministries. This means that in some cases we were not able to confirm or clarify the intent of 
some questions and also confirm / verify our understanding of additional data that was provided to IES by the 
concerned ministries as part of their feedback. 
4. We have therefore taken a “best endeavours” approach to addressing the stakeholder comments but 
can’t guarantee that we have adequately resolved all issues to the same level as would have occurred had IES 
been able to engage in consultations following the issuance of the draft report.

For Chapter (D) Demand Forecast: Industry Sector:
In paragraph of 6, although it is indicated that the earning 
form the export of natural gas in year 2012 is about 3.6 
billion dollar but the cumulative contribution of Oil & Gas, 
Electricity and water in the total GDP is only 1.2%. So, it is 
needed to be consistent.
The 1.2% is based on constant price evaluation according to 
ADB statistics. ADB statistics give the GDP of Electricity, 
Gas and Water as 611 billion kyats in 2012 (current value) at 
an exchange rate of 660 kyats per USD$. This does not 
equate to $3.6 billion, rather it equates to ~$1 billion. It 
appears that the ADB include oil in the mining sector GDP 
(this will be checked with ADB). The figure of $3.6 billion 
includes a contribution from the mining sector; therefore the 
reference to oil in clause 6 is misplaced and will be revised.
The basic calculation, concept and methodology used for 
Industry Sector FEC forecast should be indicated.
The calculations, concept and methodology were planned to 
be explained as part of consultation or training process (or 
directly with Ministry of Industry representatives if preferred). 
The energy demand forecasts for the Industry Sector are 
amongst the most difficult given the wide range of activities 
involved.
In figure I.8: although the heading is “Energy-Intensive 
Industry Sector FEC Forecast” but the figure shows just 
only actual consumption data for the period of 2005 to 
2013.
The heading has been corrected.
How figure I.7, I.9, I.10 and I.13 are related to 
each other and it should be explained. Additionally, it
should also be explained how figure I.13 is created 
including its details calculation.
The details will be explained during upcoming training / 
appreciation workshop (or directly with Ministry of Industry 
representatives if preferred).
In the energy planning, only the manufacturing industry is 
taken into account under energy intensive industry category 
while the others, such as mining & quarrying, construction 
and power & gas sectors are eliminated due to the 
Mining and quarrying activities of significant scale were 
assumed to use captive power sources; while this is 
important for the energy balance it does not affect 
electricity expansion planning. It was mentioned that also developing and it is also needed to consider their 
influence on the energy consumption of industry sector.
intensive but the production of construction materials such 
as bricks, glass and cement require significant amounts of 
energy. The power and gas sector either provides its own 
captive power sources, e.g. supplying platforms/wells, or 
involves secondary transformation; the former is treated as 
captive power whereas the latter has been modelled and 
own-use has been included
Sources of reference are important for Table II-3. The figures in Table II-3 were computed from the survey 
data provided by Myanmar industry. The figures are 
average figures for each of the industries mentioned. 
These points will be clarified with a note below the table. 
It is indicated, energy efficiency of some selected Industries 
is higher than IEA efficiency benchmark but in the 
paragraph 10, it is also mentioned that the efficiency of the 
industry sector has been increasing rapidly in recent years.
Paragraph 10 refers to ‘energy intensity’, not energy 
efficiency. An increase in energy intensity, as shown in 
Figure I-13, is to be expected when an industrial sector 
grows; from an energy efficiency perspective it is not a 
positive development.
GDP forecast in the energy master plan should be in line 
with the forecast made by Ministry of National Planning and 
Economic Development.
The GDP forecast is in line with the MNPED forecast. 
Change to the population base to match with Census 2014 
will affect the figures equally and the comparison will 
remain valid. 
For Chapter C: Primary Reserves and Technology Options
Environmental conservation law is enacted on 8 August 
2014 and the section 52, 53 and 54 of environmental 
conservation law indicates that it is needed to conduct the 
pre environmental impact assessment for the proposed 
projects. Currently, Environmental Conservation 
Department of Ministry of Environmental Conservation and 
Forestry is undertaking to review the hydropower projects 
proposals from the environmental point of view and they are 
also reviewing the environmental impact assessment 
reports submitted by contractors.
Therefore, the following sentence from the paragraph 231 
should be deleted “As mentioned above, the current 
environmental legislation does not require the 
commissioning of EIAs and thus the environmental and 
social standards and practices employed by the investors 
themselves are extremely relevant in the host country.”
Noted and deleted from the report.
- For Chapter B: Historical Energy Balance:
- The same graph is used in Figure VI-2 and Figure VI-3 and 
it should be corrected.
- Under those graphs, it should be denoted “MOECAF” as a 
source of information not “MOF”
- Abbreviation of MOECAF should be included
Noted and corrections have been made in Chapter B.
- For Chapter E: Vol.1: Consolidated Demand Forecast:
- In figure III-6, the physical unit should be changed to “000’ 
tons”.
Agree and adjustments made.6. The Consultant’s responses to the feedback and comments from the Ministry of Mining are set out in 
Table II-2.

Comment Response
- For Chapter B: Historical Energy Balance:
- Reserve Potential shown in Table II-4 includes 
Proven of Positive Ore Reserve (P1), Probable Ore 
Reserve (P2), Possible Ore Reserve (P3), and 
Potential Ore Reserve (P4). Among them, P3 and 
P4 are only potential reserve and the accuracy of 
coal reserve amount from P3 and P4 class coal 
mines is low.
In the case of proven reserves, all the coal reserve 
cannot be extracted due to technical and other 
constraints such as the thickness, dip angle, 
overburden, groundwater.
This is noted, and some clarifying text added to the Energy 
Balance chapter.
- Coal reserve identified in Table II -4 is not the 
remaining amount. Some coal mines, such as Maw 
Taung, San Laung, Namma and Kalaywa Coal 
mines cannot bear the same amount because those 
coal mines have been operating since many years 
ago. And most of the large coal deposits have 
already been handed over to private sector.
- Figure II-5 indicates the potential large coal deposits 
in Myanmar but it will be difficult for coal production 
due to steep coal bed dripping.
- Efficiency of conventional coal fired power plant is 
very low and high technology coal fired power plants 
have high efficiency but they need exported high 
class coal. On the other hand, environmental and 
social acceptance on coal fired power plants is very 
low in Myanmar. Therefore, high expectation should 
not be made to establish coal fired power plant.
As above, noted. Figure II-5 has been replaced by a more 
detailed overview of the locations of Myanmar’s coal resources. 
- For Chapter C: Primary Reserves and Technology 
Options:
- In Table III-1, coal production forecast for 2015-2016 
is 2316000 ton and it is about 4 times higher than 
2013-2014 production. Increasing the coal 
production to 4 times depends on coal market and 
coal fired power plants.
- This is noted and some text adjusted in the report.
- For Chapter C: Primary Reserves and Technology 
Options:
- In paragraph 60, it is mentioned that the 80% of the 
coal production in 2004-2005 is exported to China 
and Thailand and coal export was significantly 
reduced after construction of Tigyit thermal power 
plant. Actually, coal export was reduced due to 
stop production from Maw Taung coal 
mines and it is not because of 
consumption of Tigyit thermal power plant.
This is noted at paragraph 60 revised.
- For Chapter C: Primary Reserves and Technology

- In paragraph 66, the update status of private sector 
participation in coal sector is that 6 companies are

Comment Response
Annual Growth Rate of 2.9% for 
Final Energy Consumption is too 
low as compare to the expected 
GDP growth rate of 7.1%. Its 
growth rate should be at least 5 
or 6%.
The following World Bank statistics for Thailand (THA), Vietnam (VNM), Bangladesh 
(BGD) show that the relationship between GDP growth and energy growth is 
correlated. The growth rate for energy is higher than the rate for GDP per capita. 
Myanmar’s GDP per capita growth has not been published by the World Bank due to 
doubts on the statistics from 2000 to 2010 but most likely the growth rate for energy 
has been lower than for GDP per capita.
The Consultant considers that the GDP and energy growth statistics of Thailand and 
Vietnam in particular are influenced heavily by energy-intensive industry growth; the 
growth in heavy industrial activity has resulted in relatively high energy growth rates. 
The following chart for Industry Value Added includes a time series that is a composite 
of figures agreed by the World Bank (to 2000) and from other sources. Again the 
World Bank has not published figures post-2000 due to doubts regarding the statistics 
– it is considered that the rise in the Industry Value Added statistic since 2000 may not 
be significant – in other words that growth in the energy consumption of the industrial 
sector has been slow until recent times. The energy consumption and production
statistics gathered from the public and private sector energy-intensive industries 
appears to support the likelihood that the Industry Value Added is low. Another way 
to consider this issue is to say that Myanmar is an agriculture + oil / gas economy that 
lacks a strong industry sector at the present time.

MMR -0.2%the last decade, an energy growth rate of 2.9% represents a significant turn-around. 
The figure was derived using bottom-up estimates for each sector but from top-down 
perspective it is not inconsistent with an historical ktoe growth rate of 0.9%. The 
figure of 2.9% compares favorably to the rate of 4% experienced by Bangladesh. 
World Bank Indicators
In any case the accuracy of the energy growth rate forecast is less important than the 
assumptions for the drivers of energy growth, e.g. the growth in passenger vehicles. 
So rather than focussing on the resultant energy growth rate it would be more helpful 
to understand if the assumptions for the drivers of energy growth are reasonable. In 
the meantime there does not appear to be a justification to arbitrarily change the 2.9% 
to a higher rate.
- Expected population growth rate 
of 0.9% is acceptable. However, 
the size of country population 
used in the planning process 
should be based on the 
preliminary result of national 
census. 
-
At the time of preparation of demand forecasts the results of the national census had 
not been validated. Since that time it is apparent that there is agreement between 
national and international experts that the population estimates determined by the 
census are robust. Therefore it is sensible to use the census results. In fact this 
approach was taken before the release of the draft EMP, but the ADB gave 
instructions to revert to the pre-census population for ease of comparison with other 
studies using the pre-census figures and so the higher population was used for 
demand forecasts and expansion planning. 
- Vehicle and income growth rates 
are also expected to change due 
to the new base line population.
The impact of the change in population is not as significant to energy demand 
forecasts as might be expected. This is because the historical demand forecasts 
that are driven by population, were calibrated against reported energy consumption 
(electricity, transport gasoline and diesel, and firewood). The effect of reducing the 
historical population statistics means that the historical per capita energy rates 
increase. When these new energy consumption rates are applied to the (lower) 
projections for population, using the census 2014 figures as a base, the change to the 
total energy consumption is not affected significantly.
The impact on the electricity forecasts is shown in the following chart:-
The ‘medium census’ forecast is based on the census population; the ‘medium old’ 
forecast is based on the ADB time series for the population. The difference in 
population assumption shows in the forecast after 2025. The Consultant considers 
that the difference in the forecast is not significant enough to require rework of the 
electricity expansion modelling. The consumption rises because of the impact of GDP per capita, but again the impact 
is insignificant.
The impact on agriculture has been checked, the difference is also insignificant.
The impact on HH energy consumption has not been checked in detail. Here there 
are two conflicting drivers. If we were to assume fixed kgoe per capita figures for 
urban and rural HH’s then a 15% reduction in population would result in an energy 
consumption reduction of 15%. Against this is that the census revealed that the 
urban population is higher than was assumed for the EMP (and the rural population is 
lower). Since urban energy consumption per HH is higher than for rural HH’s, then 
from overall perspective it is expected that the change to the census population 
statistics will not result in a significant change to the total HH sector energy projection, 
however, the split of energy consumption between urban and rural HH will change and 
the change could be significant. The HH sector estimates will be reworked with the 
census population to verify these opinions.

G. Responses to Comments from Ministry of Energy (MOE) on Draft Final 
Comment Response
Supply Gas (3.4) at Table I-1 Supply 
Projection at Page No. 651, and Consumption 
Gas (4.1) at Table I-3 Energy Consumption at 
Page No. 653 are not the same. Supply gas is 
less than consumption gas.
Two problems surfaced when looking at this issue. 
One was that LPG consumption was incorrectly 
gathered under the Natgas category when the IEA
approach is to gather under Oil. It was noticed that 
light industry consumption was not gathered for some 
years in the IEA tables (from years 2021 to 2030). 
Corrections have been made, and the TFEC table and 
IEA tables revised.
Table III-3 at Page No. 677: Coal (lignite) 
column is missing. 7,542 (Total Primary 
Energy) is not equal to the combination of 
2,832 (Hydro), 314 (Solar PV), 216 (Natural 
Gas) and 57 (Coal bituminous).
The fuel consumption figures were primary quantities 
and summed to the primary energy total, this has been 
clarified by re-arranging the columns in the table.
LPG Column is missing at Table V-3 Natural 
Gas at Page No. 685 and Table V-4 Natural 
Gas at Page No. 686. Different units are used 
there.
In first draft of the Energy Outlook report, LPG was 
accounted for under gas, but it was later remembered 
that, under IEA approach, LPG must be accounted for 
under Oil / Refined Petroleum, not under the Natural 
Gas category. In checking this issue it was noticed 
that Table V-5 included a column for LPG - this column 
has been removed.
Figure I-3 TPES – Fuel Mix 2030 at Page No. 
656 needs to be adjusted in percentage.
This chart and Figure I-2 have been replaced.
Table V-2: Compound Annual Growth Rate 
Projections at Page No. 685: “- 6.2 %” is 
mentioned under Transport. Actually, 
consumers prefer CNG as it is cheaper.
A major barrier to widespread deployment of CNG is 
the availability of onshore gas; as such the 
assumptions was made that widespread use of CNG 
was limited and the view adopted was that we do not 
project increased CNG use. It would be possible to 
run a sensitivity of CNG consumption to understand 
the overall natural gas use if needed but best done by 
way of a demonstration in the development of a 
transport scenario, perhaps in a workshop setting.
Table V-3: Natural Gas TPES Forecast (toe) at 
Page No. 685: Much are reduced under 
Electricity Consumption (2012-2014 were 
finished already.) compared to the previous 
report.
This was the result of having to change our original gas 
consumptions figures over to those provided in the 
ADICA report. Unfortunately not all gas consumption 
projections in all tables and figures had been 
completely updated. We have fixed this and updated 
the figures.
Fix the consistency between the following figures 
/ tables: 
Figure I-3: Myanmar: FEC Projection by Energy 
Carrier (medium) from Consolidated Demand 
Forecasts Chapter
This was related to a change in classification of LPG 
from the gas category to the oil category to be 
consistent with IEA categorisation – this was a late 
change that had not been reflected across all parts of 
the report. This is now fixed.Energy Supply Outlook Chapter
