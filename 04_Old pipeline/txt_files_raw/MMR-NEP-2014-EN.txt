The Myanmar National Electrification Plan (NEP) aims to electrify 100% of Myanmar’s 
households by 2030. According to the Earth Institute’s (EI) geospatial planning results, this 
means connecting more than 7.2 million households over the next 16 years. 
Strong Government commitment to institutional strengthening and reform, and collective 
contribution of resources from consumers, and the Government of Myanmar and its
development partners as well as the private sector are key factors in achieving the NEP’s
ambitious goals.
The Roadmap to 100 percent Electrification
At present, Myanmar has about 2.3 million residential electricity connections. Depending on 
assumptions on household size, this implies that less than 30 percent of the population has 
access to electricity. Schools, clinics, and business in rural areas also have limited access.
At present, approximately 190,000 additional households gain access to electricity every year. 
At this rate, it would take almost 40 years to achieve full electrification. Such a slow rate of 
progress is not acceptable to the Government and the people of Myanmar. The Government 
is committed to achieve 100 percent electrification by 2030. 
An initial comprehensive geospatial plan for the roll-out of electrification estimates that 
around 98 percent of the total new connections will be grid-based. While the electrification 
program will evolve dynamically, the initial plan envisages the least cost roll-out of the grid, 
alongside the development of mini-grid and off-grid solar home solutions. Additionally, 
approximately 250,000 connections using “pre-electrification” solutions such as temporary 
mini grids or off grid solar home systems will be viable for households who can expect to be 
connected to the grid at the very end of the roll-out program.
In all, approximately 7.2 million household connections will be required in the next 16 years 
to fulfill the vision of universal electrification by 2030. This means that the number of 
household connections needs to increase from the current 189,000 a year, to an average of 
450,000 a year over the next 16 years—a more than two fold rise. Given the time required 
for ramp-up, the sustained number of connections once the program reaches maturity will 
be even higher: in excess of 510,000 per year.
The chart below describes the expected roadmap for the number of additional connections.
The analysis of technical and institutional capabilities shows that it will take about two years 
to train sufficient technical and commercial personnel to become able to manage around 
517,000 connections a year. The initial ramp-up means that during the first 5 years of the 
program (FY2015-2019), a total of close to 1.7 million new connections can be made. This 
represents 12.3 percent of all new connections under the roll-out program. This means that 
once the program reaches maturity, it will be expected to implement about 8 percent of all 
new connections in each subsequent year.
Subject to the successful implementation of this plan, Myanmar can be expected to achieve 
approximately 47 percent electrification by 2020, 76 percent electrification by 2025, and 100 
percent by 2030.Figure 1.1: Roadmap to 100 percent Electrification in Myanmar

Investment Prospectus
The total capital cost of the electrification roll-out over 16 years is estimated to be $5.9 
billion. Efficient implementation of the program will require that all capital expenditure is 
financed (so that, as much as possible, repayments can be spread over the economic life of 
the assets). Further investment will be needed in Myanmar’s generation and transmission 
systems in addition to investment in the medium and low voltage networks required for the 
roll-out (as well as investment in off-grid solutions). Additional demand from newly 
connected customers will require approximately 2,600 MW of additional generation capacity 
to be built over the next 16 years. While this Investment Prospectus does not cover the 
financing requirement of the generation and transmission program, the analysis ensures that 
sufficient funding will be available to cover the incremental costs of generation and 
transmission (including the cost of finance).
With close to 1.7 million new connections slated for FY2015-2019, the total financing need 
for the period will be $843million. This amount will cover fixed investment in long-lived 
capital assets ($819.2 million) plus Technical Assistance of $23.8 million.

connections
The figure below puts the financing need for FY2015-2019 within the context of the overall 
financing requirement for the electrification roll-out.

There is a strong development rationale for donors providing all, or most of the financing 
need during this initial roll-out phase. Meeting the financing need through concessional 
donor finance will make a significant development contribution as:
; It will reliably enable Myanmar to achieve the targeted 1.7 million connections in 
the next 5 years. This will not only make significant contribution to the country’s 
development by giving those households access to electricity, it will underwrite 
the ramp-up in both technical and institutional capability required to achieve 100 
percent electrification by 2030.
; It will keep tariffs affordable, which is critical in ensuring that access to electricity 
translates into greater welfare and faster economic growth. Moreover, the long 
tenor of the concessional finance makes sure that the future users of electricity—
who can expect to be substantially better off than the current users—pick up a 
fair share of the burden. In other words, it will ensure that the burden is 
consistent and commensurate with one’s ability to pay among Myanmar 
consumers and on the Government of Myanmar.
; It will support the roll-out program over the period of economic reforms. Over 
time, as Myanmar economy becomes more integrated with the global financial 
system and as the local banking system matures, commercial finance will 
increasingly become available on tenors and other terms that can replace 
concessional finance without a material shock to tariffs.
The Government of Myanmar is already receiving important assistance from the ADB, IFC 
and others, including the framework for competitive tendering for rural electrification and

Institutional Roadmap will require further Technical Assistance over the next 5 years of 
$23.8 million. The TA program will add to the existing work streams and support the setup
of the Executive Secretariat (discussed below), as well as the up-skilling required for ESE, 
YESB, government agencies and domestic banks that could become conduits for donor 
finance to the private sector.
This report considered the feasibility of the roll-out under different tariff scenarios and 
tested sensitivities to different cost assumptions, including the cost of generation. The rollout is feasible if future tariff revenues and subsidies committed by the Government are 
sufficient to cover all costs, including payment of interest and repayment of loans. The longterm financial model developed for this study confirms that under reasonable assumptions, 
viable combinations of affordable tariff revenues and fiscally sustainable Union Budget 
subsidies exist, which will ensure the full funding of the program—allowing loans to be 
repaid when due. 
The figure below summarizes the relationship between tariff levels and the funding gap. The 
funding gap is the difference between total revenues and total cost of the electricity roll-out 
(including operating costs and the costs of incremental generation and transmission) which 
needs to be covered by Government subsidy. 
The largest contributing factor of the funding gap results from keeping the current tariff 
constant in real terms—in other words, the nominal tariff is adjusted each year in line with 
inflation. This tariff produces the funding gap with the present value of approximately $2.17 
billion.
On the other hand, it is possible to set a tariff path that would fully cover the costs of the 
electricity system over the next 40 years, so that no government subsidy would be required 
(and hence, there would be no funding gap). Given the existing structure of tariffs, this 
would require the weighted average tariff of $0.084 per kWh or an average weighted 
residential tariff of approximately $0.05 per kWh over the period.
The Government’s current strategy is to adjust the tariff to ensure that the revenues on the 
existing system cover all cash costs. Even if no roll-out happens, the cash costs of the 
existing system will grow as the already connected customers increase their demand, and new 
generation has to be added at full costs (including return on and of capital) to meet that 
demand. The average tariff that would be required to keep the current system cash neutral is
$0.076 per kWh. This translates into a weighted average residential tariff of $0.043. In other 
words, the weighted average real residential tariff in any case would be expected to increase 
from $0.037 to $0.043—a real rise of 17% on average over the period—under the 
Government’s present policy.Figure 1.3: Funding Gap Sensitivity to Tariff Levels
Note: Points on the horizontal axis represent the weighted average residential tariff
Overall, the tariff strategy needs to ensure that access to electricity is affordable to every 
household in the country: in this way, electrification will make a critical contribution to the 
Government’s poverty reduction objectives. To ensure that the subsidy commitment is 
fiscally sustainable and efficient, the tariff structure will need to be reviewed to align more 
closely with different households’ varying ability to pay.
Implementation Road Map
The report sets out the steps the Government of Myanmar will need to take to implement 
the roll-out program. Financing is not the only challenge Myanmar possesses. Limited 
institutional capability will remain a significant constraint even if financing becomes
available, tariffs are increased, and if the Government commits to future subsidies. 
Moreover, the Government will need to strengthen its capability to assess and implement 
predictable tariff and subsidy policies.
To meet the institutional challenges, the Government will need to ensure high quality sector 
wide coordination, and strengthened implementation capacity within each area of 
responsibility. 
Coordination: There is an urgent need to establish a well-resourced Executive Secretariat 
reporting to the Vice President. The Executive Secretariat should perform a number of roles:

monitor the achievement of the electrification targets

and would advise the Government on managing a coherent financing program for 
the sector-wide plan
; It would provide advice and support to the Ministries involved in implementing 
the aspects of the NEP they will be responsible for.
Electrification on YESB franchise: YESB needs certainty to access financing for
investment, and should be the Government’s immediate objective (within a year). Although
YESB electrification needs are relatively small, these steps are needed both to make the 
YESB itself more sustainable (as well as to improve the quality of its service), and to ensure 
that electricity consumers in Yangon are able to make a financial contribution to the overall 
roll-out program. Given that the cost of service in Yangon is substantially lower than in the 
rest of the country (due to higher population density and a significant proportion of industry 
being concentrated in Yangon), a single national tariff would likely result in a cross-subsidy 
from consumers in Yangon to consumers in the rest of the country. A stable financial 
environment for the YESB can be achieved by:
; Calculating an appropriate cost of service for the YESB, including the cost of 
power purchases and the return on and of capital employed in the distribution 
network
; Determining a tariff that would cover such costs, and
; Creating a mechanism for using any profits from the YESB to contribute to the 
subsidies required for the electrification roll-out.
In the medium term, it will be the role of the regulator to set the Annual Revenue 
Requirement (ARR) for the distribution enterprises. In the short term, this function can be 
performed by the Executive Secretariat.
Electrification on ESE franchise: 96 percent new connections in Myanmar will occur in 
ESE franchise area. For ESE, the Government should follow the same reform path as for 
YESB, focusing in the short term on enabling ESE to access finance for investment.
In addition, it is likely that many connections under the responsibility of ESE will be 
managed by private and community enterprises that will receive a concession for a subfranchise (covering lines below 11kV and household connections). Given the scale of the 
electrification challenge in Myanmar, a multitude of solutions and initiatives should be 
welcomed. However, to ensure orderly process of establishing and implementing such subfranchises, it will be necessary to:
; Make arrangements for a clear delineation of service areas and responsibilities. 
Where private parties or community organizations wish to provide service, they 
should operate below 11kV network, provide a clear geographic description of the 
area in which they will provide the LV and household connection service and take 
on an explicit obligation to serve all customers within that area. In order to obtain 
a sub-franchise, a private or community service provider should be required to file 
a detailed roll-out plan showing how 100 percent electrification within the 
proposed area will be achieved; Ensure that the ESE receives wheeling payments for its MV investments that 
serve such sub-franchises. This will require a determination of wheeling tariff for 
connections below the 11kV level
; Create a mechanism to enable operators of such sub-franchises (whether private 
or community-owned) to access appropriate financing. This should focus on 
enabling a selected Myanmar bank to serve as an effective channel for 
concessional finance
; Create a mechanism for delivering subsidies to these operators where such 
subsidies are required. Such subsidies may be either an initial capital subsidy, or 
the payment of a “shadow” tariff by the Government.
For sub-franchises to be viable, it will be necessary for a proportion of concessional finance 
be channeled via the Myanmar banking system to private operators seeking to establish subfranchise operations.
Mini-Grids: From the perspective of the implementation of the NEP, the issues around the 
development of mini-grids (whether temporary or permanent) are similar to the subfranchising of the ESE areas. DRD should take responsibility for:
; Providing standard processes and standard documentation which sets out the 
obligations of the operator
; Developing a competitive (minimum subsidy) process in response to a local 
initiative, against predictable tariff rules
; Ensuring timely delivery of the subsidy
; Working together with the Executive Secretariat to implement a program of twostep loans via a selected Myanmar bank to enable the operator to access 
concessional finance.
Given the similarities in the issues, the solutions should also be similar. In fact, we would 
recommend that a single set of rules be applied to sub-franchising of grid connections and to 
mini-grids, since the main factor differentiating the two is likely to be the timing of when the 
grid connection occurs. 
Household electrification: the Government needs to move the household electrification 
program (whether temporary or permanent) from the relatively unsustainable give-away of 
solar systems without the users taking ownership and maintenance responsibilities of the 
systems, to an arrangement where customers are provided with energy supply by firms that 
maintain and operate household and village systems. Customers would pay for the energy 
they receive. Private providers would use revenue to cover the costs of maintenance. The 
Government would provide subsidies to ensure that tariff revenues were sufficient to cover 
the costs of the private operator. 
Implementation milestones
Looking back a year or two from now, how will we know that the Roadmap has been a 
success? The following are the key milestones for the implementation of the Roadmap in the 
next 12 months:
; Milestone 1: the Government of Myanmar formally adopts the Roadmap, 
including the institutional implementation plan via a Government Decree; Milestone 2: The Government appoints an Executive Secretariat tasked with 
coordinating the roll-out program and responsible directly to the Vice-President. 
The Executive Secretariat should be empowered by Decree to act as the single 
window for cooperation with Myanmar’s development partners in relation to the 
roll-out program. While various agencies involved in the roll-out (such as the 
Myanmar International Cooperation Agency being set up by MLFRD as the 
implementation enterprise) will have direct engagement with donors, the 
Executive Secretariat should coordinate the overall financing program, helping 
aligning donor preferences with the responsibilities of particular agencies
; Milestone 3: the Government of Myanmar commences a donor pledging process, 
and continue working with donors to secure the full financing package needed for 
the implementation of the program
; Milestone 4: the Government of Myanmar formally and publically instructs the 
Executive Secretariat to conduct a tariff study (with appropriate technical 
assistance) and to conducts public consultation to improve public understanding 
of the costs of the electricity service and of the required tariff decisions. The new 
tariff should be both affordable and consistent with the Government’s fiscal 
constraints
; Milestone 5: the Government of Myanmar appoints advisors to develop a subfranchising mechanism and standard documentation to facilitate private sector 
participation in the roll-out program
; Milestone 6: the Government of Myanmar makes short-term changes to the 
budgeting process for the YESB and the ESE to facilitate more independent 
commercial decision-making and to encourage and enable both to borrow on 
their balance sheet.
The Office of the Vice-President should hold the overall accountability for the 
implementation of the NEP, with each Minister being provided with clear delegations of 
responsibility and corresponding accountability.1 Introduction
National electrification is a top priority of the Government of Myanmar (GoM). The 
Myanmar National Electrification Plan (NEP) aims to achieve 100 percent electrification by 
2030. The scale of the electrification challenge in Myanmar is immense. Currently, the 
electrification rate in the country stands at a mere 28.9%.1 This means that approximately 43
million out of close to 60 million people in the county do not have access to electricity.2 To 
fulfill the vision of universal electrification by 2030, the number of household connections 
needs to increase from the current 189,000 a year to approximately 450,000 a year3to be 
sustained over the next 16 years—a more than two fold rise. Given the time required for a 
ramp-up, we estimate that the sustained number of connections once the program reaches 
maturity will be even higher: in excess of 517,000 per year.
In order to achieve national electrification efficiently and effectively, the NEP needs to be 
backed by (i) a sound least cost roll-out plan, (ii) sufficient funding and financing to build out 
the network and (iii) capable and robust institutions to coordinate and direct the program.
This report presents intermediate targets and milestones to achieve universal access by 2030, 
which is the financing and funding requirements along with the institutional roadmap for 
Myanmar’s NEP for the period of 5 financial years, 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2020 (from 
April to March follows the cycle of the fiscal year in Myanmar). As a short-hand, we refer to 
this as the 5 year period from 2015 to 2019, indicating the commencement of the financial 
year. This initial period of the NEP is a time during which technical and institutional 
capability will be ramped up to create the platform for achieving the overall target by 2030. 
However, to ensure the sustainability of the overall program, the financial analysis is based 
on a 55-year financial model, which covers the period during which debt has to be repaid.
This report is structured as follows: 
; In Section 2 we describe the least cost roll-out plan and the financing need for the 
period FY2015-2019. This is the Investment Prospectus part of the report: we 
summarize the total amount of finance that is required for the roll-out, and 
consider sources 
; In Section 3 we explain how we derived the total connections target for the 
period FY2015-2019
; In Section 4 we explain our analysis of the costs of roll-out, and consider the 
sensitivities to various assumptions
; In Section 5 we consider the funding of the roll out: we confirm whether the rollout can be funded through a combination of affordable tariffs and Government 
subsidies

to implement the NEP
; In Section 7 we consider the technical assistance needs of NEP implementation
; We set out key conclusions in Section 8.
Throughout this report we draw a clear distinction between the financing and the funding
of the roll out. This distinction is crucial to the analysis of financial viability of the NEP, and 
to understanding how the burden will be allocated between consumers, the Government of 
Myanmar, and development partners. In essence, financing is the money that has to be 
returned over time, while funding is the money that does not require return. These terms are 
explained fully in the box below.
 Box 1.1: The Difference Between Funding (Cost Recovery) and Financing
It is important not to confuse the need for financing with the need for subsidies. Subsidies 
address the cost recovery problem, while financing problems may exist even if total costs 
are fully funded through a combination of tariffs and subsidies.
Figure 1 shows the situation of an infrastructure service provider with a need for financing. 
The service provider needs to make a major initial investment, such as an electricity 
distribution system extension. In the future, during the operational phase of the project, 
the service will be able to sell electricity at a tariff which recovers the full cost of service. If 
the present value of the cash flows during the operational phase exceeds the present value 
of the negative cash flow during the investment phase, the provider will have recovered the 
full costs of service. In this case, the project is fully funded, and providers should be able
to get financing, for example by borrowing to pay for the initial investment, and repaying 
the debt from the positive cash flow during the operational phase.
Figure 2 shows the situation of an infrastructure service provider with a cost recovery 
problem. Total revenues from all sources (tariffs and subsidies) are lower than total costs, 
including capital costs.4 The provider whose situation is illustrated in this figure has a cost 
recovery problem. The project is not fully funded: that is, there is not enough income 
(tariffs and subsidies) being generated to cover total costs (operating and capital) for the 
foreseeable future. No amount of financial engineering would enable the service provider 
to access finance.
 
4 Capital costs are meant to include both the cost of capital assets being used up and needed to be replaced, usually 
measured by depreciation, and the need to provide a return on capital invested, for example by making interest payments 
on a loan or allowing an equity investor to earn dividends.Figure 1 : Financing Need

FY2015-2019
In this section we explain the approach to planning the least-cost electrification rollout for 
the next 5 years, and the implication of this plan for the need to raise finance. We also 
explain why meeting this financing need through concessional donor finance would have 
high development impact.
The least-cost electrification plan targets to achieve 100 percent electrification by 2030. 
Current estimates suggest that this will require 7,216,638 new residential connections over 
the next 16 years. This estimate includes projected population growth between now and 
2030. Of course, the electrification program will evolve dynamically, both as more 
information becomes available and as on-the-ground conditions change over time.
The program will need to start with a steady ramp up from the current rate of 189,000 
connections per year, to a steady state of around 517,000 connections per year. The details 
are further explained later in this report. The chart below describes the expected roadmap 
for the number of connections achieved.
If the Government of Myanmar implements this plan, Myanmar can be expected to achieve 
approximately 47 percent electrification by 2020, 76 percent electrification by 2025, and 100 
percent by 2030. Of course, we recognize that the last 10 to 20 percent of the electrification 
program will be particularly difficult, both from the engineering and financial perspective. 
The medium term financial plan incorporates the expected funding and financing 
requirements for full electrification, but the focus of this report is on the funding and 
financing needs over the next 10 years. Future needs will become confirmed as geospatial 
information required for planning continues to be updated and improved. 
Figure 2.1: Roadmap to 100 percent Electrification in Myanmar
Source: Castalia and EI estimates2.1 Least-cost Roll-out
This Prospectus is based on the detailed geospatial planning undertaken by Earth Institute 
(EI) in cooperation with the Government of Myanmar. This planning work underscores the 
fact that this Prospectus is not a hypothetical request for funds from development partners, 
but rather a concrete analysis of a least-cost expansion which incorporates technical and 
economic aspects. 
The geospatial plan identifies the best way to achieve full electrification by 2030 (with a 
particular focus on the next five years), based on the physical characteristics of different 
locations within the country. The roll-out plan is conducted at a programmatic level, and 
further detailed design and planning work will be completed as the program is implemented. 
The EI analysis combines geospatial information (covering the location of population 
clusters, load centres, the existing medium voltage (MV) lines, as well as the existing and 
planned transmission lines) with the cost information of MV and LV grid lines, transformers,
and mini-grid generation options. The technical model further incorporates population 
growth and electricity demand forecasts. 
EI then applies a planning algorithm which identifies the least cost electrification solution 
for each location. This algorithm identifies which settlements would best be served through 
connection to the national grid, and which would be best through mini-grid and off-grid 
solutions (individual household level solar home systems). 
For connection to the national grid, the algorithm develops an optimal connection sequence
roll-out plan. Initial phases of grid construction reach areas that are closest to the existing
grid, where less extension of the MV lines is needed per household. Later phases reach the 
next closest areas, toward rural remote communities where more MV lines are required. 
Overall, under a least-cost roll-out, grid connections are prioritized in areas that meet higher 
electricity demand with the shortest MV line extension. 
The key conclusion from this geospatial modelling is that the least-cost way to extend 
electrification to 98 per cent of the population in Myanmar is through connection to the
national grid. Approximately 98 percent of the population of the country live within 50km of 
an existing or planned transmission line, with 92 percent living within 25km.
The overall plan is illustrated in the figure below.Figure 2.2: Recommended Electrification Solutions
Source: Earth Institute
For the national least-cost plan, the level of focus is the country as a whole. This means that 
in states where the cost of grid connection is relatively high, no connection may be made 
until the average cost of new connection in other states reaches that level. As we discuss later 
in the report, it is possible to change the priority accorded to each state, while preserving the 
least-cost sequence within each state. However, the national least-cost plan shows the 
greatest value for money that is possible over the next five years. For the given amount of resources, it identifies the greatest number of connections that can be made. Conversely, for 
a given connection target, it shows the least amount of resources that would be required. 
Our analysis based on EI research shows that under the national least-cost plan, during the 
five year period of FY2015-2019, zero new connections will be made in Kayah State, and 
only few will be made in the Yangon Region. In practice—given YESB’s recent 
performance—it is likely that Yangon Region will achieve close to 100 percent electrification 
during the period of FY 2015-2019.
The national least-cost rollout by state and region for the first five years is shown in the table 
below.

FY2015-2019
The national least cost plan provides the key benchmark for the electrification roll-out. The 
Government of Myanmar may legitimately change the sequence of the roll-out for social, 
economic, or political reasons. However, while it would be appropriate for the development 
partners to support the financing needs of the least-cost program, the burden of additional 
costs incurred due to policy decisions made by the Government may more appropriately fall 
on the Government.
In addition to the national least-cost grid roll-out, we assume most of the areas that are 
slated to be electrified through off-grid solutions in the first five years. While there is no 
specific efficient sequence for off-grid projects, prioritizing such projects would contribute 
to the overall social cohesion by enabling people in remote communities to be among early 
beneficiaries of electrification. We also incorporate a provision for a “pre-electrification” 
program: an out of sequence off-grid electrification of areas that will eventually—but 
possibly only in the late 2020s—be connected to the grid. As we discuss later in the report, 
there are likely to be numerous situations where such off-grid or household solar solutions 
would be efficient in providing electricity to these households, prior to grid connection 
which will only be possible in the later phase.
2.2 The Financing Need
The purpose of this Investment Prospectus is to identify the financing that needs to be 
raised for the electrification targets for the 5-year period to be met. In principle, there are 
three possible constraints on the pace of electrification:
; The existence of sufficient technical and institutional capability to implement the 
roll-out; The availability of financing
; The ability and willingness to pay for electricity by the households and businesses 
that will be connected.
For the purposes of estimating the financing need for the five year period, we start with the 
assumption that the binding constraint over the period is the limited technical and 
institutional capability. In other words, we assume that sufficient financing will be found to 
under-write the maximum technically possible number of connections. We then separately 
confirm that it is viable to fund the additional electrification fully through a combination of 
concessional financing, affordable tariffs, and government subsidies.
To achieve 100 percent electrification by 2030, approximately 7.2 million currently un-served 
households will need to be connected over the 16 year period. From the technical and 
institutional point of view, we estimate that it will be feasible to connect approximately 1.7 
million households in the five year period from FY2015 to 2019. By 2020, the annual 
capacity to make connections will be ramped up to the level that would enable the remaining 
un-served households to be connected over the following 10 years. 
We use the geospatial planning results provided by EI to derive the technical solution for 
each household, (i.e. on-grid or off-grid, and the type of off-grid solution), and the cost of 
that solution. 
The costs of an electrification roll-out include gross capital expenditures of the program, as 
well as operating costs. The capital invested in the roll-out—the poles, wires, transformers,
and generation units—will have long asset lives. Since such assets provide services over a 
period of time, it is efficient to finance their cost, so that payment (paying both for the 
return on, and of capital) is spread over the expected economic life. By contrast, operating 
costs incurred in any year should usually be covered by revenues and subsidies provided in 
that year. Spreading the cost of capital assets over time through financing ensures that todays 
and future users share the burden fairly. By contrast, financing to cover the costs of 
recurrent operating costs defers the burden to future users.
For this reason, we assume that in order to connect approximately 1.7 million households 
over the next five years, financing will be needed to cover the program’s gross capital 
expenditures. 
Overall, we estimate that approximately $819.2 million of financing will be required over 5 
years. We note that this financing need relates only to the electrification distribution roll-out, 
which includes MV and LV distribution networks, mini-grids, and household electrification. 
Further financing will be required for generation and transmission investment programs. 
The table below shows the annual financing need over the next five years.

Total Capex $91.5 $106.0 $114.9 $188.8 $294.2 Note: Includes 10% capex contingency, and that there is no capital replacement for pre-electrification
connections
2.3 Development Rationale for Donor Financing
The NEP is being implemented at the same time as Myanmar’s economy is undergoing 
general transformation. The Institutional Plan for the implementation of the roll-out 
envisages a growing role for the private sector, including reliance on private finance through 
a mix of equity and commercial borrowing. However, in the immediate future, access to 
appropriate finance is severely constrained:
; The Myanmar banking system is poorly developed. No banks in Myanmar offer 
loans for periods of more than 2 to 3 years, and re-financing of existing debt is 
extremely difficult. We understand that Village Electrification Committees 
(VECs) often are only able to borrow for 3 to 6 months to spread the cost of 
connecting ones village if needed. Hence, any finance that could be obtained from 
the Myanmar banking system would require rapid amortization through tariffs or 
subsidies
; The Myanmar banking system has little experience of project financing 
infrastructure developments. Hence, there would likely be delays in securing the 
necessary credit, at whatever cost and tenor
; The Myanmar banking system is unlikely to be able to accommodate overall credit 
demand of over $100 million per year from the sector
; While international commercial lenders may be willing to finance electricity 
generation IPPs in Myanmar, it is unlikely that such lenders would be able to 
provide systematic and reliable support to the distribution roll out without 
significant structural reforms, such as full corporatization of YESB and ESE, and 
the introduction of an independent electricity regulator. Again, such reforms 
would take time and delay the implementation of the electrification roll-out
; Finally, the cost of commercial finance is initially likely to be substantially higher 
than the cost of finance provided by development partners. Myanmar is still seen 
as a high risk investment destination. Over time, the risk premium of lending to 
Myanmar businesses will decline.
We conclude that without substantial support from the development partners, the objective 
of achieving close to 1.7 million connections in the next 5 years would not be met: it would 
be unrealistic to expect to raise the required $645.5 million over the period from commercial 
sources, and even if this amount could be financed, the burden on the consumers and the 
Government of Myanmar of servicing such debt at commercial rates and tenors would not 
be sustainable. For example, we estimate that electricity tariffs would need to rise from the 
current weighted average of $0.064, to $0.27/kWh. The top range of the tariff increase is 
particularly influenced by the short term loan repayments which are currently prevalent in 
Myanmar. We are not aware of any commercial or state banks in Myanmar offering loans of 
more than 5 years for commercial projects. Our interviews with Village Electrification 
Committees indicate that if there were some sort of financing has been available for 
electrification projects, it ranged within less than year up to three years.In effect, to keep tariffs affordable and to achieve the 100 percent access without access to 
concessional finance, the Government would have to substantially increase its current 
funding commitment to the sector. This does not appear possible, given the existing fiscal 
constraints. Even if it were possible, such fiscal commitment would undermine the 
Government’s other national development objectives, deter private sector participation in 
the sector, and likely lead to less efficient implementation.
Given the existing financing constraints, meeting the financing need through concessional 
donor finance will make a significant development contribution:
; It will reliably enable Myanmar to achieve the targeted 1.7 million connections in 
the next 5 years. Not only will this make a significant contribution to the country’s 
development by giving those households access to electricity, it will underwrite 
the ramp-up in both technical and institutional capability required to achieve full 
electrification by 2013
; It will ensure that the burden on Myanmar consumers and on the Government of 
Myanmar is consistent with their ability to pay. In the absence of donor financing, 
tariffs may rise to unaffordable levels. The long tenor of the concessional finance 
makes sure that the future users of electricity—who can expect to be substantially 
better off than the current users—pick up a fair share of the burden
; It will support the roll-out program over the period of economic reforms. Over 
time, as Myanmar’s economy becomes more integrated with the global financial 
system, and as the local banking system matures, commercial finance will 
increasingly become available which can replace concessional finance without a 
material shock to tariffs.3 Target Number of Connections
EI’s assessment of the total number of connections required to electrify Myanmar’s entire 
population by 2030 is summarized in Table 3.1 below:

We estimate that over the next five years (FY2015-2019), it will be technically feasible to 
implement close to 1.7 million additional connections, or 12.3 percent of the total
connections expected under the roll-out program. By contrast, the total capital expenditure 
during that period will be only 4 percent of the expected total cost of the entire roll-out 
program, since the easiest and cheapest connections will be made first. 
3.1 Grid Connections Ramp Up
Our analysis of the capability constraints suggests a ramp up profile for grid connections
shown in Table 3.2 below. This was developed (i) using historical data for new annual 
connections from the two distribution utilities—Electricity Supply Enterprise (ESE) and 
Yangon Electricity Supply Board (YESB), (ii) conducting interviews with ESE/YESB 
engineers and management, as well as village electrification committees to assess physical 
and institutional capacity, (iii) benchmarking ramp up rates from similar developing 
countries.
Overall, we understand that both the private and public sectors in Myanmar are likely to be 
short of approximately 1,000 trained electrical workers required for the implementation of 
the roll-out. We estimate that it will take up to two years to train the required personnel, with 
on-going commitment to training in the future.Table 3.2 below provides the estimated annual grid connections ramp up between 2015 to 
2019.
Table 3.2: Ramp Up in Annual Grid Connections (2015- 2019)
New Total 
Connections 
Required

YESB 207,752 130,000 130,000 77,752 0 0 0
Total 205,000 227,752 225,000 337,500 517,170
The specific assumptions around this ramp up as are follows:
; YESB continues to connect households at its current rate, until all of Yangon is 
connected. This takes only two years, since 78% of Yangon is already electrified.
; ESE increases connections by 20% in the first year, as service providers (such as 
private contractors) respond to an increased volume of work by being more 
productive with existing resources. Resources include adequately skilled labor as 
well as physical resources (materials, equipment and so forth)
; Connections on the ESE franchise area double in the second year through 
additional resources recruited by ESE and through greater reliance on the private 
sector, plus some reallocation from freed up YESB resources
; Connections on the ESE franchise area increase by approximately 50% in years 
three and four through additional resources and growth in the private sector, 
including completion of training by approximately 1,000 additional electricians
; Year five is the first “steady state” year. From this point on the same number of 
connections are made to end of the roll out.
YESB and ESE currently perform a limited range of work themselves: a substantial 
proportion of MV/LV line installation and household connections is currently performed by 
private contractors. At present, such private providers may be contracted by YESB and ESE 
themselves, or by Village Electrification Committees (VECs). However, the capacity of the 
private sector is also constrained due to limited level of activity in this sector until now. As 
the volume of contracting increases, both the public and the private sectors will develop new 
capabilities. On the public side, the increase in the volume of contracting will require further 
enhanced procurement capability. In recent years, capex by ESE amounted to about $20 
million to $40 million per year, while the capex by YESB has been between $15 million and 
$30 million. This total capex of between $35 million and $70 million a year will need to rise 
consistently to reach over $230 million within 5 years.
3.2 Permanent Mini-grid and Off-grid Connections Ramp Up
EI’s geospatial analysis indicates that only a very small proportion of households can expect 
to be permanently served by mini-grid and off-grid solutions: fewer than 11,000 households 
will be served by mini-grids, and fewer than 5,000 will be served by household solutions. For 
the purposes of this Investment Prospectus, we assume that all of these households will be 
connected during the next five years. In practice, since many of these households are extremely isolated and poor, it is difficult to 
predict exactly when they will become served. However, we think it is reasonable to assume 
that their basic needs can be addressed fairly quickly: 
; Mini-grid and off-grid connections make up a small part of the overall 
electrification program—0.15% and 0.06% of total connections respectively. With 
a concerted effort, they can be completed quickly
; EI’s results have shown that there is no clear way to rank mini-grid and off-grid 
connections in least cost order, since they cost nearly the same per connection 
across the country
; Our fieldwork has revealed that mini-grid and off-grid connections are proceeding 
rapidly across the country, so the envisaged five year time period to make all 
mini-grid and off-grid connections by the least cost plan is reasonable. 
Overall, we would like to emphasize that the number of permanent non-grid connections in 
question is so small, that the timing makes almost no difference to the financing need 
(although clearly, a lot of difference to those households).
3.3 Pre-electrification Connections Ramp Up
We assume that out of a total of 7.21 million households that will be connected to the grid, 
some proportion will be in areas where a temporary mini-grid or other “pre-electrification”
such as a household solar solution may be viable. Since the grid roll-out may not reach these 
areas for 10 or more years, it is implausible to expect that residents and businesses in some 
of them will not find alternative solutions in the meantime. In due course, these preelectrified areas will be connected to the grid. 
Assuming the least-cost grid rollout is on target and finished by 2030, the net benefits from 
pre-electrification are greatest—and pre-electrification is most commercially viable—during 
the first five years. This is because it will allow capital costs of setting up a diesel mini-grid or 
diesel-solar hybrid systems to be largely amortized, before the grid arrives. This is based on 
EI’s assumption that diesel generators (main additional cost of diesel and diesel-hybrid
solutions) have to be replaced after 10 years. In other cases, existing local renewable energy 
sources will enable pre-electrification, which will remain as a viable source of generation 
even after grid connection in the later phase. Finally, household solar solutions may also be 
available prior to the grid arriving in an area. 
Overall, it appears that the opportunity for commercially viable pre-electrification may exist 
in areas that serve around 250,000 households over the entire period, and around 100,000 of 
these could be done in the first five years. Although it is difficult to accurately predict the 
extent of local initiative, the financing availability, the institutional support, or the availability 
of local renewable energy sources that will spur pre-electrification connections, we assume a 
gradual ramp up in such connections over the next five years. 
For the purposes of this Prospectus, we draw on the analysis of pre-electrification options 
prepared by EI and include a broad estimate of possible financing required to provide a 
reasonable level of support for pre-electrification. 
In the base case we have assumed majority of the pre-electrification solutions will use solar 
or solar-diesel hybrid solutions, with lower performance levels than the permanent solutions. 
However, another option would be to assume nearly all pre-electrification connections would be diesel based. The choice of technology affects the capex and opex profile. Diesel 
systems have overall lower capex requirements but higher opex requirements than solar or 
diesel-solar hybrid systems. For example the capex for the same number of diesel-based preelectrification connections in the first five years would have been about US$149 million less, 
However, in present value terms the total costs regardless of the technology are roughly the 
same, and therefore do not have an impact on the funding gap. In reality it is likely that preelectrification solutions will lie somewhere in between the two scenarios described. The 
Government and donors will tend towards sponsoring solar hybrids and other renewables, 
while private operators will prefer diesel systems.
While it is challenging to predict exactly which households across Myanmar will be covered 
by pre-electrification, EI identified states that will be connected towards the end of the 
program (due to high connection costs), and are therefore more likely to pre-electrify. These 
states include Chin, Shan, Kachin and Kayah. However for financial modeling purposes, the 
location of these pre-electrification connections is largely irrelevant.4 Costs of the Roll-out
We have developed a 55-year financial model to estimate the annualized costs of the 
electrification roll-out. This model allows us to estimate the revenue requirement of 
Myanmar’s electricity system, as well as consider the implications of different tariff levels for 
the requirement for Government subsidy. 
To understand the financial viability of the roll-out, we model the distribution roll-out as a 
stand-alone “business” over a period from 2015 to 2070—that is, the period during which all 
loans will be fully amortized. This allows us to examine the effects of different tariff 
assumptions on:
; The extent to which newly connected households will fund the services they will 
receive
; The extent to which the existing electricity consumers will contribute to the 
funding of the electrification roll-out
; The level of government subsidy required.
A further benefit of looking at the “new” and “old” distribution systems as separate 
businesses is that it allows us to pinpoint the incidence of subsidy. This is important since 
many components of the roll-out will actually be implemented by stand-alone businesses 
(such as private mini-grids or private concessionaires of distribution sub-franchises), and 
each one of them will need to be financially viable.
Our financial model for the ‘new” distribution system combines three cost areas:
; Distribution capex and opex—The capital and operating costs of the 
distribution infrastructure needed for the rollout as well as the capital and 
operating costs of generation in areas identified as more suitable for mini-grids. 
This analysis is derived from work of EI. 
; Return on and return of capital—This is the cost of finance, and the tenor of 
such finance.
For the purpose of this analysis, we assume that all the capex for the rollout 
program is financed with concessional loans. The assumed loan terms, modeled 
along IDA lines, are given in Table 4.1 below:
Table 4.1: Assumed Loan Terms for Donor Finance
Interest Rate 1.25 percent Annual
Grace Period 5 years No principal payments due for first five years. Interest 
is payable from year 1.
Term of Loan 25 years From year of drawdown
Start year Project year when financing is disbursed for capex required in that year
; Additional infrastructure costs–The capital and operating costs of additional 
infrastructure needed to support the rollout. This includes:– New build generation to provide the energy to additional customers. At 
present, the Government of Myanmar, with support from its development 
partners, is undertaking a review of its generation plan, and developing a leastcost generation plan. Pending the preparation of this plan, we have assumed 
that all new generation is prices at its Long-Run Marginal Cost (LRMC), i.e. a 
price per kWh which fully covers the return on and return of capital, as well as 
operating costs, of new generation under reasonable load factor assumptions
– New build transmission lines to supply the expanded distribution system. 
Again, since we do not have sufficient information on the timing of the 
transmission projects, we estimate the cost of transmission on the LRMC basis
– New build distribution lines—mainly 33 kilo volt (kV) lines to support the 
expanded distribution system.
For the “old” distribution system, we model:
; Existing infrastructure costs–This is in two parts:
– The current annualized cash costs of the existing generation, transmission and 
distribution infrastructure. We assume that the GoM will not seek to earn a 
return on capital from the capital already sunk into the system (although since 
the cash costs include payments to Independent Power Producers (IPP), and 
since IPPs have to earn return on and of capital, not all value of sunk capital is 
ignored) 
– The maintenance and refurbishment capital to replace the existing 
infrastructure as it reaches the end of its economic life, as well as any 
additional expenditure to improve current reliability levels 
; New build generation—This is the cost of additional generation required to 
meet the growing demand from existing customers. Again, we model this on the 
LRMC basis.
The analysis of the above cost components allows us to calculate the total annual revenue 
required to cover all cash expenses of the roll-out for each year—that is all operating 
expenses, plus all interest on loans in addition to any amortization of loans. These annual 
amounts will depend on the rate at which new connections are made, as well as on the terms 
of finance that is available for the roll-out.
We discuss the sensitivities of costs to various assumptions in Section 4.4. One of the key 
sensitivities is the cost of finance: the concessional rate of 1.25 percent is unlikely to be 
available for the entire roll-out program. In our model, we have built-in a contingency for an 
increase in the cost of finance. Overall, it is reasonable to expect that over time the cost of 
finance would increase, but the actual costs of the roll-out and system operations would 
decline as the economy of scale is realized and as a greater role emerges for the private 
sector.
Our model is set out in constant real US dollars. In other words, it does not consider the 
effects of inflation. Such effects need to be added to any calculations of future tariffs in 
kyats. For example, if a tariff were to remain constant in real US dollar terms, it would in fact 
need to increase by about 5 percent per annum in kyats, given the recent inflation trends.The system average tariff required to cover all costs over the 40-year period is a unit cost 
estimate of the overall electrification program. We estimate that the average real cost of 
electrification in Myanmar over the period is $0.084 (8.4 cents) per kWh.
Below we present our estimates of the capital costs (capex) and the operating costs (opex) of 
the entire program.
4.1 Capital Costs
The capital cost components associated with grid-based electrification are shown in the 
figure below:
Table 4.2: Capital Costs for Grid Electrification (US$ Million)
National Least Cost 
2015 2016 2017 2018 2019
LV lines $20.5 $22.8 $22.5 $33.8 $51.7
Service drop, meter etc $41.0 $45.6 $45.0 $67.5 $103.4
Transformer $4.4 $4.9 $4.9 $9.4 $14.7
MV lines $0.0 $0.0 $0.1 $16.6 $41.3
Capex replacement cost* $0.0 $0.0 $0.0 $0.0 $0.0
Contingency Cost (10% of capex) $6.6 $7.3 $7.3 $12.7 $21.1
Total $72.5 $80.6 $79.8 $139.9 $232.2
*Since all the grid-based capital assets have lifetimes of longer than five years, no capital
replacement is necessary in the first five years of the program
Our capex estimates are based on current costs for the required inputs observed in 
Myanmar. However, we have added a contingency provision on the expectation, assuming 
that initial ramp-up may involve less than optimal procurement and learning. We expect that 
unit costs should decline over time as the benefits of scale are realized.
For the mini-grid and off-grid connections, we anticipate that there will be a ramp up over 
time. However, since this makes almost no difference to financial modeling, for ease of 
analysis we have assumed that an equal number of connections are made each year. This 
assumption allows us to see the scale of each component more clearly. 
The components of capital costs for permanent mini-grids, pre-electrification (assuming 
majority solar and solar hybrid systems), and off-grid are shown in the table below:Table 4.3: Mini-grid, Pre-electrification and Off-grid Capex (US$ Million)

Total cost as part of roll out $3.0
Household Solar 2015-2019
Solar Panel $4.5
Solar Battery $5.1
Solar Balance of System $2.3
Capex Replacement Cost* $0.0
Contingency Cost (10% of capex) $1.1
Total cost as part of roll out $13.0
Pre-electrification (base case) 2015-2019
Capex (mini-grid and off grid)* $156.96
Capex replacement cost $0.0
Contingency Cost $17.44
Total additional pre-electrification $174.4
*Note that actual pre-electrification capex will depend on the decisions about technology choice The 
total capex of the roll-out program to 2030 is estimated at $5.8 billion. We estimate the 
present value of the program at $1.8 billion. Present value estimates are used to assess the 
funding gap and the relative contribution of different stakeholders to the sector-wide cash 
flows.
4.2 Operating Costs
The present value of operating costs (opex) of the whole program, broken up by grid, minigrid, and off-grid is estimated at around $2.9 billion5
. The opex includes generation and 
transmission costs. For diesel mini-grids, we estimate the variable cost of generation. For the 
grid, we assume that additional transmission and generation enter at their Long-Run 
Marginal Cost (LRMC). 
In other words, in present value terms, more than 62% of the roll-out program is due to 
operating costs—particularly the purchase of energy—and only 38% is due to the 
 
5 Note once again that the exact annual operating costs will depend on the choice of pre-electrification technology. But the 
total effect will be negligible since the pre-electrification program is very small compared to the required grid based 
expansion.distribution system capex. This underscores the importance of ensuring that the least cost 
generation plan is implemented alongside the least-cost distribution roll-out plan.
The table below shows costs per MWh of various components of service. It illustrates the 
effect of blending in additional generation at LRMC of $92.35 per MWh to the existing 
generation with an average cash cost of $52.41.

Transmission $15.33 $15.33 $15.33 $15.33 $15.33 $15.33
4.3 Demand Assumptions
We assume that demand by households newly connected to the grid or a mini-grid follows 
an “S-curve”. We assume that demand (and consumption) is350kWh/year—a minimum 
level associated with minimum use of appliances, in the first year of being connected. For 
each connection, we assume this grows to 1000kWh/year over five years. After five years of 
being connected, we assume that demand by existing customers grows by 3% per annum. 
The growth in electricity demand per connection over time is shown in Table 4.5 below:
Table 4.5: Annual Electricity Demand per Grid and Mini-Grid Connection (2015-2030)
 
6
Includes a $2/MWh additional cost to improve the reliability of the existing Transmission system The overall demand for grid and mini-grid connections is calculated from a combination of 
growth in connections and growth in demand from each connection over time.
An estimate of demand is an important determinant for the estimate of opex, as it 
determines the units of energy that must be paid for.
4.4 Key Sensitivies
The key sensitivity for costs arises out of the decisions made about different priorities for the 
distribution roll-out. 
As our base case, we use the national least-cost roll-out. As the name suggests, this assumes 
that the cheapest connections wherever they happen to be in the country, are made first. As 
we explained previously, this pattern of grid roll-out delivers the biggest “bang for the buck” 
over the five year period: it identifies the least amount of financing required to connect 
approximately 1.7 million households.
We are conscious, however, that the Government’s priorities may be driven by 
considerations other than the cost of connection. In some cases, because of social or 
economic reasons, it may be desirable to prioritize connections in parts of the country where 
it costs more per household to connect. To test the effects of such decisions on the 
financing need, we develop two further connection scenarios.
We would like to emphasize that all scenarios assume least-cost progression at the local level. 
In other words, the pattern of connection always follows proximity to the existing medium 
voltage (MV) line, with the MV line extensions built once the nearest households are 
connected. 
4.4.1 Proportional Connections Roll-out Scenario
In the Proportional connections scenario, states and regions contribute proportionally to the 
total number of connections that need to be made each year. For example Ayerawady, with 
1.09 million total connections to be made over the 16 year roll out period will contribute 
11,700 in year one, whereas Kayah with only 27,000 connections to be made will contribute 
290. This scenario thus favors states and regions with the largest total number of connections to be made. From a policy perspective, this scenario could be rationalized as 
focusing resources on the states and regions with the largest electrification challenge in terms 
of households left to be connected.

Thaninthayri 4.6% 3,462 6,925 10,387 15,581 26,045
This scenario increases the total cost of MV connections over 5 years by $136.6 million. In 
other words, the total financing need under this scenario increases over the period from 
$645.5 million, to $785.1 million. This additional capex would need to be funded by the 
Government of Myanmar as a result of its policy decisions.
4.4.2 Targeted Connections Roll-out Scenario
The targeted connections scenario favors the states and regions that have the lowest existing 
electrification rates. The assumed focus of the first five years is to bring them to the national 
average. We have developed this scenario using existing electrification rates from MOEP, 
shown in Table 4.7 below. We use existing electrification rates to calculate how many total 
connections need to be made over the five year period, and then allow the states and regions 
to contribute proportionally in the period after 2019.

As seen above, Kayah and Naypitaw are assumed to receive no new connections during the 
period because they already exceed the national average. This scenario increases the total 
cost of MV connections over 5 years by $89.2 million. In other words, the total financing
need under this scenario increases from $645.5 million to $737.7 million over the period.
This additional capex would need to be funded by the Government of Myanmar as a result 
of its policy decisions.
4.4.3 Sensitivity to Generation Cost
For the purposes of this study, we did not conduct a detailed investigation of generation 
options and costs in Myanmar. Technical assistance to analyze least-cost generation was 
under way concurrently with this study. Pending the results of that analysis, we needed to 
come up with a practical way to calculate the average long run marginal cost (LRMC) of 
generation for new demand growth. We did this by using international and Myanmar specific 
information on the costs of different generation technologies, and identifying a likely 
generation mix to calculate the blended cost. 
Different generation technologies play different roles in meeting the total demand as it varies 
both during a typical day and seasonally:
; Peaking generation—typically open cycle gas turbines or diesel plants which 
have low construction costs and thus low fixed costs, but high fuel costs. This is 
the most economical technology to supply peak demand: load that only occurs for 
a few hours in the day is best served through technology with low fixed costs and 
high variable costs
; Base load generation—typically hydro or coal-fired plants that have much 
higher capital costs but much lower fuels costs. Technologies with high fixed 
costs and low variable costs the most economical technology to supply load that 
is constant for most of the day. There are also mid merit order plants that sit between peak and base load generation. In each 
case, the plant needs to be optimized to its expected capacity factor. The capacity factor is 
the proportion of time during which each plant will be utilized.
Our analysis starts by estimating the fixed (capital) and variable (largely fuel) costs of three 
generation options:
; Peak: Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT)
; Mid merit: Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT); and
; Base load: Hydro.
We then calculated the total annual cost for each technology of generation at various 
capacity factors. We show the results in Figure 4.1.
Figure 4.1: Annual Generation Costs and Load Factors
For example at capacity factors below 21%, OCGT has lower levelized costs than CCGT. 
Similarly with capacity factors above 56%, Hydro will have a lower levilized cost of 
generation than CCGT.
Next, we applied these capacity factors to an estimated load duration curve—that is the 
demand in each hour of the year sorted from highest demand to lowest demand. We 
developed a hypothetical load duration curve using the data from Myanmar and from similar 
electricity systems (given the current energy shortages, the existing load duration curve in 
Myanmar may be misleading). We show the hypothetical load duration curve and the 
resulting generation mix in Figure 4.2.

This shows that hydro plants would generate almost 100 percent of the time, meet 56 
percent of the total demand, and would provide 62 percent of energy (the area of the blue 
shaded region). From the curve we also estimated the percentage of energy each generation 
type would likely meet. We detail this in Table 4.8 below.

Average 72% $74.41 100%
After transmission losses (6.1 percent) and distribution losses (averaging about 17.5 percent),
the LRMC of generation per MWh of demand delivered to customers averages $92.35. This 
is in line with the JICA “National Electricity Master Plan” in which generation costs across 
three scenarios (prior to transmission and distribution losses) range from $69.50/MWh to 
$72.20/MWh with a recommended scenario cost of $71.80/MWh.7

Changing the cost of hydro has a proportionately larger effect than changing the cost of gas,
since hydro provides the highest share of energy. There is little effect from rising gas prices 
as hydro can provide a greater portion of the energy demand with very little change in its 
levelized cost. It is useful to note that coal could be considered as an alternative to large 
hydro. Coal is essentially the same cost as hydro at high load factors. We would therefore 
expect that should hydro cost increase substantially relative to coal, then coal will likely 
provide a cheaper substitute. Hence, generation costs would be unlikely to deviate 
substantially from our default generation cost estimates. For the purposes of the geospatial rollout modelling carried out by the Earth Institute, 
Castalia provided an all-inclusive LRMC of $130/MWh covering the costs of generation, 
transmission and distribution. This was used to evaluate the least cost solution between grid 
and off grid solutions on a whole of life costing basis. This in line with the JICA’s now 
completed “National Electricity Master Plan” in which the equivalent costs across three 
scenarios range from $124/MWh to $128/MWh with a recommended scenario of 
$126/MWh.8

 “The Project for Formulation on the National Electricity Master Plan in the Republic of The Union Of Myanmar -
Draft Final Report”, July 2014, Japan International Cooperation Agency5 Funding (Cost Recovery)
In this section, we consider if the roll-out is financially viable by examining whether all 
costs—including debt service (annual interest and principal repayment)—can be fully funded 
through a combination of consumer tariffs and Government subsidies. 
For any level of tariff, the Government will need to decide whether the overall funding gap 
between the cost of achieving its electrification objectives and the revenue from the current 
tariffs is fiscally sustainable. The funding gap will be reduced if tariffs are increased.
However, the electricity rollout will not succeed if tariffs are unaffordable to the population 
and are not competitive for businesses. Assessing affordability is complex and would best be 
done through a detailed “willingness to pay” survey as well as a detailed survey of household 
expenditure patterns on electricity substitutes in non-electrified households. Further, even 
when informed by such surveys, policy makers, and governments are required to make 
difficult judgments about balancing different needs and objectives.
This report does not recommend any level of tariff. However, it highlights the relationship 
between tariff choices and the fiscal burden on the Government of Myanmar, as measured 
by the funding gap. We also show some international comparisons to provide a broad basis 
for making choices between tariff levels and funding gap (subsidy) levels. 
The figure below summarizes the relationship between tariff levels and the funding gap. At 
one extreme, we show the current tariff of Myanmar. For this chart, we assume that this 
tariff is held constant in real terms—in other words, that the nominal tariff is adjusted each 
year in line with inflation. This tariff produces the highest funding gap, with the present 
value of $2.17 billion. This is greater than the total present value of the capex required for 
the roll-out program to achieve 100% electrification. This is because the current tariff—
while it is sufficient to cover costs in the short term—will not cover the operating costs of 
the new or the old systems in the long run.
At the other extreme, we show the average tariff that would fully cover the system unit costs 
over the next 40 years. Given the existing structure of tariffs, this would require the weighted 
average tariff of $0.084 per kWh, or an average weighted residential tariff of approximately 
$0.05 per kWh.
We note that the Government’s current strategy is to adjust the tariff to ensure that the 
revenues on the existing system cover all cash costs. Even if no roll-out happens, the cash
costs of the existing system will grow as the already connected customers increase their 
demand, and new generation has to be added at LRMC to meet that demand. We estimate 
the average tariff that would be required to keep the current system cash neutral at $0.076 
per kWh. This translates into a weighted average residential tariff of $0.043. In other words, 
the weighted average residential tariff would need to increase from $0.037 to $0.043—a real 
rise of 17% on average over the period—to maintain the “old” system on the cash neutral 
basis. We show this point along the curve.
As an illustration, we also show an approximate funding gap that would result if the current 
tariffs prevalent in Vietnam were used. Vietnam has similar per capita GDP to Myanmar, but 
has a substantially higher electrification ratio. Figure 5.1: Funding Gap Sensitivity to Tariff Levels
Note: Points on the horizontal axis represent the weighted average residential tariff

We look at the level of prices actually paid by residential and business customers in 
neighboring countries with similar levels of income to Myanmar. We show the results for 
residential customers in Figure 5.2, and that of business customers in Figure 5.3. We only 
show the rates for the first block of consumption, both for residential and business 
customers.

constraints, we consider the actual payments made by low usage residential and business 
customers.
All of the countries considered in our brief survey have higher levels of electrification than 
Myanmar, ranging from 31 per cent in Cambodia, to 97 per cent in Vietnam as shown in 
Figure 5.4.
Figure 5.4: Electrification Ratios
Without pre-judging the outcome, we conclude that substantial opportunity exists to increase 
tariffs over time to minimize the size of the funding gap.
5.2 The Reference Case
Our reference case is the continuation of the current policy where the Government aims to 
set tariffs such that the existing YESB and ESE businesses are cash neutral in every year. 
Since demand from consumers on the existing system is growing every year, and requires 
more expensive generation, the policy means that tariffs will need to rise in real terms to 
accommodate the blending-in of more expensive generation. 
We assume tariffs are increased uniformly between the “new system” and the “existing 
system”. This allows us to calculate the level of Government support required for the “new 
system”—the hypothetical standalone “roll-out” business—as long as the existing system is 
made cash neutral. 
The required real tariff increases are presented in Table 5.1 below.

Overall, the current system can be kept cash neutral through a steady and modest real 
increase in tariffs. 
The figure below shows the effect of the reference tariff policy on the present value of the
funding gap. We present the funding gap in present value terms because it allows us to 
capture the effect of tariffs on the recovery of both capital, and operating costs of the 
electricity system. At the given tariff assumptions, the present value of the funding gap 
shown below ($1.069 billion) means that over the long-term, the Union budget will on 
average provide 27.4 percent of all funding for the electricity system. Consumers will provide 
72.6 percent of funding. The total cash-flow burden (including both funding and financing) 
will be shared between the Government of Myanmar (18.6 percent), providers of 
concessional finance (32 percent), and consumers (49.4 percent).

Roll out Scenario
Assumptions: 10% discount rate; time period: 2015-2070; after 2046 revenues, capex and opex are kept at their 
2045 levels The effects of this tariff path on the required Government support in each of the following 
16 years are shown below.
Figure 5.6: Annual Government Support Needed under National Least-Cost Roll-out
5.3 Key Sensitivities
The size of the funding gap depends both on the tariff decisions, and on decisions about 
how to prioritize investments: if the Government does not follow the national least-cost rollout path, the size of the funding gap increases. In addition, the size of the funding gap at any 
particular tariff will be significantly influenced by generation costs and future system loss.
5.3.1 Tariffs Remain Constant in Real Terms
We define this as the case where electricity tariffs remain constant in real terms at their 
current levels (they are assumed to be adjusted for inflation every year).
We also assume that the tariff structure and the pattern of consumption remain unchanged 
throughout the roll-out period. Specifically, we assume that 5% of connections are at the 
current industrial rate of 0.075US$/kWh for the lowest-block consumption, and 95% are at 
the residential rate of 0.035US$/kWh. Furthermore, we conservatively assume that mini-grid 
tariffs are 1.5 times the weighted average of the grid tariffs. The mini-grid tariff assumption 
is based on data provided by the MOEP9. No tariff is assumed to be charged for off-grid 
solar home systems. The tariff assumptions are given below:

Private Distribution Provider in Off-Grid Area Permitted by MOEP, Department of Electricity Planning, MOEP (2014)The present value (PV) of the consumer funding gap at constant real tariffs is given below 
for three connection options. For the national least-cost roll-out scenario, the consumer 
funding gap is the lowest, at US$2.1 billion in present value terms. For the Proportional and 
Targeted connection scenarios, the consumer funding gap is approximately US$2.3 billion in 
present value terms.

Assumptions: 10% discount rate; time period: 2015-2070; after 2046 revenues, capex and opex are kept at their 
2045 levels 
Overall, with constant real tariffs, for every kWh of electricity sold, the roll-out “business” 
loses money. This means that the need for financial support increases over time, as demand 
on this “business” grows. Moreover, this also means that consumers on the existing 
network, as their demand grows, impose losses on the existing YESB and ESE businesses. 
While current tariffs cover the cash costs of existing generation, they do not cover LRMC of 
generation. Hence, at current tariffs, YESB and ESE will lose money for every additional 
kilo-watt-hour consumed by their current customers. 
Assuming tariffs and connection charges do not increase in real terms, the government will 
need to subsidize operating losses, and pay debt service to close the funding gap. We 
define operating balance (surplus or loss) as revenue (electricity tariffs and connection 
charges), minus electricity distribution and transmission opex, minus the cost of energy. 
5.3.2 Zero Funding Gap Tariff
We now consider the opposite extreme: the tariff would remove any need for Government 
support. While such a tariff may be unlikely in the short term, and would probably be 
inefficient since there are significant national benefits from promoting electrification during 
this early phase, this sensitivity allows us to consider the level of effort that may be required 
to eliminate the funding gap. The annual real increase in tariffs required between 2015 and 
2070 is 5.12% per year. 
It is worth noting that with constantly rising tariffs, the hypothetical standalone roll-out 
business will not be cash-flow neutral in every year. In some years, the Government may need to borrow to provide additional support. However, the zero consumer funding gap 
calculation ensures that sufficient revenue is available in years with positive cash-flow to 
repay such additional debt.
To avoid such interim borrowing, we consider what tariffs would be needed for consumer 
revenues to cover operations and debt service in every year. This is shown in Table 5.6
below for the next 10 years.
Table 5.6: Tariffs when New System is Cash Neutral Every Year (In US$)

This table clearly shows the magnitude of the challenge: tariffs would need to jump 
significantly in 2016 and 2017 in real terms to avoid even short term reliance on government 
subsidy. Again, this tariff path would be neither desirable nor efficient.6 Implementation Road Map
Even if financing and funding become available, the institutional capability will remain a 
significant constraint on electrification. 
Given the scale of the electrification challenge and the long time commitment, the NEP 
requires a sector-wide, programmatic approach to accelerate electrification rates in Myanmar. 
In practical terms, this means that all institutions involved in funding, financing, and 
implementing various components of the electrification roll-out must work in a highly 
coordinated and integrated way. Money must flow through the system efficiently and on 
time, it must follow the technical least-cost electrification plan, and the projects which flow 
from that plan must be procured and implemented as efficiently as possible. In other words, 
the success of the NEP depends on more than just making more money available: if that 
money cannot be used in an efficient and timely manner, the NEP objectives will not be 
achieved.
The key features of a sector-wide programmatic approach are:
; Organizing the roll-out around a comprehensive technically least-cost plan for 
grid, mini-grid, and individual household-level connections. In practice, this 
means ensuring that the plan is constantly updated and refined, and that actual 
projects follow the plan, in terms of what, where and when gets built
; Funding flows must be predictable. For the technical plan, there must be a clear
and comprehensive multi-year funding and financing plan. The institutions 
implementing the program must all play their role in ensuring that the flow of 
funds keeps the program moving. This will require a high degree of coordination, 
with direct involvement by key political decision-makers
; The implementation of the plan must be standardised and simplified, so that 
procurement and other necessary activities can be carried out without delay and at 
low transaction costs
; The program must remain focused on the overall results, with clear accountability 
and incentives for performance.
Institutions will play a critical role in shaping how the NEP will be delivered. In particular, 
institutions need to be designed to ensure (i) there are sufficient funds flowing into the 
overall electrification program (ii) there is coordination of the funding, such that it is 
reaching projects which are (iii) prioritized on a least-cost basis, and (iv) projects are being 
built efficiently, and are achieving social objectives. A clear pathway for private sector 
participation within that framework will be necessary to increase the probability of efficient 
implementation.
Few countries have been able to achieve the kind of acceleration in electrification rates that 
Myanmar will need to achieve. Those—such as Rwanda— that have implemented a 
programmatic, sector wide approach. The box below describes how Rwanda implemented its 
electrification roll-out. Rwanda and other countries seeking to accelerate electrification 
provide useful lessons for Myanmar. Our analysis draws on those lessons, but seeks to apply 
them within the specific context of Myanmar’s institutions and fiscal practices.Box 6.1: Programmatic Sector-Wide Approach: Case of Rwanda
In June 2008, Rwanda embarked on a mission to 
accelerate electrification rates using a 
programmatic sector-wide approach. 
Goal: The goal was to increase electrification 
from a mere 6 percent in 2008 to 16 percent by 
2014. This meant they had to make around 37,000 
new connections per year, over in a five year 
period. However they were starting with a growth 
rate in new connections of less than 5000 per 
year. The overall cost of the program was 
estimated at US$336.6 million
Key Features: 
; The program received strong and broad-based support from key players in the 
Government, including the Cabinet, the Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Finance, Ministry 
of Economy, other line Ministries, along with the electricity utilities. Each of these entities 
was held accountable for performing certain actions.
; Rwanda’s sector-wide approach was anchored by an integrated and detailed technical, 
financial, and implementation plan. 
; To ensure efficient and effective program delivery, a National Electrification Program 
Management Department was established within the national distribution utility Electrogaz. 
The functions of this department was to oversee: 
– planning, design, and implementation
– pooling of all funds irrespective of donor
– monitoring and evaluation, and
– reporting accountability.
Results: Overall, the results from this program are positive. 
; Rwanda is on track to achieve its electrification targets as shown by the table below:

Rwanda was one of the first countries to use a programmatic, sector-wide approach. Today 
several countries including Kenya, Uganda, and Ethiopia are following suite.
Source: Castalia Rwanda Electrification Investment Prospectus (2008), Rwanda: Extending Access to Energy, Lessons 
from a Sector Wide Approach, ESMAP, World Bank 2013Our review, undertaken in consultation with the sector stakeholders, finds that Myanmar is 
currently not institutionally equipped to roll out the electrification program on a 
programmatic, sector-wide basis. Myanmar’s existing institutional arrangements are designed 
to support electrification expansion on an ad-hoc project-by-project basis. This means that 
funding from the state and donors—where it is available—would be fragmented and unable 
to reduce the costs and support achievement of the universal electrification objectives.
However, our consultations with the Government have resulted in a high degree of 
understanding and commitment by the Government of Myanmar to implement institutional 
solutions to support the NEP.
In summary, in order to follow a programmatic sector-wide approach and achieve rapid and 
efficient scale up, the following key institutional issues will need to be addressed:
; A mechanism is needed to pull together the various funding and financing
sources, into a coherent and comprehensive program and to ensure that money 
flows in line with the financial plan
; An entity is needed that will take control of the program, and coordinate with the 
various stakeholders. It must be given resources and authority, and be held 
accountable for its outcomes 
; Grid-based electricity provision through the distribution utilities needs to be made 
more efficient in order to scale up. Significant opportunity must be created for 
private sector participation
; Support for the implementation of mini-grids must be coordinated, both to 
achieve the benefits of standardization and to ensure that money follows 
appropriate projects
; The design of the household-level electrification program needs to be made more 
sustainable and efficient.
We have discussed a number of institutional reform options with the Government. We have 
received feedback from the Government of Myanmar on some of the proposals. The 
Government has also made a number of further reform decisions. This section of the report 
presents our diagnostic of the institutional barriers and sets out a Roadmap of specific steps 
required for the successful implementation of the NEP.
6.1 Diagnostic of Institutional Barriers to Implementing the NEP
A systematic and coherent approach to planning, funding, financing, and physically making 
new connections is needed to scale up electrification in Myanmar. In this section we consider 
the barriers to integrating various aspects of electrification into an overall program. We also 
examine barriers to efficient implementation of various components of the program: on-grid, 
mini-grid and individual household-level electrification.
Our analysis is summarized in Figure 6.1 below.Figure 6.1: Summary of Barriers to Achieving Electrification Objectives
6.1.1 Program-level Management and Coordination
Our consultations with stakeholders indicate that at present there is no effective mechanism 
to coordinate funding and financing flows from different streams into a program. 
To begin with, there is currently no institutional structure in Myanmar to coordinate 
decisions about the setting of electricity tariffs and the electrification objective. In order to 
implement a programmatic approach to electrification, it would be necessary to link tariffs to 
the cost of providing and expanding electricity services, as well as to the availability of 
budget funds to subsidize such services. In practice, we understand that the two relevant 
decisions—how high the tariffs should be and how much fiscal resource is available to 
develop the electricity system are taken in isolation from each other. Most importantly, they 
are taken in isolation from any electrification target. 
In effect, the Parliament decides the level of electricity tariff by reference to two primary 
considerations: the political acceptability of the tariff, and the existing cash needs of the 
electricity system. This means that future needs of the expanding system are not taken into 
account. 
The Government separately decides how much capital investment is possible in the sector 
on the basis of its current fiscal constraint, and on the basis of individual project and loan 
proposals that are put before the relevant agencies by various donors and developers. This 
means that the pace of electrification is the residual of such project-by-project and shortterm fiscal considerations, rather than the other way around—where the financial plan is 
developed to achieve stated objectives.
Furthermore, the Government has limited mechanisms to assess and prioritize various 
contributions it makes to the overall sector development. As is often the case, the Ministry 
of Finance has different “vertical” budget approvals for each ministry. Hence, when government spending for various aspects of electrification comes out of different budgets, it 
is difficult to form a comprehensive view of how various activities contribute to the overall 
program, and whether there is a better way to align such activities. This is further 
complicated by the role, that has now been given to Regional and State Governments, to 
promote electrification at the local level. Since Union and Regional Government budgets are 
formed separately, and since there are barriers to coordination between Regional and Union 
budgets (for example, Union funding has to be spent via Union-level procurement agencies
and cannot be channelled to locally implemented projects), there is considerable risk that 
local and Union-level electrification projects could be at cross-purposes to each other.
At present, the Ministry of Electric Power (MOEP) takes primary responsibility for planning 
the national grid expansion and rehabilitation. MOEP is cooperating with the World Bank 
Group and its consultants in the development of the initial least-cost electrification plan. 
However, while MOEP is able to provide such technical cooperation, it has no institutional 
basis to serve as the agency that would be able to administer the least-cost sector-wide rollout plan. MOEP may be able to develop the institutional capability to review, manage, and 
update the on-grid aspects of the roll-out plan, but it would not have the authority to 
coordinate between on-grid and mini-grid projects, and to allocate funds to mini-grid 
projects.
In principle, the Ministry of Finance has the authority to coordinate the financial flows 
between different budget streams, but of course, the Ministry of Finance does not, and will 
not, have the technical expertise to manage the least-cost electrification plan. In other words, 
what is missing is the crucial link between the technical planning process, the link to 
electrification objectives and authority to manage the flow of funds in accordance with the 
plan that would achieve those objectives.
The existing mechanism for bringing together the activities of different agencies is through 
ministerial coordination committees. However, such committees may not be suited to 
achieving the required sector-wide coordination. In Myanmar, ministerial committees bring 
together ministries with their existing budgets and priorities. They do not serve as a tool for 
re-prioritising budgets. By contrast, sector-wide coordination of the electrification roll-out 
will require ability to make decisions about prioritizing between on-grid and mini-grid 
developments, and to manage the flow of funds in line with the constantly updated least-cost 
roll-out plan. 
A further complication is that the existing mechanism for the approval of external loans—
through a further ministerial committee (National Foreign Aid Committee)—may impose an 
additional level of separation between the least-cost electrification plan and the financial plan 
that must sit behind it. The current approval process is by its nature based on project-byproject appraisal, and does not fit easily with the programmatic approach.
Overall, the existing institutions are geared towards a project-by-project review, approval,
and implementation. This needs to be turned around towards an institutional model which 
enables to support programmatic, sector-wide implementation. This will require integrating 
responsibility for technical planning with the responsibility for managing a financial plan that 
supports the overall objective, ensuring that funds flow to projects identified by the leastcost plan at the rate able to support the agreed electrification target.6.1.2 Efficient Operation of Utilities and their Ability to Scale-up
The geospatial analysis shows that the majority of electrification in Myanmar will occur 
through extending the existing national grid. Hence, the bulk of the electrification effort will 
fall to the two on-grid utilities: ESE and YESB. 
However, our review suggests that it is unlikely that the two utilities would be able to 
successfully fulfil this responsibility under the current institutional setting. Even if funding 
and financing become available, to achieve higher rates of electrification, the two utilities will 
need to recruit additional staff and improve their operating efficiencies. In our view, this is 
unlikely to be achieved under their current structures as Government trading entities. 
The key problems facing Government trading entities in Myanmar are:
; Limited operational flexibility and ability to plan. We understand that the 
Government of Myanmar is seeking to provide greater flexibility to its trading 
entities. However, our review of the Accounting Policies for State-Owned 
Enterprises (2012), as well as discussions with stakeholders, indicates that there is 
little ability for such enterprises to make their own commercial decisions. Key 
spending decisions require inclusion in the Union budget, while staff policies have 
to be coordinated with the remainder of the public sector. While such enterprises 
will have some ability to access finance via the Government owned development 
banks, they will not have the freedom to manage their balance sheets in line with 
their medium-term objectives
; Limited performance incentives. State-owned enterprises effectively remain 
budget implementation agencies, rather than commercial organizations 
incentivized to minimize their costs and to maximize their sales to their customers 
in order to maximize profits
; No ability to access finance on own balance sheet. Apart from limited access 
to public sector loans, ESE and YESB will not be able to arrange finance from 
alternative sources. In effect, they have to serve as passive recipients of the 
available finance. This means that they are not able to set their own pace of 
development.
In addition, there is currently no instrument for setting cost-reflective tariffs, and for making 
rational decisions about the incidence of subsidy. Parliamentary approval of tariffs creates 
on-going uncertainty for the utilities, and means that they cannot provide credible multi-year 
promises to their suppliers or potential lenders. As a result, ESE and YESB either have to 
enter into short-term, high-risk arrangements, or require the Government to stand behind 
every long-term contract (such as IPP contracts). In practice, this means that electrification 
can only proceed at the pace of the slowest component in the chain—the Government’s 
ability to review and provide support to the utilities’ various initiatives.
It is important to emphasize that—given their financial and institutional constraints—there 
are many things that YESB and ESE do well. We have been impressed with the orderly 
management of the fiscal constraint and the existing process to prioritize individual projects 
against this fiscal constraint. We have also been impressed by the attempts to bring in the 
private and commercial sectors into the electricity sector. Much of the network build is 
already outsourced to the private sector. In addition, ESE and YESB have entered into 
contracts with private companies for the management of the electricity network in a few townships, beginning in 2012. We have reviewed one such contract, and it appears to be a 
form of system-loss reduction contract—where the private entity earns profits from 
undertaking investments that would reduce system loss and increase local capacity. However, 
this contract does not draw on the existing international best practice, and is unlikely to 
provide a basis for a strategic role for the private sector to participate in the efficient 
implementation of the NEP.
Overall, we believe that an increase in funding flows would enable ESE and YESB to 
increase the rate of connection to some extent. But, without institutional reform that would 
promote operational flexibility, medium-term decision-making, and strong performance 
incentives, the ability to scale up without blowing out costs would be limited.
6.1.3 Need for Coordinated Implementation of Mini-grids
At present, there is no coordinated mechanism for the implementation of mini-grids. 10
Regional Governments and private entities are free to come up with ideas for mini-grids. 
International donors are also interested in supporting mini-grid projects at the village level, 
particularly those built around local renewable generation sources. However, this “bottom 
up” ability to promote projects is different from the required ability to implement mini-grid 
projects in line with the least-cost electrification plan. At present, there is significant risk that 
individual mini-grid proposals may not conform to the least cost plan.
In addition, there is no standard format or process for developing mini-grids. This means 
that every project effectively has to “re-invent the wheel”: come up with its own institutional 
design, technical plans, legal documentation, and financial proposals. Since mini-grids are by 
definition relatively small projects, this means that the transactions costs—the costs of 
getting the mini-grid organized—can be a very high proportion of the total cost. Such 
transactions costs will reduce the number of projects that can proceed.
Finally, there is no ministry “ownership” for mini-grids. Ministry of Electric Power (MOEP) 
is focused on the national grid, while Department of Rural Development (DRD), housed 
within the Ministry of Livestock, Fisheries and Rural Development (MLFRD) deals with 
household-level electrification. In effect, this means that there is no instrument for 
channelling the Union budget to mini-grids or for integrating mini-grids into a 
comprehensive program. At present, proponents of mini-grid ideas have to seek financial 
support directly from donors or other interested parties. Again, this is complicated, costly 
and can only underpin a limited number of projects. 
It is important to emphasise that mini-grid solutions may become particularly important for 
pre-electrification. Hence, the process for enabling mini-grid investment must also involve 
clear transition to future grid connection.
6.1.4 Sustainability and Efficiency of Individual Household Solutions
The Government is currently implementing a household-level solar electrification program 
through DRD. Under this program, DRD has private service providers installing village-level 
solar home systems (SHS), and providing training to local people for the exploitation of the 
system. We were impressed by the enthusiasm and commitment of the staff of DRD. We are 
also conscious that the household-level program will be a small part of the overall 
 
10 Definition of Isolated mini-grids: These are small scale distribution networks typically operating below 11 kilovolts (kV) 
that provide power to one or more local communities and produce electricity from small generators using fossil fuels, 
renewable fuels, or a combination of the two electrification roll-out. However, we believe that the program can be improved in a number 
of ways:
; The standard of electricity service delivered by the program needs to be carefully 
reviewed against the national electrification objective. We are concerned that a 
village may be considered to be electrified after receiving solar systems that are 
only capable of providing lighting, and hence may fall out of the national 
electrification roll-out that would have delivered electricity that could support 
economic development
; The provision of the household-level systems needs to be linked to the least-cost 
electrification plan: such units should be targeted at areas slated for householdlevel electrification in the plan
; The implementation of the program needs to ensure incentives for on-going 
maintenance of the system.
Again, the scale of the household program may be influenced by the size of the preelectrification effort, and will require coordination with the arrival of the grid.
6.2 Program Coordination
The Government has now confirmed that the responsibility for electrification will not be 
centralized in a single Ministry. Rather, the responsibility will remain shared across various 
Ministries, including, Ministry of Electric Power, Ministry for Livestock, Fisheries and Rural 
Development (MLFRD), as well as Regional and State Governments.
Hence, a coordination body needs to be created and provided with sufficient resources and 
sufficient “political pull” to ensure that the coordination task is achieved. We recommend 
that the Government of Myanmar:
; Designate a single coordination committee to oversee all aspects of the 
electrification roll-out. Since successful implementation of the NEP goes beyond 
the strict confines of rural electrification, we suggest that NEMC should have the 
oversight role
; Establish a well-resourced Executive Secretariat to undertake the coordination 
function. This Secretariat would need to report directly to a senior political figure 
(for example, the Vice President or the President) and have the authority to 
oversee the functioning of the NEMC. In addition, it should be able to work 
directly with all relevant agencies (such as MOEP, MLFRD etc). As we discuss 
later, Myanmar’s development partners should consider providing substantial 
technical assistance funding to support this Secretariat.
The Executive Secretariat should perform a number of roles:
; It would maintain and update the geospatial and financial plans for the NEP, and 
monitor the achievement of the electrification targets
; It would serve as the main point of contact for Myanmar’s development partners 
and would advise the Government on managing a coherent financing program for 
the sector-wide plan; It would provide advice and support to the Ministries involved in implementing 
the aspects of the NEP they will be responsible for.
We understand that the Government is considering setting up an independent regulator to 
determine electricity tariffs in Myanmar. This is an essential reform. However, it may take 
time to implement. In order for the NEP roll-out to begin, YESB, ESE and potential private 
operators will require certainty about tariffs and subsidies in order to access financing.
We suggest that while the regulator is being established, the Executive Secretariat should 
take on the responsibility for:
; Reviewing and updating the estimates of the total funding requirement for the 
next five years
; Advising the Government on tariff options and the implications for the subsidy 
requirement
; Coordinating timely delivery of the required subsidy. 
6.3 Grid Connections in YESB Franchise Area
The Government is considering the idea of corporatizing YESB, and is working with the 
International Finance Corporation to develop an investment program for YESB.
We suggest that in addition to the work already under way and in anticipation of the results 
of such work, the Government move quickly to change the way it provides support to 
investment by YESB. At present, YESB applies for budget funds for its investment needs. 
Once the funding is disbursed, there is no obligation on YESB to return that capital. Such 
capital provided by the Union Budget does not count towards the costs of the YESB 
business, and hence is not recovered in tariff.
We suggest that the Government’s objective should be to provide sufficient certainty to 
YESB to enable it to access financing for investment. This can be achieved by:
; Calculating an appropriate cost of service for YESB, including the cost of power 
purchases and the return on and of distribution capital
; Determining how much of that cost will be recovered through tariffs, and
; Providing the balance through an annual subsidy payment.
There are many precedents for this approach. In Indonesia, the Government provides an 
annual Public Service Obligation (PSO) subsidy to the national power company (PLN) such 
that it earns a target rate of return through a combination of tariff revenue and the PSO. 
This enables PLN to borrow, and enter long-term power purchase contracts. Similar 
arrangements exist in various Indian states, where State Governments provide subsidies to 
local distribution companies.
In the medium term, it will be the role of the regulator to set the Annual Revenue 
Requirement (ARR) for the distribution enterprises. In the short term, this function can be 
performed by the Executive Secretariat.
6.4 Grid Connections in the ESE Franchise Area
The majority of new connections in Myanmar will occur in the ESE franchise area. In our 
view, Myanmar has no option but to implement a “conventional” utility reform program. This involves first corporatizing the utilities—ESE and YESB—so that they operate as 
independent commercial entities under a commercially skilled board, are able to conduct 
financing operations on their own balance sheet, and are able to make independent decisions 
about staffing levels, pay, and other resources. Under the corporatized structure, the utility’s 
performance is judged by its ability to earn a return on capital, with the Board and 
management being rewarded for commercial performance in the same way as would occur in 
the private sector. Successful corporatization programs result in reduction of political 
involvement in the operation of utilities: utilities invest and hire because it advances their 
commercial objectives, not to achieve political objectives such as employment. 
We describe this reform program as “conventional” because this has been the path followed 
around the world. While the speed of reform may differ from country to country—and the 
performance of corporatized utilities also differs—the overall approach is no longer seen as 
controversial.
An essential component of the “conventional” utility reform program is the creation of a 
utility regulatory regime which ensures that tariffs are linked to cost (after allowance for any 
subsidies from the Government). There are two reasons for such a regime. First, it helps to 
“de-politicize” the tariff setting process, and provides both the corporatized entity, and any 
private investors and lenders with greater certainty about the level of tariffs. Second, it 
ensures that the management and Board of the corporatized utility cannot meet their 
financial performance objectives through the exploitation of monopoly power, rather than 
through efficient operation of the utility. By ensuring that the tariffs are set so that the utility 
is only able to recover reasonably efficient costs, including the weighted average cost of 
capital, a regulatory regime also ensures that strong financial performance by the utility is 
only possible if it operates efficiently.
There are numerous models for implementing a utility regulatory regime. These range from 
the establishment of an independent utility regulator, which would be able to undertake 
periodic reviews of cost reflective tariffs and set such tariffs without interference from the 
political process, to the setting of tariff formulas in contract between the Government and 
the utility.
A further reform step of splitting the corporatized ESE into smaller state and region based 
distribution enterprises could also be considered in the longer term. Smaller regional entities 
might be more nimble and responsive, as load growth dramatically increases with the 
expansion program. Introducing a layer of competition between these distribution 
companies might also improve operational efficiency.
Relatedly, the option of strategically involving private sector should also be considered. The 
level of private sector involvement may range from system loss reduction contracts, to 
management contracts to full concession for utilities. The best approach will depend, in part, 
on incidence of subsidy and the optimal number of utilities across the country. There are 
many examples of high quality private sector participation contracts around the world. 
We understand that the Government is already considering reform options for ESE and 
YESB. While the detail of utility reform is outside the scope of this report, it is clear that 
NEP would not be able to proceed without significant and rapid progress on such reform. 
However, we realize that reform may take time, and that the electrification program cannot 
wait for the completion of the reform program. With this in mind, we would suggest a number of measures that could improve operational efficiency and flexibility of the utilities 
in the short-term, and enable first steps towards scaling up of electrification. These include:
; Developing a five-year budget for ESE and YESB in line with the electrification 
plan, so that the utilities can commence medium-term planning
; Provide ESE and YESB with the flexibility to hire staff on short-term contracts 
to enable more rapid expansion
; Announce the five-year plan as quickly as possible, so that private sector 
providers can start gearing up for the expected contracts, and in particular, start 
training personnel with the necessary skills
; Pending the creation of the regulatory regime, develop and announce a five-year 
tariff path consistent with the electrification plan and with a realistic assessment 
of consumers’ ability and willingness to pay.
Finally, we recommend that new connections should be included on the utilities’ balance 
sheet, and financed as part of the overall program, rather than requiring consumers to fund 
the entire connection or to use their own sources of finance to finance it. This would enable 
concessional financing to be used for the cost of connections and remove a significant 
barrier to electrification.
Some of these connections will be carried out by ESE itself. However, it is likely that many 
connections can be managed by private and community enterprises that will receive a 
concession for a sub-franchise. For example, we have been informed that MLFRD is 
considering setting up a state enterprise under the Ministry to implement the roll-out in 
selected priority rural areas. This enterprise will receive a sub-franchise from ESE to make 
low voltage (LV) connections in those areas, to connect to the ESE MV network, to collect 
tariffs, and to maintain the LV network. We understand MLFRD is considering bidding out 
the operation of this enterprise as a public-private partnership (PPP).
We expect there will be many similar examples and opportunities. To ensure orderly process 
of establishing and implementing such sub-franchises, it will be necessary to:
; Make arrangements for a clear delineation of service areas and responsibilities
; Ensure that ESE receives wheeling payments for its MV investments that serve 
such sub-franchises
; Create a mechanism to enable operators of such sub-franchises (whether private 
or community-owned) to access appropriate financing
; Create a mechanism for delivering subsidies to these operators where such 
subsidies are required.
The figure below summarizes the structures that will need to be put in place to enable subfranchising. Figure 6.2: Private and Community Operators on the ESE Franchise
We discuss the implementation issues for the ESE and for sub-franchises separately.
6.4.1 ESE
Unlike YESB, there is no work at present to examine the corporatization of ESE. We 
recommend that the Government implement similar reforms for both utilities:
; Examine corporatization and investment options for ESE
; Change the structure of support provided to ESE from disbursement of funding 
for investment to ensuring adequate funding to enable ESE to access financing
; Enable ESE to borrow on its balance sheet, including on-lending to ESE donor 
financing
; Use the Executive Secretariat to examine the ESE cost of service, and to 
determine the required subsidy for any level of tariff. 
6.4.2 Sub-Franchise Concessions
The Government should encourage concessions for various sub-franchises. This will greatly 
speed the roll-out and will lead to lower costs. However, it is essential that the process for 
sub-franchising be orderly, and that it should encourage competitive procurement:
; The MOEP, as the Ministry responsible for ESE, should develop clear rules and 
standard application forms for a sub-franchise. Such rules should specify the 
responsibilities of the sub-franchisee (including the obligation to serve the entire 
Electrification Roll Out 
Program

Financing
Customer payments

Sectorpopulation in the area), define the boundaries between the sub-franchise and ESE 
as well as other sub-franchises, and set the wheeling charges to be paid by the 
sub-franchises depending on the extent of its reliance on the ESE’s MV network
; MOEP, with advice from the Executive Secretariat, should set the tariff rules and 
the starting tariff for the sub-franchise
; Sub-franchises should be allocated to operators on the basis of least subsidy (See 
Appendix A on the Chilean Model). In some cases, it should be possible to 
conduct competitive tenders: for example, MLFRD should conduct a competitive 
tender for minimum subsidy for its proposed PPP for rural electrification in the 
priority areas. Similarly, if ESE designates an area as a potential sub-franchise, it 
should be bid out on the basis of minimum subsidy.
However, in many cases, a competitive tender may not be possible: a subfranchise proposal may come from a community or from a local entrepreneur, 
who would have put considerable effort into developing a proposal and may be 
the only party able to take the lead. It would be undesirable to discourage such 
innovation by forcing those who show such initiative to go through a standard 
open tender. Rather, we propose that the Government implement an approach 
known as the “Swiss Challenge”: the party that develops a sub-franchise proposal 
should determine the subsidy that it will require. The draft agreement should then 
be opened to challenge by third parties, who may offer to implement it for a 
lower subsidy. The original proponent should then be given an opportunity to 
match the lowest subsidy bid. If the local proposal genuinely cannot be replicated, 
no challenges will be received. 
MOEP, together with the Executive Secretariat, should ensure that the total subsidy 
envisaged for the roll-out program includes subsidies provided to sub-franchises.
In addition to ensuring an orderly and competitive process, and delivering the required 
subsidies, the operators of sub-franchises will also need to be provided with access to 
finance. Since the initial roll-out program is based on 100% financing through concessional
sources, there will be a need for a mechanism to enable on-lending of concessional finance 
to such private and community operators.
We have conducted initial due diligence on a number of banks in Myanmar that may be able 
to implement such an on-lending program. We had discussions with the Myanmar 
Investment and Commercial Bank (MICB), the Myanmar Rural Development Bank (RDB) 
and the Myanmar Economic Bank (MEB). Of the three state-owned banks, MICB has most 
experience of working with private investors and of providing some project based finance. 
However, even MICB has very limited capabilities and would require considerable technical 
assistance to become an effective project finance lender. At present MICB mainly lends on 1 
and 2 year terms, and most of its lending is against real estate collateral. MICB has offices in 
Yangon and Mandalay, and has a loan book of about $440 million.
At present, the Rural Development Bank also only has branches in Yangon and Mandalay, 
but intends to open a branch in every state in the next year, and will aim eventually to have 
branches in the 330 townships where the MLFRD has an office. RDB has only been in 
existence for just over a year, and so far has operated largely as a kind of micro-finance 
institution for seasonal financing of farming. Its total loan book is US$36 million, of which US$35 million is rural overdrafts. RDB currently has lower capability to manage relatively 
sophisticated and complicated infrastructure deals than MICB, and will need considerably 
more capacity building.
Myanmar Economic Bank is the biggest of the three state-owned banks we examined. Its 
total loan book is US$1.5 billion, and it has divisions dealing with different economic 
sectors, including a loans and supervision department for energy enterprises. ESE and YESB 
have their accounts with MEB. MEB also has previous experience in administering two step 
loans from International Finance Institutions (ADB), and is currently negotiating a two-step 
loan program to be supported by JICA. 
We recommend that Myanmar’s development partners set aside a part of the financing to be 
provided to the electrification program to be delivered via a selected state-owned bank to 
private and community-based operators of sub-franchises. We further recommend that 
development partners undertake detailed due diligence on the state-owned banks and present 
a proposal for negotiations.
A two-step loan program will require technical assistance to the selected bank to enable it to 
understand and manage credit risks associated with long-term electricity distribution 
investments.
6.5 Mini-Grid Connections
We have reviewed a number of approaches that involve primary reliance on local initiatives 
for mini-grids, giving the Union Government a support role through standard-form funding 
and financing programs, as well as enforcing baseline performance through standard 
contracts. Chile, and more recently Mali provide examples of such more decentralized 
approaches. Relevant experience of these countries is described in Appendix A.
The table below summarizes how these successful models can be adapted to Myanmar.

will be needed
While permanent mini-grids will play a minor role in the electrification program, there may 
be numerous “pre-electrification” mini-grids. In essence, community groups and private 
investors may decide an opportunity to electrify an area well ahead of the time when it is 
feasible to extend the MV lines to that area. However, there is no reason why it would not be 
feasible to install grid-ready LV lines in that area, and to use local generation until the grid 
arrives. In many cases, local generation will be temporary in nature. It will either need to be 
amortized in the period before the grid arrives, or it needs to have some second-hand value 
and be able to be moved elsewhere. For example, diesel generator sets clearly fall into that 
category.
There will also be many cases when local generation is more permanent in nature: mini 
hydro or other local renewable power sources could provide a basis for mini-grids. Such 
renewable generation will be more costly than large scale thermal or hydro-based generation 
operating on the grid. Hence, arrangements will need to be put in place to enable some of 
the cost of such generation to be amortized prior to the mini-grid joining with the grid, or to 
provide subsidies for such generation to make it competitive with the rest of the grid. The 
International Finance Corporation is currently providing advice to the Government on the 
models that can be adopted in such circumstances. There are a number of useful models that 
have been trialed in other countries.
From the perspective of the implementation of the NEP, the issues around the development 
of mini-grids (whether temporary or permanent) are similar to the sub-franchising of the 
ESE areas. In particular there is the need to:
; Provide standard processes and standard documentation which sets out the 
obligations of the operator
; Provide a competitive (minimum subsidy) process, or a “Swiss challenge” where 
the proposal is in response to a local initiative, against predictable tariff rules
; Ensure timely delivery of the subsidy
; Enable the operator to access concessional finance.
We suggest that given the similarities in the issues, the solutions should also be similar. In 
fact, we would recommend that a single set of rules be applied to sub-franchising of grid 
connections and to mini-grids, since the main factor differentiating the two is likely to be the 
timing of when the grid connection occurs. A mini-grid operator will need to know what 
wheeling charges it will need to pay to ESE once the grid arrives, as well as have an orderly 
process for managing its generation assets. 6.6 Household Electrification
Beginning in 2012, the DRD has used donor funds and Union budget to develop a nascent 
solar initiative that provides free Solar Home Systems (SHS) to households mainly in rural 
areas, provided they meet certain broad criteria. 
Household-level solutions will be least cost or pre-electrification solutions for the more 
isolated, relatively small settlements. Hence, in addition to scaling up grid and mini-grid 
connections, it will be important to scale up the household-level initiative. 
There are four main ways to improve sustainability and efficiency of the household-level 
program:
; The program must be backed by predictable sources of financing and funding
; The program must generate revenues that would contribute to on-going costs and 
be financially sustainable
; The program must be designed to ensure that once installed, the systems continue 
to provide quality service
; The program must be well targeted to areas where SHS based solutions are the 
most economic electrification option.
Several countries, including Myanmar’s direct neighbors—Lao PDR and Bangladesh—have 
implemented large-scale solar programs and have achieved some success. We describe their 
experience in Appendix A. Here we consider the implications for Myanmar.
Institutional Options and Recommendations for Scaling up Household-level 
Solutions
We recommend that DRD:
; Provide financial incentives that promote cost-recovering business models 
to flourish. Given the high upfront cost of SHS, some form of concessional 
financing and/or funding is essential for scale-up. The Government must clearly 
specify the types and amount of financial incentives available. Financial incentives 
could include initial capital subsidies and various types of concessional loans. 
Additionally, the Government must establish clear criteria for which entities are 
eligible for receiving the financial incentives. This would help improve the 
targeting of the program. The incidence of the financial incentives could be on 
the product suppliers, project companies or service companies, technicians, endusers, and the community
; Provide clear guidelines and rules for the entities that will benefit from the 
financial incentives. For example if the financial incentive is concessional loans 
to end customers, the program design should include streamlined loan application 
procedures and flexible arrangements for securing and repaying loans. Loan 
officers must be familiar with the system in order to facilitate and accelerate loan 
processing. Similarly, if a product supplier needs a license to supply to the market, 
the licensing procedure should be clear and simple
; Encourage scaling up in areas where SHS is economical. The economic 
niche for solar home systems covers remote or isolated areas where loads and 
load densities are low, and where grid based solutions are not cost justified. The Government entity promoting this program should have a clear idea where these 
areas are, and prioritize them by targeting financial resources to those areas. 
Knowing these areas would require being well acquainted with the updated 
geospatial rollout plan. In such areas, the Government can provide additional 
technical support, fully fund feasibility studies and surveys, and devise educational
and marketing campaigns
; Ensure close coordination between the grid roll-out and the SHS program. 
International experience shows that the usefulness of temporary SHS solutions 
depends on the timing of grid extension. For example, Laos found that more than 
one third of the systems were retrieved in less than two years after installation due 
to the arrival of the grid 
; Provide training support and incentives to ensure sufficient and well 
trained technicians. Well-trained technicians are needed to install, maintain, and 
repair SHS. While some users can perform simple maintenance procedures, 
trained technicians are still required after installation, since experience has shown 
that in the long term, reliance on users for maintenance can impair the 
performance of SHS. The Government can provide centers of excellence for 
training or additional incentives to become a technician
; Closely monitor the program’s progress. It is also very crucial for the
Government entity directing the program to ensure the scale up is progressing 
according to plan. They should do this by collecting information and then being 
proactive about making improvements program delivery as lessons are being 
learned.
DRD has already developed some expertise in SHS, and its staff display impressive 
enthusiasm for their program. Providing technical assistance to DRD to develop its program 
in line with international experience, while ensuring that funding and financing available to 
the program was in line with the NEP, would allow for the scale up of the household-level 
component of the NEP. 
Overall, the Government needs to move the household electrification program from the 
relatively unsustainable give-away of solar systems, to an arrangement where customers are 
provided with energy supply by firms that maintain and operate household and village 
systems. Customers would pay for the energy they receive. Private providers would use 
revenue to cover the costs of maintenance. The Government would provide subsidies to 
ensure that tariff revenues were sufficient to cover the costs of the private operator. Such a 
shift will be particularly important to support the “pre-electrification” program.7 Technical Assistance for Myanmar National 
Electrification Plan (NEP)
Implementation of the National Electricity Electrification Plan is a complex and challenging 
undertaking, which is more difficult than the “business as usual” rate of new connections 
currently undertaken by the policy and implementation institutions in Myanmar. Technical 
and administrative capacity will be a major constraint on the roll out.
The challenge will be particularly acute in rural areas as ESE will be required to increase its 
rate of connections from around 60,000 per year, to more than 500,000 per year to achieve 
the goal of 100% electrification by 2030. 
A further challenge will be managing the influx of substantial donor funds through 
concessional loans. Coordinating funding, meeting the needs and requirements of a number 
of donor agencies, and ensuring that the electrification program meets its targets represents a 
large scale and complex administrative and project management task. This task is
significantly in excess of the current roles and experience of the major institutions involved 
in the electrification rollout. 
It is clear that successful implementation will require a major Technical Assistance program. 
In this section we detail:
; The institutions that will be involved
; The tasks that will require TA; and
; An estimate of the scale of TA required. 
We estimate the total amount of TA required over the next five years to support the 
distribution rollout as $23.8 million as shown in Table 7.1.

Executive Secretariat 288 $30,000 $8.460,000

Banking Sector 144 $30,000 $4,320,000
Total 792 $30,000 $23,760,000
For this estimate, we use a blended international rate of $30,000 per month, which includes 
all international advisor costs and local technical support.

institution
; The Electricity Supply Enterprise (ESE) and the Yangon Electricity Supply Board 
(YESB) as the key implementing agencies
; The banking sector as it will have a key role providing finance to private sector 
service providers—particularly for mini grid and household solar systems.
We explain their TA requirements below.
The Role of the Executive Secretariat
We previously outlined the need for effective sector-wide coordination, and for the 
responsibility for electrification not to be centralized to a single Ministry. We recommended 
that the Government of Myanmar establish a well-resourced Executive Secretariat to 
coordinate the program. Technical Assistance will be needed in the following areas:
; Maintaining and updating the geospatial and financial plans for the NEP, 
monitoring the achievement of the electrification targets and modifying and 
updating the Plan over time, and incorporating learning’s from progress. This a 
complex technical task, as well as a complex policy task 
; Managing a coherent financing and funding program for the sector-wide plan, 
including liaison with donor agencies and the Department of Finance. This will 
involve meeting the financial control requirements of the donor agencies, and 
appropriate disbursement of funds to the implementing agencies and banks; and 
; Help support and coordinate the MOEP and DRD policies that underpin the 
aspects of the NEP they have policy responsibility
The Executive Secretariat will be the Project Management Office for the Plan. Substantial 
TA will be required to establish the PMO and its functions, and recruit and train staff. There 
will also be a need for appropriate systems, policies and administrative procedures. 
Interim roles for the Executive Secretariat
While we recommend that the Government de-politicize the setting of electricity tariffs by 
establishing an independent regulator to determine electricity tariffs, this will take time to 
implement. In order for the NEP roll-out to begin, it is likely that donor agencies as well as 
private sector service providers will require some certainty about tariffs and subsidies in 
order to access financing. While the regulator is being established, we recommend that the 
Secretariat take on the role as a regulator in the short run. They will require TA to undertake 
this role. The TA will fund:
; A full sector wide cost of service study taking into account current generation, 
transmission and distribution infrastructure, as well as the additional investment required to support the rollout and load growth on the existing system. This study 
will determine the current level of cost reflectivity of existing tariffs
; A detailed tariff study focusing on the appropriate form and structure of tariffs to 
promote cost reflectivity and economic efficiency. A significant aspect will be the 
extent to which tariff cross subsidies—for example from business and industrial 
customers to residential customers—while lessening subsidy requirements may 
inhibit economic development and expansion by industry
; A subsidy design program that will provide estimates of the total funding 
requirement for the medium to long term, and a subsidy mechanism that is 
appropriately targeted and at a level that will be sustainable for the Government 
of Myanmar. The subsidy program should outline the medium to long term path 
to cost reflectivity. 
Assisting Department of Rural Development and Ministry of Electric Power with 
Sub-Franchise Procurement
Encouraging concessions for various sub-franchises will greatly speed the roll-out, and will 
lead to lower costs. It is essential for DRD and MOEP to ensure that the process of subfranchising be orderly and should encourage competitive procurement. It is likely that these 
sub-franchises may be most appropriate in rural areas and in States, where electrification 
rates are low and ESE has minimal resources and infrastructure.
TA will be required to help DRD and MOEP develop clear rules and standard processes for 
potential sub-franchises. The rules will need to specify the responsibilities of the subfranchisee (including the obligation to serve the entire population in the area), define the 
boundaries between the sub-franchise and YESB or ESE as well as other sub-franchises, and 
set the wheeling charges to be paid by the sub-franchises depending on the extent of its 
reliance on the ESE’s MV network. A TA program will be required not only to develop the 
rules, but to co-ordinate the sub franchise initiative in conjunction with the Secretariat, 
MOEP, and YESB and ESE. 
There will also likely be a need for TA to set up a competitive process for these subfranchises. Under such a tender process, potential sub-franchises will bid the minimum 
subsidy.
Up-skilling the Capabilities of YESB and ESE
The needs of YESB and ESE as the key service delivery agencies for the rollout are 
somewhat different in scale. For YESB, the Yangon region already has a high level of 
electrification—almost 70 per cent—and is already achieving a high rate of connections—
approximately 120,000 per year. Thus at current rates of connection YESB will achieve 
essentially 100 per cent electrification within two years.
By contrast, the majority of new connections required for the remainder of Myanmar will 
occur in the area which ESE oversees. Further, ESE’s current rate annual rate of 60,000 new 
connections per year will have to increase by almost tenfold to around 500,000 per year.
This means that there is a greater need to focus on ensuring that ESE has the technical and 
institutional capabilities to carry out its responsibilities of the roll-out than YESB. 
That capability will need to be enhanced in three key areas:; Planning and financial control—particularly ESE will require a large scale up 
skilling of its planning and project management capabilities both at a head office 
and regional level, as the scale of their construction activities expands almost 
tenfold. It will also require assistance to implement the systems and procedures 
needed to ensure appropriate financial controls
; Procurement—both ESE and YESB will require assistance to implement a 
combined and coordinated procurement program for the materials and equipment 
required for the roll out. Not only will the scale of the procurement be much 
larger than seen in Myanmar, it will also be long term. The fifteen year timescale 
of the rollout means that there will be opportunities and efficiencies in long term 
contracts and relationships for key materials and equipment.
Further, the donor agencies will also have stringent, competitive, and transparent 
procurement requirements as a condition of providing concessional finance
; Training—particularly ESE will require assistance to recruit and train large 
numbers of skilled, and semi-skilled staff. While much of the training will be done 
by ESE itself from its internal resources, it is likely that setting up such large scale 
training will require TA—for example for “train the trainer” programs. In 
addition, the Government (via the utilities or training institutions) could be 
expected to contribute to training for the staff who will be eventually employed 
by private sector service providers. 
Assisting Banks to Lend to Private and Community Enterprises 
Many of the new connections will be made by private and community enterprises. These will 
likely be:
; Sub-franchises to the ESE and YESB grids
; Mini grids—both permanent and pre electrification
; House hold solar systems 
The entities that will provide the infrastructure and connections in these areas will require 
financing from the banking sector.
TA will be needed for banks if they were to set up a two-step loan program such as MEB 
and to understand and manage the credit risks associated with long-term electricity 
distribution investments. 8 Conclusions: Milestones and Accountability
It is clear that looking back on this Roadmap five years from now, its success or failure will 
be judged by the increase in the electrification rate in Myanmar and the overall performance, 
including financial stability of the electricity system. However, looking back a year or two 
from now, how will we know that the Roadmap has been a success?
We suggest the following milestones for the implementation of the Roadmap in the next 12 
months:
; Milestone 1: the Government of Myanmar formally adopt the Roadmap, 
including the institutional implementation plan via a Government Decree
; Milestone 2: The Government appoint an Executive Secretariat tasked with 
coordinating the roll-out program and responsible directly to the Vice-President. 
The Executive Secretariat should be empowered by Decree to act as the single 
window for cooperation with Myanmar’s development partners in relation to the 
roll-out program. While various agencies involved in the roll-out (such as the 
Myanmar International Cooperation Agency being set up by MLFRD as the 
implementation enterprise) will have direct dealings with donors, the Executive 
Secretariat should coordinate the overall financing program, and help align donor 
preferences with the responsibilities of particular agencies
; Milestone 3: the Government of Myanmar commence donor pledging process, 
and continue working with donors to secure the full financing package needed for 
the implementation of the program
; Milestone 4: the Government of Myanmar formally and publically instruct the 
Executive Secretariat to conduct a tariff study (with appropriate technical 
assistance), and to conduct public consultation to improve public understanding 
of the costs of the electricity service and of the required tariff decisions
; Milestone 5: the Government of Myanmar appoint advisors to develop a subfranchising mechanism and standard documentation to facilitate private sector 
participation in the roll-out program
; Milestone 6: the Government of Myanmar make short-term changes to the 
budgeting process for YESB and ESE to facilitate more independent commercial 
decision-making, and to encourage and enable both to borrow on their balance 
sheet. 
We recommend that the Office of the Vice-President should hold the overall accountability 
for the implementation of the NEP, with each Minister being provided with clear 
delegations of responsibility and corresponding accountability.Appendix A: Successful Electrification Case Studies
This appendix describes relevant international experience referred to in Section 6.
Chile’s competitive subsidy program to promote private initiative
Between 1994 and 2000, Chile followed an innovative, relatively decentralized approach to 
incentivizing private distribution companies to develop and operate systems in remote rural 
areas. They did this through creating a competitive subsidy program. This program was 
regarded as successful, achieving 120,000 new connections and contributing to the goal of 
75% rural electrification a year earlier than planned. 
The Chilean National Energy Commission (CNE), a Government entity housed within the 
Ministry for Economy was responsible for allocating yearly funds to Regional Governments 
across the country. For example, the southern regions received more funding since they had 
lower electrification rates. The CNE monitored progress, updated high-level plans and 
targets, and was also responsible for setting performance standards. Regional Governments 
provided one-time capital subsidies to projects proposed by private distribution companies 
that had economic benefits greater than costs, but a financial internal rate of return below a 
predetermined amount. Projects that met both these objective criteria, and had the minimum 
subsidy requirement per new connection were prioritized, until the limited grant funding for 
that year was exhausted. As the program grew, elements of it became standardized. For 
example Regional Governments used standard unit costs to judge the financial and 
economic viability of projects11.
A decentralized approach still involves a significant role for the Government, but that role 
focused more on standard setting and provision of support in response to private initiatives, 
rather than in initiating mini-grid development.
Mali’s mini-grid support program
In practice, there is a continuum between more and less centralized approach—between the 
government taking a more or less leading role in initiating mini-grid projects. Mali provides 
an example of a somewhat mixed role for the government. Today Mali is seen as one of the 
most successful jurisdictions in promoting mini-grids within Africa, with around 60 different 
operators, and the coverage of mini-grids increasing from 1% in 2006 to 12.5% in 2011. 
Mali’s rural energy agency AMADER (Agence Malienne pour le Developpment de l’Energie 
Domestique et de l’Electrification Rurale), supervised by the Ministry of Energy and Water, 
is a corporation with financial autonomy to support rural electrification projects. National 
funds and international funding flows for electrification are routed through AMADER. 
AMADER solicits bids for the electrification of designated high-priority areas—that is those 
with very low electrification rates. It awards a fixed capital subsidy, which has historically 
averaged about $750 per connection, to the private promoter that offers the lowest tariff to 
service the area. This is done because since tariffs for mini-grids are not nationally regulated. 
In areas where there is more competition from promoters, it adds additional criteria, such as 
number of connections made in the first two years, and the lowest subsidy per customer. In

Countries, pg 198-224, Resources for the Future, 2007areas where project developers are hard to come by, AMADER funds feasibility studies, 
does a high-level design of the project and puts it up for bidding12.
Lao PDR’s SHS delivery model
Lao PDR’s SHS program supports business models that emphasize cost-recovery from 
operations and the use of low-cost technology.
A specialist entity, the Off-grid Promotion Support (OGS) Office in the Department of 
Electricity manages and oversees implementation of the SHS program, and other off-grid 
systems, in Lao PDR since 2001.
Private companies, also known as Provincial Energy Service Companies (PESCOs) help to 
plan, organize, install and then provide ongoing support to off-grid schemes in rural areas, 
but in particular SHS. Their mandate and certification criteria were clearly laid out in 2001 by 
the Ministry of Energy.
Following guidelines set out by OGS, the licensed PESCOs identify villages that qualify, 
procure the equipment, and employ Village Energy Managers (VEMs) that are responsible 
for installing the equipment, maintaining it and collecting bills.
PESCOs and VEMs make these systems available to households through hire-purchase 
agreements. Households can make monthly payments over five or 10 years, after which they 
own the systems. This enables households that cannot afford the $300 installation coststo 
acquire SHS, and pay back the costs in US$1 to US$2 monthly repayments. 
These customer payments flow into a revolving fund that finances the costs of installation, 
management, maintenance, and payment collection. Additional grant funding is contributed 
to this revolving fund by donors and the Government. Together this allows for financing of 
additional systems for distribution to new customers.13
Currently, over 19,000 households have been provided with SHS through this program. 
These installations recover their full operational costs, and partial capital costs.
While the program has many successful elements, there are concerns about the complexity 
of the business model. The model involves many players and layers, leading to high overhead 
costs which represent a significant amount of the total cost of the program. The actual 
funds available to the revolving fund for reinvestment are reduced to a smaller amount than 
expected. There is a question about the extent to which high overhead costs are 
compensated by the increased efficiency and sustainability of delivery. Further, while the rate 
of user non-payment is low, the remittance of funds to the revolving fund has been less 
reliable than expected.
Bangladesh’s SHS delivery model
Bangladesh has adopted a more private sector driven approach to SHS promotion than Lao
PDR, which has also been seen as successful. In 1997, the Bangladeshi Government
established the Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL)—an autonomous

of SHS and other renewables, particularly in rural areas.
IDCOL has played a key role in building and expanding the SHS market in Bangladesh by 
establishing SHS product certification, supported by a subsidy incentive plan. 
The Government of Bangladesh finances IDCOL at 3 percent, and acts as a conduit for 
financing by the Asian Development Bank, the German Development Agency (GIZ), the 
Islamic Development Bank, the Global Environment Facility, and the World Bank Group. 
For an SHS bought with a three-year credit with a 15 percent down payment, IDCOL lends 
to the private distributor (POs) 80 percent of the amount borrowed at 6 to 8 percent over 7 
to 10 years, with a one-to-two-year grace period. 
Using this capital, firms that are approved as suppliers of products with IDCOL’s technical 
specifications on-lend to customers at an annual interest rate equivalent to 15 percent. In 
addition to providing the system, these firms are also expected to develop a robust market 
chain for SHS systems so that it sustains beyond the period of intervention by IDCOL.

1.9 million households in rural areas have been electrified through this program as of 2013.15
The Right Institutional Choice: Thailand’s Remarkable Grid-based Electrification 
Expansion Program
Plans for Thailand’s grid based rural electrification began in 1972, when a mere 10 percent of 
people living outside Bangkok had electricity. Thirty years later, more than 99 percent of 
Thailand’s villages were electrified. 
The general idea behind the dramatically successful electrification program was to target 
villages with the lowest costs and highest demand for electricity, that would set a sound 
financial base for future expansion in more remote areas. The electrification efforts were led 
and managed by the Provincial Electrification Authority (PEA), an autonomous 
Government agency responsible for electricity distribution, with complete control over 
budget and program implementation. 
PEA’s ability to solely focus on areas outside metropolitan areas, and incentives to manage 
costs were major factors in the program’s success. The PEA adopted a number of innovative 
and practical strategies to remain financially sound, and remain highly efficient throughout 
the electrification period:
; To avoid political interference the PEA developed a methodology for village 
selection. It allocated villages through an analysis of their socioeconomic 
conditions, and predicted the level of electricity use for households that did not 
have electricity at the time
; To minimize system construction costs, the PEA instituted a far-reaching policy 
of system standardization, including technical, equipment and other components

Systems: An Analysis from Bangladesh,” World Bank Research Pape,r 2013; To increase local participation the PEA and help lower the financial burden, on 
many occasions PEA worked with the villagers who provided free labor and 
animal transport. Subsequently such workers received training to perform higher 
skilled jobs in neighboring areas and earned wages, increasing overall support for 
the program
; Finally a smart pricing policy enabled the PEA to realize a reasonable return on 
investments and retain sufficient funds to finance system expansion. The PEA 
lobbied for, and benefitted from a bulk power cross-subsidy from urban to rural 
customers. The national generation utility (EGAT) charged the PEA 30 percent 
less for bulk power sales than it charged the Metropolitan Electrification 
Authority—the entity responsible for distribution in urban areas. 
“The State and the People Work Together, the Central and Local Work Together”: 
Vietnam’s motto for Rapid Electrification 
Starting from a base of 2.5 percent in 1975, today Vietnam is being heralded as the 
developing country with the highest rate of rural electrification by the World Bank. Close to 
98 percent of total households in Vietnam are connected to the grid.
The country has relied on central, decentralized, and international support for the rapid and 
effective implementation of its electrification program. The Central Government and 
Provincial and Local Authorities agreed on a locally centered institutional framework, 
involving communities closely in the management and operation of local LV networks as 
well as to build a large, responsible customer base. A special effort was made to ensure clear 
communication to all stakeholders. The Central Government, EVN (national generation, 
transmission and distribution utility), and the World Bank worked together in formulating 
policies and projects and to solve problems. Two key features set the model apart, and 
contributed to its success:
; Sustainable Funding and Financing: Funds to support the large scale 
electrification were mobilized from practically every source, and in different ways. 
The Central Government always reserved funds to support the program, even 
when the budget was scarce. Communal, district, provincial budgets were also 
used to support the efforts. A cross-subsidy program was adopted, wherein each 
kWh consumed by customers in urban areas was subject to a surcharge to support 
the development of rural networks. Customers were directly asked to pay for a 
share of the infrastructure costs of bringing the grid to their area. Several 
agriculture cooperatives and communes borrowed from commercial banks to 
finance the development of the LV system in their areas. And finally, various 
donor agencies started supporting the program in a big way from 1996 onwards, 
offering soft loans and technical assistance
; Local Community Involvement and Capacity Building: The Government 
and EVN tried to include local communities to the extent possible from planning 
to construction to operation. For example they provided training to a large 
number of local people, who then became service agents responsible for routine 
technical and commercial operations and maintenance, such as meter reading, 
billing, collections, monitoring of rights-of-way, and minor repair of in-house 
wiring. This helped to speed communication, reduce the incidence of nonpayment because of a sense of local ownership, help lower operation and maintenance costs, and provide jobs. Additionally, during the construction of 
individual local networks, local participants were given an opportunity to bid for 
construction contracts or provide other services in support of construction. Local 
authorities were given the authority to approve the completion of all local 
contracts by the contractors. As a result of this approach, more than 600 
contracts were assigned to local contractors, enabling more rapid buildup of 
networks. Unified national technical standards from the 1990s, allowed for high 
quality work, but did not preclude local participation. 
Public Utility Driven Grid Extension in Lao PDR
The Government of Laos made a strong commitment and set targets for electrification. 
Electrification increased from 15% of the population in 1995 to 84% in 2011 (ahead of the 
targets set in 2002, which aimed for 70% by 2010 and 80% by 2015). The Government is 
now aiming for 90% electrification by 2020.
The targets are being achieved through establishing a strong implementation capacity in 
Electricity du Laos (EdL), the national utility. These included:
; Capacity building since mid 1990s, when the World Bank started the first rural 
electrification project 
; Efficiency in system planning, procurement, installation and commissioning
; A comprehensive system loss reduction program to reduce distribution system 
losses (and thus cost of services), with system loss declining to about 20% in 2005 
and to 10% in 2010, along with the fast expansion of the distribution system into 
rural areas.
The roll-out program was underpinned by a programmatic approach to tariff reform to 
ensure cost recovery and a profit margin for EdL and strong Government support to 
Electricity du Laos (EdL), a public utility company, to expand access to electricity services.
The tariff regime provided for cross-subsidies among consumer categories to ensure (i) 
affordability of rural housheolds; and (ii) weighted average tariff cover the weighted cost of 
services. However, financial support was provided to EdL when tariff did not cover the cost. 
A cost-recovery based tariff regime received strong endorsement from the Government.
EdL was further supported with concessional loans for rural electrification projects.
.Appendix B: Financial Model Assumptions and 
Methodology
Castalia built two dynamic excel based models for the purpose of developing an 
electrification investment prospectus for Myanmar:
; A standalone distribution roll-out model that calculates the total annualized 
costs of extending services to the un-electrified populations in Myanmar, under 
different assumptions and scenarios
; A model of the existing grid based system that combines cash costs of YESB 
and ESE with the estimates of the long-run marginal cost of generation and 
transmission to forecast the cash needs of the existing system over time. 
Both models calculate revenues under various tariff scenarios, and enable calculation of the 
funding gap both for the “old” and “new” system separately, and for the overall electricity 
system. The two models are combined to calculate the total annualized cash needs of the 
overall electricity system. Similarly, different tariff scenarios can be applied to forecast 
revenues of the overall electricity system, and hence the overall funding gap. Both models 
cover a 55 year period, and have been set out in constant real US dollars. 
The Stand-alone Distribution Roll-out Model
This section describes the model for the electrification roll-out.
B.1 Model Inputs and Assumptions
There are seven main categories of model inputs. 
B.1.1 Total Number of Connections by Type, to Reach Full Electrification
The model assumes there are three types of connection technologies—grid, mini-grid, and 
off-grid—to serve un-electrified populations in Myanmar. This information is provided by 
Earth Institute (EI), based on a detailed geospatial survey of the country, and matching each 
un-electrified population cluster with the least-cost electrification option available. In 
particular: 
; Grid connections involve connecting new communities to existing or new gridbased generation plants by extending the MV and LV lines
; Mini-grid connections involve serving between 100 to 200 households, with a 
small diesel-based generation system and connecting the households with LV 
lines. Although it is likely that other generation technologies exist to power minigrids (for example hydro, biomass), diesel provides the cost benchmark 
; Off-grid connections involve serving individual households in isolated 
communities with solar home systems.
B.1.2 Costs per Connection
The table below presents the various cost components for each connection technology 
and related assumptions. These costs are estimated based on (i) Earth Institute’s and 
Castalia’s international experience of conducting similar assignments, with adjustments for the local context in Myanmar, (ii) data provided by ESE and YESB16. 
Table B.1:Grid-based Cost Components

Diesel generator 139 US$/connection
O&M on LV lines 1 US$/connection/year

Diesel Costs 1.10 US$/per liter
For off-grid connections:

Cost Component Number or Range 
Assumed
Solar panel 845 US$/connection
 
16 Note that only the cost estimates for permanent grid, mini-grid and off-grid solutions are shown, since prelectrification 
connection costs can vary substantially. See accompanying EI report on cost assumptions for prelectrificationSolar battery 1,014 US$/connection
Solar balance of system 423 US$/connection
O&M on Solar Panel 42US$/connection/year
Solar Battery 51US$/connection/year
Solar Balance of System 21US$/connection/year
We assume that any asset with a lifetime less than 25 years would be replaced. The asset 
lifetimes were provided by EI. The replacement value is assumed to equal the initial capital 
cost of the asset in real terms. 
Table B.4: Assets that need to be Replaced 
Asset Lifetime Cost
Meter 10 years US$100 
Diesel generator 10 years U$845
Solar battery 3 years US$1014
Solar balance of system 10 years US$423
B.1.3 Sequence of Connection Roll-out
For grid connections—since the capital costs of grid based connections vary from one 
location to another, given the distance from the existing MV network and the size of the 
community being served (which affects transformer cost per connection), EI provided us 
with a least cost roll out sequence for making grid-based connections. An example is 
presented below.
Table B.5: Partial Snapshot of EI Roll out Sequence Algorithm Output
Source: EIFor non-grid connections—there is no least-cost sequence for off-grid and mini-grid 
connections, because they are isolated and self-sufficient systems and do not depend on 
existing networks. As a result, each mini-grid and off-grid system is assumed to cost about 
the same.
B.1.4 Demand
After holding discussions with ESE and YESB, and collecting statistics on average demand 
for currently connected households in Myanmar from MOEP, we assume that:
; Each newly connected household will consume 350kWh/connection in the first 
year of connection
; The household’s demand will continue to grow in each subsequent year following 
connection, until a steady state is reached in year 5, of 1000kWh per year per 
connection, after which there is a 3 percent annual growth rate per connection. 
This is consistent with observations from electrification projects from around the 
world. As households begin to appreciate the value that electricity brings, they are 
likely to buy more appliances and thus consume more electricity. The assumed 
demand growth profile is shown below:
Table B.6: Annual Baseline Demand Growth Profile (Base Case)
Source: Castalia model
It is important to note that although these numbers were used in the baseline scenario, the 
model has been built with the flexibility to change demand projections.
B.1.5 Revenue
There are two sources of revenue from customers: electricity tariffs for units of electricity 
consumed, and one-off connection fees charged for making a new connection. 
Castalia assumed the following base case electricity tariffs and connection scenarios:

Note that once again these numbers were used in the baseline scenario, but the model has 
been built with the flexibility to change the tariff and connection fee scenarios—including 
the base rate and the growth rate. 
B.1.6 Financing
The model assumes that all capital expenditures will be financed. We model key loan terms, 
including grace periods, tenor and interest rates. 
In the base case, we model loan terms along IDA lines:
; An annual interest rate of 1.25% 
; A five year grace period on principal repayment 
; A 25 year loan duration
; No grace period on interest payment
Additionally, the model has the ability to include multiple sources of loan financing that are 
arranged from least expensive to most expensive. As the cheaper loan source is exhausted, it 
automatically moves to the more expensive loan source. A snapshot from the model shows 
how this is organized:Figure 8.1: Snapshot of Financing Input Assumptions

B.1.7 Annual Connections Ramp up Profile by Type
Since least-cost roll-out plan focuses on the total number of connections that need to be 
made and the sequencing, Castalia made assumptions for the annual number of connections 
to be done in any given year. 
The model allows the flexibility to create other roll out scenarios by:
; Choosing whether the connections are (i) being arranged in a least-cost order 
nationally—that is the cheapest connections are chosen first no matter where 
they occur in the country, (ii) being arranged in a least-cost order by state—that 
is the roll out is sequenced for each state independently, starting from exiting 
grid and high demand centers in each state 
; Extend or reduce the roll out period. For example, 100 percent electrification can 
be completed in 2035 instead of 2030
; Change the total number of connections (grid, mini-grid, off-grid) done in any 
given year, as long by the end of the roll-out period the total number of 
connections match EI’s calculations
; Customize the roll out for a particular state. For example it is possible to 
completely ignore a state, or alternatively fix the number of connections that 
come from that particular state
; Change pre-electrification connections
Note that despite this flexibility, in all cases the grid connections that contribute to the total 
will be ordered in a least cost sequence.

Option 3
Source of loan JICAStep 1: Links Connection Scenarios (or Annual Connections Profile) to Least-Cost 
Roll out Order
The model first links the total number of annual connections (under any given connection 
scenario) to be done, with the least cost grid roll out sequence. This ensures that in any given 
year, the cheapest connections are indeed being selected first. Note that this only applies to 
grid connections since non-grid connections are not arranged in any particular order. 
Step 2: Aggregates total costs in each year
There are three cost categories. We elaborate on how they are aggregated:
; The total capital costs (initial costs plus replacement costs) per connection in 
each year, is multiplied by the total number of connections in that year. The 
capital costs are separated by grid, mini-grid, and off-grid
; Since the operating costs are recurrent, a schedule is created that multiplies the 
total operating cost per connection in that year, by the number of connections in 
that year. This cost is then incurred every year for the entire duration of the 
model. Operating cost schedules are separated by grid, mini-grid and off-grid
; Financing costs are calculated by creating a schedule that adds up for every 
annual loan amount drawn (i) the annual principal repayment and (ii) the interest 
amount due over time.
Step 3: Aggregates total revenues in each year
There are two sources of revenue. These are aggregated in the following way:
; To aggregate tariff revenues, the tariff for a particular year is multiplied by the 
amount of electricity consumed in that year. This is broken down by grid and 
mini-grid, since they each have different tariff and electricity consumption levels
; To aggregate connections fees, the connection fee in any given year is multiplied 
by the number of new connections. This is separated by connection fees earned 
from grid, mini-grid and off grid connections.
Step 4: Compiles total cost and revenue cashflows
The annual cashflows from the cost categories and revenue categories are brought together 
on to a single sheet. Adding and subtracting these various cash streams results in different 
outputs.
B.3 Model Outputs
The outputs produced by the model are closely interrelated:
The annual financing need—this is effectively the same as the total capital costs (capex), 
since we assume that all the capex will need to be financed, and that there is enough 
financing available to cover capex 
Annual operating subsidy—this takes the total revenues in each year and subtracts it from 
the total operating costs in each year. If this number is positive, it results in a surplus, if it is 
negative it results in a deficit. An operating subsidy from the government is needed to fill 
this deficit
Annual funding gap—this is calculated using the following formula: (Annual Revenue + Annual Upfront Financing Received) – (Annual Capital Cost + 
Operating Cost + Annual Interest & Principal Repayment) 
If the revenues and financing received is less than the sum of the costs, the government 
must intervene to fill the gap.
PV of the funding gap—this is simply the present value of the annual funding gap, 
discounted at a ten percent social discount rate.
These outputs can be altered by changing the following:
; Annual connections ramp up, or connections scenarios
; Tariff and connection fee projections
; Demand projections
