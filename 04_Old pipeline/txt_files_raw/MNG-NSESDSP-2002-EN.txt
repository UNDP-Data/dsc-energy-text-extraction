One. Background, scope and timeframe of the strategy plan 
The main objective of the “Mongolia Sustainable Energy Sector Development 
Strategy Plan (2002-2010)” is to create a financially sustainable energy sector that 
will provide cost-effective energy access, thereby enabling poverty reduction and 
greater private sector and civil society participation. Moreover, Mongolia’s energy 
sector should be developed within a regional energy context, while at the same time 
taking advantage of new technologies and sources of energy that might further 
promote economic efficiency and environmental sustainability.
