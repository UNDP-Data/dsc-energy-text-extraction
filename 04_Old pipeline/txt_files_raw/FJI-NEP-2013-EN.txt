This Strategic Action Plan has been prepared by a team of consultants under the Review of the 
Fiji National Energy Policy project with the support of the Department of Energy. The 
consultants are contracted under the Coping with Climate Change in the Pacific Island Region
(CCCPIR) programme, which is funded by GIZ and the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP), and jointly implemented by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community 
(SPC) and GIZ.STRATEGIC ACTION PLAN 
October 2013 Introduction 
This Strategic Action Plan sets out the key actions for the period 2013 to 2020 that are
required by different stakeholders to implement the new National Energy Policy 2013. The 
plan is applicable to all stakeholders in the energy sector, although most actions are led by 
the Department of Energy (DoE), as the public sector institution with primary responsibility 
for planning and policy development. The Strategic Action Plan will be reviewed and 
updated on a yearly basis. 
Policy areas 
The policy areas used to categorise strategic actions align with the National Energy Policy 
(NEP), with governance and institutional arrangements treated as a separate policy area. 
Rather than repeat content of the NEP in this Strategic Action Plan, we refer to the NEP for 
full policy statements and assessments of the current situation (by policy area).
Strategic actions 
This Strategic Action Plan should be constantly evolving through regular updates. This 
means that we do not need to pre-empt every single detailed action between now and 2020, 
but rather focus on the actions required in the next few years. This Strategic Action Plan still 
sets out the key actions to be taken beyond that, but in broader terms; expecting that detail 
will be added closer to the time. 
Many of the actions are separated for maximum clarity, but in practice will be combined (for 
example into a single technical assistance project).
Many of the indicative timeframes are clearly dependent on each other and therefore they 
will need to be updated regularly based on progress – although it is important that the 
implementing agencies do not let actions get delayed beyond 2020 and never implemented 
(as has been observed with past action plans).
Estimation of budgets 
The estimated budget is very approximate and for time/staff costs only. It excludes any cost 
of equipment and materials. All values are given in 2013 Fiji Dollars. The estimated budget 
is split into two components for some actions:
 The cost of Government agency/institution staff time: A cost of 1,600 
FJD/month is assumed, based on the current approximate average pay scale at 
DoE. 
 The cost of technical assistance (TA): A cost of 45,000 FJD/month is assumed, 
based on an approximate monthly rate of 25,000 USD/month including 
expenses. In practice, it is expected that technical assistance will be provided by regional organisations 
such as the Secretariat of the Pacific Community or funded through grants by development 
partners. It is also possible that if the institutional restructuring of DoE is very successful, 
that it will be able to carry out many of the actions in-house (without technical assistance).Policy area I. Governance and institutional arrangements
