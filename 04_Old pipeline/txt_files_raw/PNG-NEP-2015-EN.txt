The way in which we produce, supply and consume energy is of vital importance to 
sustainable development in all facets, as energy has deep relationships with each of 
its four dimensions – the social welfare, the economy, the environment and the 
energy security. 
These relationships are developing in a rather fast and complex manner due to 
increase globalization, growing market liberalization and new technologies, as well 
as by growing concerns about the climate which we live in and about energy supply 
security which is vital for vibrant economy and depends on adequate and reliable 
energy supply. PNG is a fast growing economy and the Government sees the 
importance to encourage diversification of energy supply sources in order to achieve 
energy security and promote competition amongst the suppliers. 
Energy must be an integral part of sustainable development in PNG, and the 
Government is pleased that this policy- PNG’s National Energy Policy, is cohesively 
balanced among the three dimensions of sustainable development. Energy the 
engine room for economic development of any successful nation and the O’Neill 
Government embraces this fact, and that is why the prudent management of the 
energy sector must is placed high in the echelons of the Government’s top priorities.
Papua New Guinea lies at the cross-road from traditionally subsistence-based 
society to a modern era as one. Geographically, it is located at the cross-road 
between Asia and the Pacific nations including Australia and New Zealand. Also at 
the crossroad is the National Energy Policy. 
PNG’s energy sector was developed through various Acts of Parliament but its 
development was not coordinated properly for a period of 40 years since attaining 
political Independence in 1975. At this juncture, we need to develop and 
operationalize a National Energy Policy with its accompanying Plan - The National 
Energy Plan. Planning is essential for the nation’s social and economic development 
within a sound environmental consideration. The Government recognizes the value 
and importance of the country’s rich renewable sector and the focus of energy 
development in the future will be on this sector. 
It is an honour and pleasure for us to dedicate this National Energy Policy to the 
people of Papua New Guinea for a prosperous, energized and a happy nation in the 
next 40 years.…………………………………. …………………………………

EnergyPREFACE BY SECRETARIES FOR DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC ENTERPRISES & 
DEPARTMENT OF PETROLEUM AND ENERGY
This document sets out the national policy and strategies for the energy sector 
that are aligned to the legislative reforms in tandem with Papua New Guinea’s 
Vision 2050. 
To transform Papua New Guinea into a globally competitive, newly 
industrialized, with middle income status and a prosperous country, it needs low 
cost energy. This will be the impetus for industrialization.
Within the energy sector, the production and consumption of electricity have 
changed along with the changes in the economy and the resulting changes in 
the sector’s market.
The government has realized that Papua New Guinea is endowed with 
abundance of indigenous renewable energy sources which still remain 
underutilized and must be harnessed to stimulate the growth of this sector. 
Traditionally the State has focused on the classical forms of energy – the 
hydrocarbons, but must now consider developing the other sources of energy, 
including biofuel, biogas, biomass, coal, geothermal, hydro, solar and wind.
In essence, how do we harness this sources of energy to synergize the growth of 
the sector?
The emergence of this new policy and the legislative reforms that are being 
undertaken will support the Government’s active participation within the industry 
to reform and stimulate the growth in the energy sector. This will include 
institutional reforms to align policy, regulations and commercial operations.………………………………………. ………………………………………
Dr Clement Waine PhD Mr Rendle Rimua
Acting Secretary Secretary
Department of Public Enterprises & State Investments Department of Petroleum & EnergyEXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1. Energy is the engine of economic growth. Therefore the Government 
recognises the need to manage the energy sector in a manner that is 
efficient and sustainable. Development of the country’s energy resources 
therefore will be coordinated in a manner that guarantees PNG attains 
sustainable income from energy exports while at the same time, the 
Government wants to see the unit cost of energy reduced in order to make 
PNG an internationally competitive country to invest in. 
2. The provision of reliable, accessible and affordable energy contributes to 
economic and social development, and development in turn depends on 
more use of energy for the nation’s sustenance but in a manner that is 
technically sound and the sector is efficiently regulated. Hence, this policy is 
all about finding a balance between making PNG an attractive investment 
destination for exporting energy to the energy hungry world and at the same 
time promoting PNG’s economic development based on low energy cost. 
3. The overall objective of the energy policy is to ensure affordable, competitive, 
sustainable and reliable supply of energy to meet national and provincial
development needs at least cost, while protecting and conserving the 
environment. 
4. The energy sector is guided by the Oil & Gas Act 1998, Mining Act, Electricity 
Industry Act and a number of other legislations. With the adoption of the PNG 
Vision 2050, there is need to formulate both the policy and accompanying
legislations so as to align them with the Vision; the statutes shall be reviewed 
and consolidated into one. 
Overview of the PNG Energy Sector
5. The energy sector currently accounts for 14% of the country’s GDP and is a 
critical enabler for all other sectors for building a modern PNG economy.
Major developments are expected in the energy sector and the economy on 
the back of the successful commencement of the world class PNG LNG 
project in 2014. The Energy sector will continue to contribute substantially to 
that growth
6. The Energy Sector includes assets related to three key energy resources: (i) 
electric power, (ii) fossil fuels (including petroleum, and natural gas and coal); and (iii) renewable energy (including Hydro, Geothermal, Solar, Wind, Wave, 
Tidal, Ocean current, biofuel).
Fossil Fuels 
7. Papua New Guinea has commercial reserves of LNG and a diminishing 
reserve of oil. In order to fast track petroleum discovery in other exploration 
blocks in the country, the Government shall intensify primary data acquisition 
in the available blocks to make them more attractive to investors. 
8. There is therefore need to develop adequate petroleum production capacity in 
the country, and also develop the petroleum supply infrastructure to meet 
market requirements to match the increasing demand for petroleum products 
locally and in the region. 
9. Coal is an affordable, competitive, reliable and easily accessible source of 
energy, especially for electricity generation. Extensive coal exploration has 
taken place in Gulf Province. More coal exploration is going on in other parts 
of the country.
10.The Government shall promote an intensive coal exploration programme and 
efficient utilisation of coal resources while minimising the environmental 
impacts associated with its use. It will establish data and information on coal 
resources intensify promotional campaigns in local and international 
conferences and exhibitions. A conducive investment environment for 
exploration and exploitation of coal will be created by providing fiscal 
incentives to attract investment in this sector. The National Government shall 
establish a coal development corporation as a special purpose vehicle to be 
the lead agency in the development of the coal industry. 
Renewable Energy
11.Renewable energy, derived from the naturally occurring resources including 
geothermal, hydro, solar, wind and tidal wave energy, biomass, biofuels, 
biogas and municipal waste can supply our needs and those of future 
generations in a sustainable way if effectively harnessed through careful 
planning and advanced technology. In addition, renewable energy has 
potential to enhance energy security, mitigate climate change, generate 
income, create employment and generate foreign exchange savings. 12.Papua New Guinea has huge hydro power potential, currently estimated at 
15,000MW, which when developed, would significantly boost PNG’s energy 
requirements.
13.The Government shall establish the National Energy Authority of Papua New 
Guinea (NEA) to be the umbrella agency for development of fossil fuels and 
renewable energy resources.
14.The Government shall establish the Energy Regulatory Commission 
(ENERCOM) to take custody of all regulatory functions within the energy and 
electricity industries.
Electricity Sub-Sector 
15.Electricity is a secondary source of energy generated through the 
consumption of primary energy sources. By virtue of its versatility in 
application, electricity is crucial to the socio-economic development of the 
country and is the most sought after energy service, access to which is 
associated with rising or high quality of life. In order to ensure there is 
affordable and accessible electricity supply, there is a need to restructure and 
reform the electricity supply industry.
Unbundling PNG Power Ltd
16.PNG Power Limited (PPL) is a fully integrated power authority responsible for 
generation, transmission, distribution and retailing of electricity throughout 
Papua New Guinea servicing individual electricity consumers in almost all 
urban centres throughout the country encompassing industrial, commercial, 
government and domestic sectors.
17.PPL suffers legacy issues requiring attention and redress. The GoPNG will 
unbundle the current PNG Power Limited (PPL) into distinct entities operating 
in the Generation, Transmission, Distribution and Retail and Regulation.
Energy Financing, Trading, Pricing and Socio-Economic Issues 
18.The Government through the NEA shall: (a) Explore and adopt all viable financing options from local and 
international sources for cost effective utilization of all its energy 
resources, and in so doing shall endeavour to maintain a competitive 
fiscal investment climate in the country. 
(b) Support Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) in the development, 
operation and maintenance of energy infrastructure and delivery 
systems. 
19.The Government shall set up a Consolidated Energy Fund (CONSEF) to cater 
for funding of the proposed:
a. National Energy Institute;
b. Infrastructure development; 
c. Acquisition and management of strategic petroleum resources; 
d. Energy sector environmental disaster mitigation, response and 
recovery;
e. Hydro risk mitigation;
f. Energy efficiency and conservation programmes, and:
g. Promotion of renewable energy initiatives. 
20.National Electricity Market will be developed where electricity will be traded as 
a commodity. It will involve both wholesale generation that is transported via 
interconnected grid of high voltage transmission lines to electricity distributors, 
who deliver it to consumers (homes and businesses). The transport of 
electricity from generators to consumers is facilitated through a ‘pool’, or spot 
market, where the output from all generators is aggregated and scheduled at 
five minute intervals to meet demand.
Energy Efficiency and Conservation 
21.The importance of energy efficiency and conservation measures in the Papua 
New Guinean economy cannot be overemphasized. Challenges to 
implementation of energy efficiency and conservation initiatives include lack of 
awareness of the benefits and methods of conservation, apathy, limited 
technical capacity and inadequate data. 
Land, Environment, Health and Safety 
22.In carrying out its planning and development function regarding electricity and 
gas reticulation and energy regulation, every Provincial government shall set aside suitable land for energy infrastructure development purposes, including 
but not limited to projects recommended in the indicative national energy 
plans. 
Cross Cutting Issues 
23.The Minister responsible for energy matters may establish directorates with 
responsibility for policy development as well integrated national planning in 
the areas of oil and gas, coal resources, renewable energy, electricity, nuclear 
energy for electricity generation as well as energy efficiency and conservation.
24.Research, Development and Dissemination as well as human resource 
development are key in achieving the objectives of this policy. It is therefore 
necessary to establish a National Energy Institute (NEI) to undertake training, 
research, development, innovation, dissemination, nurture talent and to 
enhance capacity building in the sector.1
1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 PNG’S NEED FOR A NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY
1. In any country, one will find a definition that must fit the need of energy and what it 
must do for that country. Papua New Guinea is no exception. Since the country 
came in to being during the pre-colonial era, some form of strategies were 
adopted by different administrations in Papua and New Guinea to address 
pressing issues in the energy sector. There was very little development at least 
for the whole country compared to now.
2. Energy security is all about the continuous availability of energy at all times in 
various forms, in sufficient quantities, and at affordable prices. These conditions 
must prevail over the long term because energy contributes to sustainable 
development and growth of any nation. In PNG attention to energy security is 
critical because of the uneven distribution of the fossil fuel and other alternate 
renewable resources on which PNG currently rely and the capacity to develop 
other resources. Thus, the energy supply could become more vulnerable over the 
near term due to the growing global reliance on imported oil. Although energy
security has been adequate for the past 50 years, and has contributed to the 
economic development of the Nation. However the potential for conflict,
sabotage, disruption of trade, and reduction in strategic reserves cannot be 
dismissed. These potential threats point to the necessity of strengthening national 
energy security. Options to enhance energy security include:
a. Avoiding excessive dependence on imports by increasing end-use 
efficiency.
b. Encouraging greater reliance on local resources particularly those whose 
development will have other positive externalities such as job creation, 
capacity building, and pollution reduction, provided these do not involve 
disproportionate costs or waste scarce resources.
c. Diversifying supply (including both suppliers and energy forms).
d. Fostering greater political stability through international cooperation and 
long-term 
e. Agreements among energy importing countries and between importing and 
exporting countries. 
f. Encouraging technology transfers (for example, through Joint Ventures and 
Public-Private Partnerships) to developing countries so they can develop 
local resources and improve energy efficiencies.
g. Increasing national strategic reserves of crude oil and its products.2
3. Papua New Guinea has significant potential indigenous energy resources 
reserves including oil, gas, coal, hydroelectricity and renewable energy that can 
be harnessed to accelerate PNG’s development and progress in leaps and 
bounds. The energy sector currently accounts for 14% of the country’s GDP. On 
the back of the successful world class PNG LNG project which commenced 
shipment of gas to overseas market in April 2014, the PNG Energy Sector can 
provide the foundation for growth for all other sectors in building a modern PNG 
economy. This can only happen if PNG’s equity is raised.
4. However energy shortages and supply disruptions coupled with high cost 
remains serious obstacles to economic activity and growth in PNG. At present 
eighty seven percent (87%) of PNG’s population, still lack access to electricity
services and the progress of rural electrification has lagged over the years. The
prolonged absence of an overarching energy policy to guide the development
of the energy sector and the high investment cost due to PNG’s rugged
topography and remote communities is a major impediment to provision of
accessible and affordable energy and electricity services in particular. 
However, the government did well to approve the Electricity Industry Policy (EIP) 
and NEROP to carry out a 15 year programme on rural electrification.
5. The national government of Papua New Guinea envisions through its DSP 
2010-2030 that by the year 2030, seventy percent (70%) of the country will be
having access to electricity. By 2050 the PNG economy s h o u l d a t t a i n 
o n e h u n d r e d p e r c e n t power s u p p l y f r o m renewable and sustainable
energy sources, and all households would have access to a reliable and 
affordable energy supply (Vision 2050). There is one catch to all these effort and 
that is that everyone must pay for the energy he/she uses in order to be 
sustainable. 
6. A comprehensive forward looking and well co-ordinated National Energy
Policy is needed now more than ever to provide government leadership in the
energy sector to seize major economic opportunities and respond effectively to
long-term challenges for energy security including the issues of climate change. 
7. This Policy is designed with Sustainable Development principles in mind and is
intended to operate for a period of five years and reviewed thereafter.3
1.2 STRUCTURE OF THE NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY
This policy document is organised into twelve substantive chapters, starting with 
the Introduction in Chapter 1. Chapters 2 provide the overview of the energy

2 OVERVIEW OF ENERGY SECTOR IN PNG
2.1 THE ROLE OF ENERGY IN NATIONAL ECONOMY
1. Papua New Guinea has attained a strong economic growth achieving an average 
of 6.0% annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate from 2005 – 2014 with 
projections of over 16% growth in 2015 and beyond.
2. The energy sector currently accounts for 14% of the country’s GDP and is a 
critical enabler for all other sectors for building a modern PNG economy. Major 
developments are expected in the energy sector and the economy on the back of 
the successful commencement of the world class PNG LNG project in 2014. The 
Energy sector will continue to contribute substantially to that growth.
Figure 1: Primary Energy Supply in PNG
Source: APEC Energy Demand and Supply Outlook – 4th edition, 2009
3. Based on the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Energy Balance Report 
(EBR) 2009, PNG’s primary energy supply is projected to increase at an average 
annual rate of 5.1%, from 1.8 Mtoe in 2005 to 6.3 Mtoe in 2030 (see Figure 1). In 
terms of primary energy supply in 2011 petroleum oil products accounted for 
approximately 57%, biomass 37% and hydro, gas and geothermal power the 
remaining 6%. Oil and natural gas will constitute most of the share in the total 
primary energy supply for domestic use and export. The demand for oil is 11
concentrated in the industrial sector, followed by electricity and transport, while the 
demand for natural gas will be driven by the electricity generation.
4. The Energy Sector includes assets related to three key energy resources: (i) 
electric power, (ii) fossil fuels (including petroleum, and natural gas and coal); and 
(iii) renewable energy (including Hydro, Geothermal, Solar, Wind, Wave, Tidal, 
Ocean current, biofuel). Each of these energy sources have been dealt with in 
detail in the subsequent chapters of this Policy.
5. As at 2014 petroleum accounts for about 57% of the total primary energy 
consumed in the country. Petroleum is mainly used in the transport, power 
generation, commercial and industrial sectors as well as households. There is no 
Coal usage in the country. Chapters 3 treated fossil fuels in greater detail in terms 
of upstream and mid and downstream petroleum and gas.
6. PNG is richly endowed with renewable energy sources that when harness can 
meet the Vision 2050 target of PNG been 100% power by renewable sources. It is 
estimated that PNG has hydropower potential of about 15,000MW comprising 
large and small hydros1.
7. The electricity portion of the Energy Sector includes the generation, transmission, 
and distribution and retail of electricity.
8. Currently, there are two main stand-alone power grids—in Port Moresby and in 
the Lae–Madang–Highlands area (the Ramu grid)—and a number of smaller grids 
that service the smaller urban centres. Because of the unreliability of grid supply, 
there is considerable self-generation and back-up generation taking place in urban 
areas, but maintenance and operation costs are high and efficiencies low.
9. PNG has about 580 megawatts (MW) of installed generation capacity, including 
hydropower (230 MW or 39.7%), diesel (217 MW or 37.4%), gas-fired (82 MW or 
14.1%), and geothermal (53 MW or 9.1%). PNG has significant underutilized 
indigenous energy sources such as hydropower, natural gas, geothermal, and 
solar.

ADB 2009, TA 4932-PNG Final Report: “PNG Power Sector Development Plan”, page 3. 12
10.In Papua New Guinea (PNG), about 13% of the household population has access 
to electricity. Where power is available (generally in the main urban centres), the 
supply is often unreliable. Access to electricity is very limited in off-grid rural 
areas. Lack of access to affordable, reliable power is limiting economic growth in 
urban areas, constraining growth in smaller urban centres, and contributing to 
poverty in rural areas
11.PNG Power Limited (PPL), the national state-owned corporatized power utility, 
manages installed generation capacity of about 300 MW, including the two main 
grids and 19 independent power systems that service 26 smaller urban centres. 
The remaining capacity of about 280 MW comprises: (i) self-generation systems 
owned and operated by industrial facilities, including mining companies; and (ii) 
private sector generators supplying the main grids or rural communities. The 
government's ownership in PPL is maintained through the Independent Public 
Business Corporation.
12.Sector policy formulation is managed by the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy 
and, specifically, the Energy Division.
13.Technical regulation of the sector is performed by PPL itself through agreement 
with the Consumer and Competition Commission; however, although it is intended 
to eventually transfer this function to the Energy Division, through this policy it 
should be transferred to National Energy Authority.
14.Key research activity in the power sector occurs at the University of Technology in 
Lae, particularly through the Rural Energy Research Group. Through this policy
an Institute will be established for Energy RD&D.
Oil and Petroleum Products
15.As at 2014 petroleum accounts for about 57% of the total primary energy consumed 
in the country. Petroleum is mainly used in the transport, power generation, 
commercial and industrial sectors as well as households. There is no Coal usage in 
the country. Chapters 3 treated fossil fuels in greater detail in terms of upstream 
and mid and downstream petroleum and gas.
16.PNG is richly endowed with renewable energy sources that when harness can meet 
the Vision 2050 target of PNG been 100% power by renewable sources. It is 
estimated that PNG has hydropower potential of greater than 15,000MW comprising 
large and small hydros.13
Gas
17.Gas development is on the rise with InterOil, Stanley project and Larus projects 
likely to come on stream. At the tail end of all these, the government must ensure 
some gas is available for domestic use in power generation to help meet the 70 
percent of the households to be electrified by 2030. Then to progress upwards to 
meet the remaining 30 percent after 2030 and by 2050 all households must be fully 
electrified in terms of electricity connectivity. 
Electricity
18.PNG Power Limited (PPL), the national state-owned corporatized power utility, 
manages installed generation capacity of s o m e 300 MW, including the two 
main grids and 19 independent power systems that service 26 smaller urban 
centres. The remaining capacity of about 280 MW comprises: (i) self-generation 
systems owned and operated by industrial facilities, including mining companies;
and (ii) private sector generators supplying the main grids or rural communities.
The government's ownership in PPL is maintained through the Independent 
Public Business Corporation.
19.Technical regulation of the sector is performed by PPL itself through agreement with
the Consumer and Competition Commission; however, although it is intended to
eventually transfer this function to the Energy Division, through this policy it should 
be transferred to National Energy Authority under the auspicious of the Electricity 
Industry Policy.
20.There are several private sector power generators operating in PNG, including 
Hanjung Power, a private company that operates a power station (26.4 MW) 
supplying the Port Moresby grid; (ii) PNG Sustainable Energy, which operates 
various rural grids in Western Province and is expanding operations to other 
parts of the country; and (iii) mining operations that maintain significant levels of selfgeneration capacity. In addition, (i) provincial governments have responsibility for
maintaining stand-alone rural generation facilities (C-centres), churches provide
electricity to some off-grid villages, and (iii) the larger mining sites sometimes 
supply power to adjacent communities.
21.The electricity portion of the Energy Sector includes the generation, transmission, 
and distribution and retail of electricity.14
22.Currently, there are two main stand-alone power grids—in Port Moresby and in the 
Lae–Madang–Highlands area (the Ramu grid); and a third grid called Gazelle grid 
and a number of smaller grids that service the smaller urban centres. Because of 
the unreliability of grid supply, there is considerable self-generation and back-up 
generation taking place in urban areas, but maintenance and operation costs are 
high and efficiencies low.
23.PNG has about 580 megawatts (MW) of installed generation capacity, including 
hydropower (230 MW or 39.7%), diesel (217 MW or 37.4%), gas-fired (82 MW or 
14.1%), and geothermal (53 MW or 9.1%). PNG has significant under-utilized 
indigenous energy sources such as hydropower, natural gas, geothermal, and solar.
24.In Papua New Guinea (PNG), about 13% of the household population has access to 
electricity. Where power is available (generally in the main urban centres), the 
supply is often unreliable. Access to electricity is very limited in off-grid rural areas.
Lack of access to affordable, reliable power is limiting economic growth in urban
areas, constraining growth in smaller urban centres, and contributing to poverty in 
rural areas. An SME study in 2014 confirmed this.
Renewable Energy
25.Renewable Energy is the most abundant source of energy in PNG and if fully 
harnessed can contribute to 100 percent powering of electricity in the country. PNG 
is endowed with many of these resources. However, the drawback is the costs 
involved with their implementation and the maturity of the technology to harness 
electricity. 
26.The Vision 2050 directs that by 2050, all electricity supply security must come from 
renewable energy so the onus is now on us to ensure various forms of renewable 
energy must be tested and planned for utilisation for the peoples and the business 
community’s benefit.2.2 LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
1. Energy is a broader subject with its various legal and regulatory environment
loosely administered by various organizations under different laws.
2. Papua New Guinea’s governing laws on the industry include: the Constitution 
of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, Independent Consumer &
Competition Commission Act 2002, Electricity Industry Act 2002, Oil & Gas 
Act 1996 and the Mining Act 1992. There are other key supporting legislations 
though that provides a cumbersome and loose legal framework within which 
the energy sector operates.
3. These institutions and agencies have their own weaknesses and challenges, 
together with the laws they are administering, some of which dates back to as 
far as independence days. Given such an operating environment, it would be 
an understatement to suggest any one legal and regulatory framework. 
4. This Policy recognizes these many challenges and shortfalls some of which 
include, fiscal, funding, legal and policy vacuums, institutional, technical, 
entrepreneurial abilities, knowledge, environment and social; and aims to 
address the immediate needs of the industry, especially in so far as energy 
uses for electricity is concerned, to kick-start the process of aligning the 
legislative and policy environment.
2.2.1 CONSTITUTION OF THE INDEPENDENT STATE OF PAPUA NEW 
GUINEA
1. In the Preamble to the Constitution, National Goal and Directive Principal three 
(3) provides for the Government to base their planning for the political, 
economic and social development and take effective measures to control and 
actively participate in the national economic, and in particular to control major 
enterprises engaged in the exploitation of natural resources.
2. Goal four (4) provides for Papua New Guinea’s natural resources and 
environment to be conserved and used for the collective benefit of all, and be 
replenished for the benefit of future generations.3. These provisions in essence, provides for the aligning of the energy sector 
policy, legal and regulatory framework with these provisions, spirit and 
aspirations of the Constitution. 
2.2.2 CURRENT POLICY AND LEGISLATION
There are several policies and legislations which have an implication for the 
energy policy, these are:
1. Electricity Industry Policy provides for inter-alia, the promotion of competition 
within the electricity industry. This Policy is operative for a period of only three 
years (2011-2014) and is overdue for a review. At this juncture too we hope to 
introduce two new policies; the Renewable Energy Policy and Rural 
Electrification which is being funded by the World Bank.
2. The Oil and Gas Act 1996 was enacted to regulate the negotiation and 
conclusion by the Government of petroleum agreements relating to the 
exploration for, development, production and transportation of, petroleum. 
3. Geothermal Energy Policy provides the framework for the usage and 
regulation of geothermal resources use when it concerns electricity generation 
from heat and steam.
4. Mining Act 1992 was enacted to regulate the exploration for, development, 
production and transportation of minerals excluding petroleum. 
5. The Mineral Resources Authority was established by an Act of Parliament in 
2005 and is responsible for the management, exploration and development of 
Papua New Guinea’s mineral resources, including safety in mining operations.
6. The ICCC Act 2002 establishes the regime for consumer protection, 
promoting and protection of competition, and regulating of State Owned 
Monopolies.
7. Alongside the foregoing principal Acts, there are several other Acts that 
impact the energy sector, including:-
a. The National Institute of Standards and Industrial Technology Act -
provides for establishment of minimum quality specifications, mode, 
materials and apparatus for energy used in the country. Also sets standards for storage tanks and dispensing equipment for sale of petroleum

and procedures in relation to registration of customary land for 
development and related purposes.
i. The Income Tax Act 1959, provides for the tax arrangements in the 
country.
j. The Land Titles Commission Act 1962 establishes the land titles 
commission as an independent judicial tribunal for the resolution of 
disputes of rights in land, including an interest in land, whether arising out 
of and regulated by custom or otherwise, provides for judicial procedures 
and the extrajudicial settlement of disputes and some other matters.2.3 CURRENT INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
2.3.1 INSTITUTIONS
1. The institutional arrangements for the PNG energy sector are currently very 
fragmented where critical functions of the sector are vested in different 
institutions by the respective legislation as listed above. Each institution pursues 
separate but interlinked goals consistent with their own laws.
i. Department of Petroleum and Energy (DP&E)
The Department of Petroleum and Energy was established to promote and 
regulate the development of petroleum and other sources of energy for the 
long term benefits of the State in a way which is ethical, socially responsible

be the Nominee of all Petroleum Development in the Country.
xiii.Petromin (PNG) Holdings Limited (Petromin)
Petromin PNG Holdings Limited is an independent company created by the 
State of Papua New Guinea to hold the State's assets and to maximise 
indigenous ownership and revenue gains in the mineral and petroleum 
sectors.
It is empowered as the vehicle to better leverage the State's equity holdings 
and encourage more production and downstream processing of oil, gas and 
minerals in PNG through proactive investment strategies either wholly or in 
partnership with resource developers.
2. The Institutional arrangements of the energy sector will be streamlined to 
encourage efficiency, access and affordability. The energy regulatory functions 
both technical as well as economic will be brought under a new structure as 
detailed in chapter 11, specifically under the proposed Electricity Regulatory 
Commission which will perform this role.
3. The unbundled PPL will result in Kumul Power Ltd and the subsidiary companies 
and specialised entities as detailed in Chapter 7.3 FOSSIL FUELS
3.1 BACKGROUND
1. Fossil fuels consists of petroleum (oil, and natural gas) and coal resources. 
As at 2014 petroleum accounts for about 57% of the total primary energy 
consumed in the country. Petroleum is mainly used in the transport, power 
generation, commercial and industrial sectors as well as households. There 
is no Coal usage in the country. 
2. The petroleum industry is broadly divided into three categories namely: 
upstream (exploration and production), mid-stream (storage, refining and 
transportation) and down-stream (supply and distribution). Midstream and 
downstream operations are usually combined. 
3. The monetization of natural gas is frequently more complex than the 
commercialization of liquid hydrocarbons. Frequently investments will be 
required in interrelated links in the supply chain, including upstream, 
midstream, downstream and consumption facilities. 
3.2 UPSTREAM PETROLEUM
3.2.1 PETROLEUM EXPLORATION & PRODUCTION
1. Papua New Guinea has benefited profoundly through significant foreign 
investment in its upstream petroleum exploration sector over the last 30 year 
where some of the players are leading international oil companies. 
2. The existing oil fields have already reached their peak plateau and are now 
declining due to natural pressure decline. 
3. Currently there are accelerated exploration activities undertaken in the 
country and the prospect of new oil and gas discoveries appears promising. 
The marked increase in petroleum exploration interest is attributed to;
a. Existence of an attractive legal, regulatory framework, fiscal and 
acceptable risk-reward balance incentive;
b. Intensive promotion activities by the Government; and
c. Rising world crude oil prices.
4. PNG commissioned its first commercial gas project in 1991 which was to 
produce electricity for a nearby gold mine. Its major export-based gas project was the US$ 19 Billion PNG LNG Project which was successfully 
commissioned in 2014.
5. As at 2014, Papua New Guinea’s Petroleum Projects are shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2. – Petroleum Projects, 2014
Source: PNG Chamber of Mines and Petroleum, 2013
6. There are many undeveloped gas fields in the country with proven and 
probable reserves of over 20 trillion cubic feet of gas. Most of these 
discoveries are small to medium size fields.
7. As of May 2014, Papua New Guinea has joined the exclusive club of LNG 
producers and exporters. With increased petroleum exploration being 
undertaken both on-shore and off-shore in the country’s major sedimentary 
basins there is now the possibility that more reserves of natural gas would be 
discovered in commercial quantities. The Government will ensure 15% of 
gas reserves in new Oil and Gas projects should be made available for 
domestic gas utilization.
8. The Government recognises the significance of the industry and is determined 
to promote efficiency in the overall administration and regulation of the 
hydrocarbon industry.3.2.2 CHALLENGES IN PETROLEUM UPSTREAM
1. There are several challenges in the petroleum sector; these are:
(a) Attraction of capital for petroleum exploration and production activities, which 
are highly capital intensive due to the rugged geography.
(b) High cost of acquisition of new technology.
(c) Limited primary technical data in most of the country’s exploration blocks. 
2. Inherent weaknesses in the Petroleum Development License are:
(a) Compensation regime. 
(b) Licensing rounds. 
(c) Community awareness and participation. 
(d) Windfall profits. 
(e) Gas sharing terms. 
(f) Environmental protection, conservation and management. 
(g) Mechanism for working out national government, provincial government 
and local level government benefits sharing. 
(h) Payment of royalty on gross oil produced.
(i) National Content in Project Development.
(j) Domestic Market Obligation.
3. Petroleum resource is finite.
4. Inadequate policy for sustainable utilization of petroleum revenue and its 
management.
5. The lower wellhead price of natural gas, be it caused either by having to 
compete with lower cost alternative fuels in the domestic market or as a result 
of lower netback prices into the export markets, and longer project lead times, 
makes it extremely challenging to economically develop a natural gas industry 
based on oil-based fiscal terms.
6. High cost and inexistence of gas infrastructure to support gas discovery and 
development both offshore and onshore. 7. Inability to disaggregate into component elements of supply chain e.g cost of 
wholesale gas, transportation and distribution in order to price the gas.
8. Unlike oil, there is no world gas price. 
9. Lack of gas master plan.
3.2.3 POLICIES AND STRATEGIES – PETROLEUM UPSTREAM
1. Necessary amendments to be made to the existing legislations (especially Oil 
and Gas Act and the ICCC Act) governing hydro carbons to ensure that no 
vertical integration takes place in the investment, extraction, processing 
distribution and transportation of hydrocarbons.
2. Establish a one stop source for petroleum upstream licensing and operations 
to be known as the Petroleum Resources Authority. It will be the overall 
Regulator of the Industry.
3. Develop a policy on management of commercial discoveries of petroleum 
resources. 
4. Promote petroleum exploration and production activities through 
encouragement of PPP arrangements.
5. Sub-divide and create new petroleum exploration blocks, based on technical 
data and negotiate favourable work programmes that will see investors with 
requisite capacity assist in data acquisition.
6. Introduce model Production Sharing Contracts (PSC).
7. Continuation of petroleum and gas agreements but with fiscal terms taken out 
and included in the general legislation.
8. Cash bidding for the unallocated, relinquished and surrendered exploration 
acreage.
9. Contracting out of early stage geological survey work, financed out of 
proceeds of cash bidding for exploration acreage.10.Review the Oil & Gas Act 1998 (OGA 1998) to incorporate industry best 
practice adapted to fit local conditions. The revised Act shall provide for gas 
sharing terms, compensation, windfall profits, royalties and Corporate Social 
Responsibility, licensing rounds; community awareness and participation; 
windfall profits; bonuses as may be applicable, gas sharing terms; 
government share out of monetary gains, environmental protection; 
conservation and management; sharing of benefits mechanism between the 
national , provincial and local level governments and local community; 
payment of royalty on gross oil produced; local content requirement.
11.Develop mechanisms for sharing and management of petroleum benefits, in 
line with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).
12.Enhance corporate governance in the Government institutions charged with 
petroleum charged with exploration and development.
13.Strengthen monetary and fiscal regimes to maximize the government take on 
petroleum exploitation while taking into account the investors interests.
14.Provide incentives for investments in marginal oil and gas discoveries that 
could have the potential to deliver much financial and socio- economic value.
15.Develop local content policy that covers technology and knowledge transfer, 
capacity building of local industry and local employment opportunities as well 
as laws and regulations to govern local content implementation.
16.Ensure that petroleum exploration and production activities shall include 
technology transfer and development of local manpower; including engaging 
qualified local personnel as a priority.
17.Enhance manpower and technical capacity in petroleum exploration by 
establishing programmes in conjunction with local industry associations, local 
training institutions and international institutions.
18.Support local investors that have the financial capacity and interest to 
participate in and/or undertake petroleum exploration and production.
19.Support collaboration and synergy by government owned agencies keen to 
participate in petroleum exploration and production.20.Develop oil and gas infrastructure such as crude oil pipelines and storage 
tanks, through PPP and JV arrangements where appropriate.
21.Develop a comprehensive Oil & Gas Master Plan; intensify exploration 
activities; enhance the utilisation of local capacity in oil exploration; upgrade 
the local exploration technology; commence commercial production of 
petroleum.
22.To facilitate efficient use of capital and Government oversight, a segmented 
fiscal structure covering the upstream, midstream and downstream shall be 
adopted. The upstream shall be subject to the proposed PSC regime while 
the midstream and downstream activities shall be held in separate entities 
outside the PSC and subject to the ITA 1959 on corporate taxation 
governance principles.
23.Adopt a transfer pricing mechanism to address the possibility of tax avoidance 
by affiliated parties in the gas value chain, based on international best 
practice guidelines for transfer pricing. 
24.Provide mechanisms for commercialization of gas, taking into account 
elements of supply chain which shall consider the value of natural gas upon 
discovery, development, processing and the market for end products in order 
to determine the pricing. 
25.Undertake measures to fast track commercial gas discovery including CBM 
and Shale Gas.
26.In the event of discovery of crude oil together with natural gas, companies 
should endeavour to ensure that secondary measures are instituted to 
exhaustively produce from such wells.
27.Flaring of natural gas must be regulated by way of formulating a gas flaring 
policy and regulation.
28.Offer more favourable fiscal terms for natural gas including more favourable 
profit splits as an incentive for natural gas exploration and development.3.3 MIDSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM PETROLEUM
3.3.1 PETROLEUM DEMAND AND CONSUMPTION 
1. The average consumption of petroleum products in Papua New Guinea has 
been increasing over the years. Some of the factors that explain this 
increase in consumption include GDP growth, electrical energy demand, 
population growth, urban population growth, and increase in motorization 
and air transport. 
2. Demand for petroleum products is projected to rise in line with the boom in 
economic activities triggered from the PNG LNG project. 
3.3.2 PETROLEUM SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION
1. The world economy emerged from the recession experienced in 2009 
recording a significant growth of 4.6% in 2010. This influenced world oil 
demand and supply. 
2. In 2011 oil prices fluctuated rapidly with the lowest at US$ 95.6 in January, 
peaking in April at US$ 120 per barrel and averaging at more than US$110 
per barrel most of the year. In 2012 the average oil price went up by 3.1% to 
US$112.97 per barrel. 
3. The rapid prices changes were mainly attributed to strong global demand, 
appreciation of the dollar and the unrest in the Middle East and North Africa. 
High international oil prices and a weak Papua New Guinean Kina have led 
to spikes in prices of petroleum products in the domestic market. 
3.3.3 PETROLEUM INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES
1. Sufficient and efficient infrastructural systems are key to ensuring adequate, 
reliable and cost effective production and supply of petroleum products. The 
increase in local and regional demand for petroleum products has not been 
matched by the development of the infrastructure to meet supply chain and 
market demands. 
2. In addition, the volatile international prices of petroleum products and the 
volatile foreign exchange rates have led to unpredictable consumer prices, 
more so in the local pump prices. From 2010 the resulting cost-push 
inflation has led to unsustainable increase in the cost of living. 3.3.4 IMPORT/OFFLOADING FACILITIES IN NAPANAPA
1. PNG’s only oil refinery, the Napa Napa oil refinery, located outside of Port 
Moresby has a processing capacity of about 35, 000 barrels a day. By 
industry standards, this is a very small refinery. The refinery currently 
imports both crude oil and refined petroleum products.
2. The State would like to encourage competition in the petroleum fuels market, 
hence competition in the entire value chain of the fuels market from refinery to 
retailing will be promoted.
3. The State shall use its best endeavours to secure domestically produced 
crude as feedstock to transfer cost benefits to the national economy.
3.3.4.1 STORAGE FACILITIES IN NAPA NAPA
1. Napa Napa has a storage capacity of 750,000 barrels of crude feedstock and 
approximately 1.1 million barrels of refined products while its operational 
capacity is 36, 000 bpd. This comprises JetA1, diesel and gasoline. This 
capacity is adequate for domestic demand of petroleum products but the 
refinery currently imports some refined petroleum products as it often 
produces at below capacity.
3.3.4.2 STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVES
1. The State recognizes the critical need to put in place energy security 
mechanisms, particularly with respect to refined fuels and therefore will 
address issues pertaining to feedstock, refinery capacity, storage and 
efficiency. 
3.3.5 PETROLEUM REFINING
1. The Puma Energy-owned Napa Napa Oil refinery has been refining 36,000 
bpd of crude oil. The refinery produces Jet A-1, diesel and gasoline. The 
State is determined to encourage competition in the oil refinery sector in 
order to achieve efficiency and low unit cost of production, which should be 
transferred to the end users and this is fundamentally crucial for the 
Government in growing the national economy.
2. The State would encourage local refineries to purchase domestically 
produced crude and that the price of feedstock crude shall be equivalent to 
cost of production and transportation plus a 10 percent margin.3.3.6 PETROLEUM TRANSPORTATION
3.3.6.1 PIPELINE
1. Oil and Gas pipeline as well as processing and storage facilities are very 
important national infrastructure.
2. The Government will encourage third party access in major oil and gas 
pipelines, particularly pipelines which have a capacity of 30 inches and over, 
hence a project developer must make provision for excess capacity to be 
made available in the system.
3.3.6.2 SEA TRANSPORT
1. PNG’s LNG sector has a huge potential for expansion and the Government’s 
desire is to maximise PNG’s benefits by encouraging State Owned 
Companies and Nationally Owned Companies to participate in each segment 
of the LNG value chain, including LNG tankers.
2. Being a marine nation, sea transport is a vital part of life in PNG and the 
Government’s desire is to create an environment where the cost structure of 
business in PNG is reduced, including the cost of sea transportation.
3.3.6.3 ROAD TRANSPORT
1. Road transport will continue to play a vital role in the distribution of petroleum 
refined fuels in PNG and the Government recognizes the importance of 
making transportation less costly by addressing elements which add to 
increased cost of business such as bad roads and high cost of fuel. 
3.3.7 OIL MARKETING COMPANIES (OMC)
1. Puma Energy, since taking over InterOil’s refining assets in Papua New 
Guinea, is the major licensed OMC allowed to import and market crude and 
petroleum products in Papua New Guinea. There are two more OMCs in the 
market, Niugini Oil Company and Mobil Oil Limited.
2. InterOil retail and wholesale distribution business distributes diesel, jet fuel, 
gasoline, kerosene and fuel oil as well as Shell and BP branded commercial 
and industrial lubricants such as engine and hydraulic oils.3. Both Mobil and InterOil own and operate large terminals and depots 
throughout Papua New Guinea. InterOil supplies the aviation companies.
4. In addition to their wholesale distribution networks, both Mobil and InterOil 
run retail service stations networks throughout the country.
5. InterOil owned eleven (11) airfield operations in Papua New Guinea located 
on or adjacent to the airstrip. Customers include the following; the National 
Government carrier, commercial passenger airlines, mining and exploration 
and independent airlines operators.
6. The current Service Agreement between Puma Energy and GoPNG is under 
review to allow in additional competitors. 
7. The Government endeavours to create an environment of level playing field 
for OMCs to compete fairly so that the market forces of supply and demand 
will set the true economic price for refined petroleum products.
3.3.8 REGULATED INDUSTRY/REGULATORY CONTRACTS
1. The retailed petroleum refined fuels market is regulated but there are 
imbalances in the market, hence making the cost of fuel in PNG very 
expensive.
2. The Government is determined to ensure the market is regulated properly in 
a manner where both the suppliers are able to make a reasonable return in 
their investment while the consumers, including the PNG economy and 
ordinary citizens, including SMEs benefit from low unit cost of fuels.
3.3.9 GLOBAL GEO-POLITICAL ISSUES
1. On the international scene, crude oil prices have been on a continuous and 
gradual increase and sometimes abrupt fluctuations. There are a number of 
geo-political issues that affect the oil prices in the international scene not 
only in recent years but also in the past. The recent plummeting in crude oil 
prices, are in one way or another influenced by factors or events such as the 
unrests in the Middle East countries, reduction in production by OPEC, 
piracy in the Indian Ocean, increased tension between the USA and Russia 
over the Ukrainian/Russian conflict, increased demand for petroleum 
products worldwide, foreign exchange fluctuations and fluctuations in the
USA strategic reserves.2. This fluctuation of the international prices has been causing a shock to the 
domestic oil prices. 
3. The imported petroleum products are paid for in US Dollars. Fluctuation of 
the exchange rate against the US Dollar shows an overall gradual 
depreciation. The depreciation of the Papua New Guinea Kina against US 
Dollar negates any drop in international crude oil prices and makes imports 
more expensive. 
4. Other major costs that impact consumer prices are taxes and levies on 
petroleum products.
5. Other costs which have increased are the transportation and distribution 
costs and the allowed marketer’s margin to cover overheads and profit. 
3.3.10 CHALLENGES IN THE MID AND DOWNSTREAM PETROLEUM
1. Out-dated refinery: 
(a) Higher than normal fuel and loss performance because of Tops recirculation;
(b) Programme yield is based on test run conditions (i.e. under controlled 
condition for a day, neat crude processing and without any upsets) which may 
not ordinarily be achieved.
(c) High sulphur levels have adverse impacts on the environment and health. 
Diesel sulphur specification is becoming stringent world-wide for cleaner 
environment. 
2. Frequent power interruptions.
3. Inadequate infrastructure for storage and evacuation of petroleum products.
4. High initial cost of acquiring the necessary infrastructure.
5. Lack of proper planning and coordination of petroleum infrastructure.
6. Lack a petroleum (oil and gas) master plan.
7. Whereas spot buying has various advantages, it exposes the country to price 
volatility and unreliability as opposed to long term supply contracts which 
come with price stability and reliability. 8. Inadequate competition.
9. High prices of petroleum products.
10.Adulteration of petroleum products. 
11.Lack of centralized gas reticulation infrastructure to homes. 
3.3.11 STRATEGIES IN MIDSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM PETROLEUM 
1. Necessary amendments to be made to the existing legislations (especially Oil 
and Gas Act and the ICCC Act) governing hydro carbons to ensure that no 
vertical integration takes place in the investment, extraction, distribution and 
transportation of hydrocarbons.
2. Provide a legal and regulatory framework for midstream petroleum and gas 
Infrastructure including third party access at reasonable terms and conditions.
3. Government to co-ordinate energy infrastructure development which are 
interlinked to facilitate efficient utilization of petroleum resources.
4. Establish a one stop source of petroleum upstream licensing and operations 
to be known as the Petroleum Resources Authority. It will be the overall 
Regulator of the Industry.
5. Facilitate NPCP’s role of stabilizing the market/prices by using appropriate 
measures including market presence and importation of at least 30% of the 
country’s demand.
6. Introduce incentives to attract investment in retail networks in the remote 
areas of the country.
7. Enhance consumption of LPG, being an environmentally friendly and 
economic modern fuel by:
(a) Constructing import handling, storage, and distribution facilities. 
(b) Providing fiscal incentives on LPG and related appliances. 
(c) Encouraging private sector investment in additional capacity for 
handling and storage of LPG.8. Enforce minimum construction and operation standards for retail and 
wholesale dispensing sites.
9. Creation and Provision for Strategic Petroleum Reserves in the Oil & Gas Act
1998.
10.Enhancing security of supply of petroleum products by raising the operational 
stock level from 21 to 30 days consumption after construction of additional 
storage tanks.
11.Provide appropriate incentives to facilitate and support public and private 
investments in the development of petroleum infrastructure including 
petroleum jetties, gas filling terminals, loading and storage facilities in all parts 
of the country at least cost.
12.Construct petroleum storage facilities at appropriate locations to meet 30 days 
of operational stocks and 90 days of strategic reserve stocks.
13.Petroleum products quality to be reviewed occasionally to align them with 
international standards by enhancing institutional capacity in Papua New 
Guinea National Institute of Standards & Industrial Technology (NISIT) to 
enforce compliance with fuel quality specifications for both domestic import 
and export market.
14.The Government shall facilitate NPCP to procure the ninety days petroleum 
strategic reserve stock.
15.The Government shall fast track the development of new refineries to 
enhance petroleum refinery capacity in the country.
16.The Government shall facilitate and support public and private investments in 
off-loading, storage, transportation and evacuation infrastructure for adequate 
supply and distribution of petroleum products.
17.The Government shall establish mechanisms to ensure stable power supply 
to support petroleum business.
18.Government shall where necessary cushion Papua New Guinean consumers 
from the negative effect of high petroleum prices.19.Assess the continuing feasibility of pump price regulation.
20.Introduce measures to increase consumption of LPG.
21.Provide incentives for investment in centralized gas reticulation systems.
22.Transportation of petroleum products by road to be restricted where other 
cheaper and safer modes of transportation are available.
23.The government shall put enabling mechanisms to allow NPCP apply its 
expertise regionally in petroleum infrastructure development.
3.4 MID AND DOWNSTREAM NATURAL GAS
3.4.1 BACKGROUND
1. Natural gas has the potential of meeting future energy needs of the country 
and offers a number of significant environmental benefits over other fossil 
fuels mainly due to its chemical simplicity that burns cleaner than all other 
fossil fuels. 
2. The country could harness some of the indigenous gas to meet the growing 
energy requirements of the country and would seek to reduce reliance on 
imports. 
3. The monetization of natural gas is frequently more complex than the 
commercialization of hydrocarbon liquid reserves as demonstrated in the 
PNG LNG Project. Frequently investments will be required in interrelated 
links in the supply chain, including upstream, midstream, downstream and 
consumption facilities.
3.4.2 UTILIZATION
1. Electric Power Generation: The main use of natural gas is through gasfired power generation, preferably Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGT) to 
ensure maximum efficiency. Generation of power through gas fired plants 
has several advantages over other fossil fuelled power plants in that it has 
much lower environmental impact. Natural gas pipeline would need to be constructed from the field to the power plant or from the LNG import handling 
facility or import pipeline. 
2. Industrial: The following industries are feasible when sufficient quantities of 
natural gas are available at reasonable cost: 
a. Manufacture of ammonia for fertilizer production. More than 97% of the 
world’s strategic fertilizer is produced from synthetically produced 
ammonia derived from natural gas. The natural gas is both a feedstock 
and fuel. 
b. Manufacture of fuel additives, plastics detergents, formaldehyde, among 
others. 
c. Manufacture of steel through the modern Direct Reduced Iron method 
which directly removes oxygen by reacting the ore with a hydrogen-rich 
and CO-rich gas produced by catalysing methane derived from natural 
gas. The natural gas is both a feedstock and fuel. 
3. Gas to Liquids: This application is used to produce diesel and other fuels. 
However the technology for Gas to Liquids (GTL) has not yet been 
commercially proven and therefore shall not be an option until such 
technologies are well developed and available at reasonable cost. 
4. Transport: Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) is methane pressured at 200 to 
250 bars (2900 to 3,500 psi) at which it is stored and distributed. In this 
case, Methane is compressed to less than 1% of the volume it occupies at 
standard atmospheric pressure. CNG technology shall be applied in Papua 
New Guinea for transport.
5. Commercial and domestic use: The Government shall initiate pilot projects 
for residential domestic and commercial purposes for space heating, water 
heating, cooking, and street lighting. Networks shall be developed for 
supplying residential and commercial consumers with clean and reliable 
natural gas. 
3.4.3 CHALLENGES
1. Lack of legal regulatory and fiscal framework to facilitate the export options as 
the easiest and quickest option to monetize natural gas discoveries. 
2. Lack of facilities to exploit natural gas reserves, e.g., power plants, 
petrochemical plants, and fertilizer plants. 3. Lack of infrastructure for supply to commercial, industrial and residential 
consumers.
4. Lack of gas master plan. 
3.4.4 STRATEGIES – MID AND DOWNSTREAM NATURAL GAS
1. Necessary amendments to be made to the existing legislations (especially Oil 
and Gas Act and the ICCC Act) governing hydro carbons to ensure that no 
vertical integration takes place in the investment, extraction, distribution and 
transportation of hydrocarbons.
2. Develop a Gas Master Plan and a policy that identifies priority domestic 
sectors for gas utilization and, provided sufficient volumes are discovered, will 
allow gas to be separated and exported at international market prices.
3. Develop a Standard Gas Project Agreement template.
4. Develop the gas sector by: ensuring the safe supply of gas to end users; 
attracting investment in the sector by establishing a transparent and efficient 
legislative framework; promoting private sector participation in all parts of the 
gas chain and establishing a regulatory framework ((Economic Regulation, 
Negotiated Access and Operational Regulation (ERNADOR)) according to 
international norms.
5. Adopt a segmented fiscal structure covering the upstream, midstream and 
downstream segments to facilitate efficient use of capital and Government 
oversight.
6. Facilitate industries to exploit supplies of natural gas based on market studies 
of priority markets.
7. Initiate networks to supply residential and commercial consumers with clean 
and reliable natural gas.
8. For Gas to Liquids (GTL) the policy shall be to allow the technology to be 
commercially proven before adoption locally.9. CNG technology shall be applied for transport starting with public transport 
initially on pilot basis in areas with supply of natural gas.
10.Carry out studies for overall gas demand in the country to facilitate planning.
11.Establish a regulatory framework for the midstream and downstream natural 
gas sector.
12.Develop the Domestic Gas Reservation (DGR) Policy.
3.5 COAL RESOURCES
3.5.1 OVERVIEW
1. Coal has been identified as one of the indigenous sources of energy that will 
drive the development of strategic initiatives for Vision 2050. It was 
recognized that the key to increased development lay in early identification of 
indigenous energy sources, exploiting them and establishing an appropriate 
institutional framework for their delivery to consumers. 
2. Coal is a readily combustible rock containing more than 50% by weight and 
more than 70% by volume of carbonaceous material formed from compaction 
of variously altered plant remains. It is used as a source of energy, mainly for 
electricity generation. It is the most affordable fuel worldwide and has a 
potential to become the most reliable and easily accessible energy source.
3. The introduction of clean coal technology (CCTs) in coal fired power plants 
reduces emissions and extracts sulphur for other applications such as 
chemical and fertilizer production while capturing carbon for storage (CCS). 
Current world coal energy consumption by sector is 42% electricity, 25% 
industrial and 4% other uses.
4. The country has adequate coal deposits for commercial exploitation and the 
Government is fast tracking exploration and development of the resource for 
power generation and industrial use.
5. Interest in coal has also increased recently in Papua New Guinea, with 
prospectors snapping up dozens of new coal exploration permits starting in 
early 2011. Australian based Waterford is investigating coal shale long the 
Sepik and the Ramu basin in the northeast of the country, while other 
attention has also been shown in the Gulf basin in the southwest. Having completed initial exploratory efforts, the results are now being analysed and 
expected to be submitted to the Mineral Resources Authority (MRA) by mid2012.
3.5.2 DEMAND FOR COAL
1. In Papua New Guinea, there is a demand for coal for cheap and alternative 
electricity generation. Coal has been considered an alternative option for 
base-load electricity generation in PNG, and thus its domestic demand is 
expected to rise with introduction of the technology.
2. Domestic consumption is expected with the discovery of coal deposits by 
Mayur Resources2, in the Gulf Province and other parts of the country.
3.5.3 COAL UPSTREAM DEVELOPMENT
1. There are commercially viable coal reserves in the Gulf Province.
2. Coal reserves there are yet to be confirmed. 
3. Further exploration for coal is being carried out in other parts of the country.
3.5.4 CHALLENGES IN COAL EXPLORATION
1. Limited skills and expertise in core drilling disciplines. 
2. Limited coal reserve data due to low intensity of exploration.
3. Poor infrastructure; coal resources are mostly situated in remote areas where 
there is lack of developed road, water, communication and electricity.
4. Lack of interest by major coal exploration companies due to limited technical 
data.
5. Absence of a legal, fiscal and regulatory framework for coal exploration, 
exploitation and development.
 
2 Mayur Resources is a privately held company with one of the largest tenement holdings in PNG; this 
comprises a pipeline of exploration and development projects, across a diversified portfolio including 
Coal, Iron sands, Copper & Gold.6. Lack of a special purpose vehicle to spearhead exploration, assessment and 
development of coal resources. 
3.5.5 COAL MID AND DOWNSTREAM DEVELOPMENT
1. There are no coal fired power plant in the Papua New Guinea as yet.
2. The Government will encourage clean-energy technology for the development 
and consumption of coal in the country.
3.5.6 CHALLENGES IN COAL MID AND DOWNSTREAM 
1. Inadequate technical capacity for coal mid and downstream activities. 
2. Absence of a standard import and export coal handling facilities.
3. Underdeveloped road transportation system.
4. Undeveloped processing facilities for coal.
5. Insufficient power supply in the coal field.
6. Undeveloped capacity to store and evacuate coal products.
7. High initial cost of acquiring the necessary infrastructure. 
8. High transportation cost from the processor to end user.
3.5.7 STRATEGIES - COAL (UPSTREAM, MIDSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM)
1. Necessary amendments to be made to the existing legislations (especially Oil 
and Gas Act and the ICCC Act) governing hydro carbons to ensure that no 
vertical integration takes place in the investment, extraction, distribution and 
transportation of hydrocarbons.
2. Develop a standard Model Mining Development Contract (MMDC) and or 
alternatively Mining Code for Coal (MCC) and other minerals.
3. Continuation of resource development agreements/mining development 
contracts but with fiscal terms taken out and included in general legislation.4. Cash bidding for unallocated, relinquished and surrendered exploration 
acreage.
5. Contracting out early-stage geological survey work, financed out of proceeds 
of cash bidding for exploration acreage.
6. Develop local expertise and enhance local content in coal exploration and
production through training and collaboration with exploration companies, 
training and research institutions.
7. Create appropriate legal, fiscal and regulatory framework for coal exploration, 
exploitation and development.
8. Establish coal energy research centre within the proposed national energy 
institute capable of handling coal analysis and other related studies.
9. Adapt clean coal technology and provide appropriate fiscal incentives.
10.Create new coal exploration blocks based on technical data.
11.Enhance regional co-operation in data and information exchange for coal 
exploration.
12.Papua New Guinea’s State Owned Entities shall maximise the utilisation of 
available transport modes and do the feasibility of Rail Transport for 
transportation of coal products.
13.Enhance budgetary support for exploration and development of coal 
resources.
14.Encourage private sector participation in coal exploration, mining, 
development and use through PPP and JV arrangements by providing 
appropriate incentives.
15.Construct necessary infrastructure to support coal industry, including 
provision for handling import and export of coal.
16.Intensify coal exploration activities by upgrading exploration technology and 
mobilizing resources.17.Facilitate development of 10MW coal fired plant in Port Moresby, and 
development of other coal fired plants in other feasible sites in the country.
18.Develop an integrated infrastructure for coal storage, transportation and 
utilization to facilitate development of the coal industry.
19.Incentivize Provincial and Local Level Governments with coal deposits to 
develop infrastructure to potential coal mining sites to encourage investments 
in coal mining.
 
20.Put in place mechanisms of sharing of revenue to ensure that the local 
community benefit from the development of the resource.
21.Ensure compliance with the best coal industry practice in exploration, mining, 
processing, development and rehabilitation.
22.Ensure that all coal development activities are clearly documented and 
communicated to the Chief Secretary and the respective Provincial and Local 
Level Governments.
3.5.8 CROSS CUTTING STRATEGIES IN FOSSIL FUELS
1. Adopt and implement the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) 
principles (governance, increasing scrutiny over revenue collection from oil 
and gas) as a demonstration of its commitment to good as well coal 
resources, and improving the country’s investment climate.
2. Enhance infrastructure development for fossil fuels.
3. Adopt clean technologies in exploration, exploitation and development of 
fossil fuels.
4. Develop frameworks and methodologies for determining the oil, gas and coal 
resource reserves, reporting fossil fuel discoveries and provide penalties for 
falsification of data.
5. Government shall classify strategic energy installations such as oil and gas 
fields, coal mines, refineries, jetties, pipeline systems, petroleum, storage facilities as protected areas and provide security during construction and 
operation.4 RENEWABLE ENERGY
4.1 BACKGROUND
1. Renewable energy harnesses naturally occurring non-depletable sources of 
energy, such as hydro, solar, wind, geothermal, wave, tidal, ocean current, 
biofuel and biomass, to produce electricity, gases and liquid fuels, heat or a 
combination of these energy types. Some of these renewable energies such 
as wind, biomass have been used for thousands of years.
2. Current consumer energy in PNG mostly depends on three main fuels; 
electricity, oil and biomass. In terms of primary energy supply in 2011 oil 
products accounted for approximately 57%, biomass 37% and hydro, gas and 
geothermal power the remaining 6%. The energy sector accounts for 14% of 
the country’s GDP.
3. With the developments of renewable energy technologies, these renewable 
energy sources can be used to generate electricity. Taking into account the 
sustainable character of the majority of renewable energy technologies, they 
are able to preserve resources, promote energy security and diversify energy 
supply virtually without environmental impact.
 
4. With the possibility of PNG becoming a net oil importer over the medium to 
long term, there may be considerable change in PNG’s future energy mix and 
PNG’s energy security would remain vulnerable to external shocks. However, 
the technical potential for renewable energy sources in PNG is enormous and 
the majority occurs/exists in rural areas. 
5. PNG is endowed with abundant renewable energy resources, yet 90% of the 
country’s population is without access to electricity. PNG has significant 
underutilized indigenous energy sources such hydro, natural gas, geothermal,
solar-based systems and wind, development of these resources would 
accelerate PNG’s potential to sustain economic growth and enhance the 
electrification rate. 
6. For instance, in hydro power, the potential hydroelectric resources are 
capable of generating some 15,000 MW of electricity. Less than one percent
of this 15,000MW capacity is currently utilized. Significant reforms are 
needed and specialized business entities focusing on renewable energy must 
be created to materialize the dreams of the Vision 2050. The proposed 
involvement of the state to promote renewable energy power companies through the auspices of the new Kumul Power Limited (KPL) is a stride in the 
right direction.
7. In electricity generation, utilization of hydro (mini hydro) and solar power are 
appropriate choice in off-grid and rural areas to accelerate rural electrification. 
PNG situated along the equator has abundance of sun shine all year round 
and there are high wind spots along the coastlines and the isolated islands 
that can be harnessed to produce electricity for the isolated rural communities.
8. The PNG Vision 2050 asserts that by the year 2050 PNG will be 100% 
powered by renewable energy sources, at the backdrop of our aspirational 
policy, PNG is at the crossroads and must now more than ever drive its 
attention to promote and develop our indigenous resources such as hydro, 
geothermal, natural gas, solar and wind to sustain economic growth. 
9. Perhaps the jewel in the crown of infrastructure development and economic 
growth is the potential to develop Purari Hydro Power Project to produce low 
cost energy to drive industrial growth in the country with excess power 
supplied to neighbouring countries. The feasibility studies identified Wabo as 
the preferred site for the construction of the dam with a capacity to produce up 
to 2,500 MW of power. This level of generation has the potential to propel 
industrial development in PNG, supply consumers in Port Moresby and the 
Ramu power systems as well as the potential to export excess power to 
Australia and Indonesia. However, it might be the most expensive project 
ever undertaken in PNG.
10.These new renewable energy power companies will operate under the 
following share arrangement; State 60%, respective Provincial Government 
30% and Landowners 10%. The intent is to promote landowner participation 
and ownership in resource development.
11.The recent launch of the National Biofuel Policy Consultation workshop in 
2014 and the drive to develop a Biofuel Policy by the Department of Public 
Enterprises (DPE) is also a step in the right direction to meaningfully utilise 
PNG’s renewable energy resources under the auspices of the governments 
‘Green Growth Strategy’. The workshop findings revealed that the growth of 
biofuels in PNG in recent years has been spurred by increasing prices of fossil 
fuels, the need to survive financially in business, environmental concerns and 
unreliable supply of energy. Biofuels are also viewed as a potential means to 
stimulate rural development and create employment opportunities. The thrust of the Biofuel Policy would be to facilitate and bring about optimal 
development and utilization of indigenous biomass feedstock for production of 
biofuels.
4.2 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY
4.2.1 BACKGROUND
1. Below the earth's crust, there is a layer of hot and molten rock called 
magma. Heat is continually produced there, mostly from the decay of 
naturally radioactive materials such as uranium and potassium. The amount 
of heat within 10,000 metres of the earth's surface contains 50,000 times 
more energy than all the oil and natural gas resources in the world.
Four types of geothermal energy are usually distinguished:
a. Hydrothermal – Hot water or steam at moderate depths (100 – 4500 
meters.
b. Geopressed – Hot water aquifers containing dissolved methane 
under high pressure at depths of 3-6kilometers.
c. Hot dry rock – Abnormally hot geologic formations with little or no 
water.
d. Magma – Molten rock at temperatures of 700 – 1200 degrees 
celcius.
Nowadays only hydrothermal resources are used on a commercial scale for 
electricity generation and as a direct heat source.
2. The areas with the highest underground temperatures are in regions with 
active or geological young volcanoes. These occur at plate boundaries or at 
places where the crust is thin enough to let the heat through.
3. Papua New Guinea is situated on the “Pacific Ring of Fire”, a seismically 
active zone. Known active seismic zones are in the New Guinea Islands 
Region and the Northern Coast of the Mainland. The Gazelle Peninsula and 
Talasea are known areas for geothermal activity. Incidentally they also 
contain viable commercial quantities of geothermal energy reserves. 
4. The only commercially known use of this energy source in the country is on 
Lihir Island where a plant uses the energy to supply power to the mining 
operations at the Lihir Gold Mine. 5. Geothermal power plants use steam or hot water from a natural underground 
reservoir to generate electrical energy and heat for other industrial 
applications. Other uses of geothermal energy include: 
(a) Dairy industry - refrigeration and pasteurization of milk products; 
(b) Grain Silos - drying of grains (wheat & maize) and other farm products 
such as pyrethrum; 
(c) Space heating and cooling - green houses, residential houses, hotels 
and other buildings; 
(d) Industry - production of industrial sulphur, treatment of hides and skins 
and honey processing, and 
(e) Water heating for fish and crocodile farming, and spas/swimming pool. 
6. The specific details of the Geothermal Energy will be captured in the 
Renewable Energy Policy to be produced by the Institution mandated to draw 
up this sectoral policy.
4.2.2 CHALLENGES
1. Relatively long lead time of between 5-7 years from conception to production 
of electricity. 
2. Geothermal projects typically progress through stages of reconnaissance, 
surface exploration, feasibility study, exploratory drilling, appraisal drilling, 
production drilling, steam field development and power plant construction 
stages which normally involve high upfront investment costs. 
3. High resource development risks. 
4. Inadequate geothermal expertise and expensive external technology. 
5. Remote location, siting restrictions and long distances to existing load centres 
necessitating heavy investment in transmission and other support 
infrastructure. 
6. Competing and conflicting interests in use of land and natural energy 
resources by various sectors of the economy. 7. Relocation and resettlement of affected persons during geothermal 
development. 
4.2.3 STRATEGIES - GEOTHERMAL ENERGY
1. The PNG Government shall support and fund the Geothermal Development 
Company (GEODEVCO) so as to manage the geothermal exploration risk and 
attract investors.
2. The Government shall draft a new legislation specifically to regulate 
Geothermal Energy.
3. The Government shall develop a Geothermal Policy as a matter of urgency 
and align it with this Energy Policy.
4. The Government will continue to support and facilitate the public sector as 
well as encourage the private sector to invest in geothermal subsector through 
various means including PPP and joint venture arrangements. 
5. The government will promote research development and dissemination and 
capacity building for geothermal development through provision of fiscal and 
other incentives. 
6. The government shall streamline licensing and allocations of geothermal.
7. Promote and encourage direct uses of geothermal resources such as 
utilization of heat, water, gases and minerals. 
8. Utilize the best available technologies that optimise the resource and 
conserve the reservoir such as binary generation and bottoming cycles.
9. The developer of a geothermal field shall guarantee geothermal steam supply 
for the contract term of the plant. 
10.Promote early geothermal generation through implementation of efficient 
modular geothermal wellhead technologies. 11.Undertake further geothermal resource assessments to determine additional 
economically viable geothermal resources. 
12.Increase Government allocation of funds for the geothermal programme and 
support GEODEVCO in sourcing more funds. 
4.3 HYDRO ENERGY
4.3.1 BACKGROUND
1. Hydropower is electricity generated using the energy of moving water. Rain 
or melted snow, usually originating in hills and mountains, create streams 
and rivers that eventually run to lakes, seas or oceans. This energy has 
been exploited for centuries. In the late 19th century, hydropower became a 
source for generating electricity. 
2. A typical hydro plant is a system with three parts: an electric plant where the 
electricity is produced; a dam that can be opened or closed to control water 
flow; and a reservoir where water can be stored. The amount of electricity 
that can be generated depends on how far the water drops and how much 
water moves through the system. 
3. Hydropower is, to date, the most successful form of renewable energy. The 
amount of electrical energy generated depends upon the quantity of 
available water. Adverse hydrology can have a devastating effect on an 
economy that is heavily dependent on hydropower. 
4. Papua New Guinea has an estimated hydropower potential of about 15, 000
MW comprising of large hydros (sites with capacity of more than 10MW) 
and small hydros.
5. There are 4 major Drainage Basins in the Country; the Strickland-Purari, 
Fly, Ramu and Sepik River Drainage Basins. The two promising ones for 
major hydro developments are the Ramu and Strickland-Purari due to the 
geography and volume.
6. There are four major hydro power stations in Papua New Guinea, namely: 
Rouna (Port Moresby), Yonki (Kainantu), Warangoi (Gazelle) and Baiune 
(Bulolo). These hydro power stations are critical to the country’s socioeconomic well-being. 4.3.2 LARGE HYDROS
4.3.3 BACKGROUND
1. PNG has significant potential in large hydro based power generation, given 
its high rainfall and many large fast flowing rivers systems.
2. There are 4 major Drainage Basins in the Country; the Strickland-Purari, Fly, 
Ramu and Sepik River Drainage Basins. The two promising ones for major 
hydro developments are the Ramu and Strickland-Purari due to the 
geography and volume.
3. The Government will continue to promote and encourage feasibility studies 
to develop large hydro potential in the country.
4. The specific details of Hydro Energy as a Renewable Energy resource will 
be captured in the Renewable Energy Policy to be produced by the 
Institution mandated to draw up this sectoral policy.
4.3.4 CHALLENGES
1. Hydropower is vulnerable to variations in hydrology and climate. This is a big 
challenge as poor rains results in power and energy shortfalls, reducing the 
contribution of hydro power in the energy mix. 
2. The economic risk in hydropower projects is relatively higher than other 
modes of electricity generation because they are capital intensive and wholly 
dependent on hydrology. 
3. A major challenge for hydro power projects is relocation and resettlement of 
affected persons given PNG’s customary land tenure arrangement.
4. Long lead time of between 7-10 years. 
5. Insufficient hydrological data throughout Papua New Guinea. It does not 
capture quality nor cover required periods of at least 50 years.
6. Water charges that have an effect of increasing the cost of hydro generated 
electricity. 
7. Conflicting and competing land and water uses between various sub-sectors 
of the economy with regard to development and utilization of the same for 
electricity generation. 
8. Ownership of physical dam reservoirs which have stifled redevelopment. 4.3.5 STRATEGIES – LARGE HYDROS
1. Develop a hydro risk mitigation to address risks such as prolonged droughts 
so as to cushion generators, transmitters, distributors and consumers against 
effects of adverse hydrology. 
2. Address competing interests in the use of water resources for large 
hydropower generation and other purposes. 
3. Establish an inter-departmental committee comprising of relevant 
stakeholders to advise policy direction on ownership and management of 
dams. 
4. Energy conservation and efficiency will be promoted in the design of 
hydropower plants.
5. Environmental conservation of catchment areas will be promoted to mitigate 
soil erosion and land use practices which do not aggravate the top soil and 
cause rapid siltation of dams and river systems. The developer shall be 
responsible for funding the initiative. Where possible use other alternate 
hydro generation technologies (provide suitable technology).
6. The Government shall, where possible implement hydro power projects as 
multi- purpose projects. Consideration will also be given to leasing of such 
projects for operation through long-term concessions. 
7. The private sector will be encouraged through Feed-in-Tariff to develop 
potential sites to generate electricity for their own consumption and for export 
of any surplus to the national grid and neighbouring countries. Government 
will provide letters of comfort to investors which guarantee purchase of 
electrical energy on just and reasonable terms.
8. Provide necessary support for raising of Purari dam and other large scale 
hydropower projects.
9. Undertake pre-investment studies on hydro resources to define their 
technical and economic viability.
10.Adequately fund the PNG Dams Limited to be the SPV/SOE to cater for large 
dams. Installed

4.3.6 SMALL HYDROS
4.3.7 BACKGROUND
1. Classification of hydro by sizes (MW) varies in jurisdictions. Therefore, for our 
purposes, we categorise most hydro systems within Papua New Guinea to fall 
under the category of small hydro. Small hydro can range from generating 
capacity up to 10MW or further subdivided into mini hydro, less than 1000 kW 
and micro hydro, less than 100 kW.
2. PNG’s system comprise several small to medium scale hydro ranging from 
0.8 MW to 58 MW. Tables 1 and 2 below shows existing and propose hydro 
developments.

3. PNG has significant hydroelectric potential with vast river, numerous creeks, 
streams and mountain spring water flows throughout the country that can be 
harnessed to produce hydroelectricity power for the rural population of PNG.4. The specific details of Small Hydros as a Renewable Energy resource will 
be captured in the Renewable Energy Policy to be produced by the 
Institution mandated to draw up this sectoral policy.
4.3.8 GOVERNMENT ACTIONS
1. The upsurge in demand for electrical energy in PNG fuelled by high 
economic growth provides an exciting potential for investment in the small 
hydro sector. This Government will endeavour to:
a. Promote investment in the infrastructure sector both new and 
existing.
b. Provide adequate financial resources and technical capacity to 
carry out feasibility studies and development of sites.
c. Promote collection and processing of hydrological database.
d. Mitigate and address competing interests between stakeholder’s
sites (landowner issues).
e. Promote participation in all power infrastructure projects.
4.3.9 STRATEGIES – SMALL HYDROS
1. Promote protection of the environment and catchment areas.
2. Provide incentives for public private partnerships and increase funding.
3. Promote small micro-enterprises through fiscal incentives to reduce small 
hydro’s start-up costs.
4. Create awareness and disseminate information on the benefits of small 
hydros and its coexistence with other usages of the resource.

appropriate technologies.
6. Provide incentives to promote the local production and use of efficient small 
hydro power systems.
7. Formulate and enforce standards, legal and regulatory regimes for small 
hydros.4.4 BIOMASS
4.4.1 BACKGROUND
1. Biomass is organic matter that can be used to provide heat, make fuel and 
generate electricity. Wood-fuel, the largest source of biomass has been 
used to provide heat for thousands of years. Many other types of biomass 
are also used as an energy source such as plant residue from agriculture or 
forestry and the organic component of municipal and industrial wastes. 
Landfill gas is also considered a biomass source. Biomass resources can 
be replenished through cultivation of crops such as fast growing trees and 
grass. 
2. Biomass fuels are the most important source of primary energy in Papua 
New Guinea with wood-fuel (firewood and charcoal) being the predominant 
consumer energy fuel. 
3. In spite of past efforts to promote wood fuel substitutes, the number of 
people relying on wood fuel is not decreasing. Consequently, wood fuel will 
continue to be the primary source of energy for the majority of the rural 
population and urban poor for as long as it takes to transform the rural 
economy from subsistence to a highly productive economy. 
4. Wood fuel supply management is crucial to ensure sustainable supply to 
meet the growing demand. Key issues here include: competing land use 
activities, the growing imbalance between supply and demand and the 
attendant adverse environmental as well as related land and tree tenure 
issues, among others.
5. The specific details of Biomass as a Renewable Energy resource will be 
captured in the Renewable Energy Policy to be produced by the Institution
mandated to draw up this sectoral policy.
4.4.2 CHALLENGES
1. Unsustainable use of biomass with attendant negative impacts on the 
environment, leading to serious climate variability and unpredictability in 
rainfall patterns. 
2. Emissions from wood fuel in poorly ventilated houses leading to health 
hazards among users. 3. Lack of appropriate legal and regulatory framework for sustainable production, 
distribution and marketing of biomass. 
4. Insufficient awareness of fast maturing tree growing for fuel as a commercially 
viable business. 
5. Inadequate data on biomass production and consumption. 
6. Disjointed approach in policy implementation by the various ministries and 
organizations responsible for biomass energy use. 
7. Inadequate recognition of biomass as a source of energy, despite its 
predominance in the energy mix. 
8. Use of inefficient technologies in production, conversion and consumption of 
biomass energy. 
9. Limited awareness programs aimed at encouraging investment in renewable 
energy. 
10. Competing interests over land use between biomass plantations, food 
production and other commercial uses. 
4.4.3 STRATEGIES– BIOMASS
1. The Government shall draft a new legislation specifically to regulate 
Renewable Energy.
2. The Government shall formulate a National Renewable Policy as a matter of 
urgency and align it with this Energy Policy.
3. Undertake a comprehensive base line study on biomass energy resources 
and potential, and establish status of tree cover in PNG.
4. Develop and maintain a database on biomass energy resources and potential 
in PNG.
5. Formulate and implement a national strategy for coordinating subsistence and 
commercial biomass production. 
7. Promote and update standards for efficient conversion and cleaner utilization 
of biomass including cleaner charcoal and wood burning stoves. 8. Promote Research, Development and Dissemination (RD&D) of biomass 
energy technologies. 
9. Undertake capacity building for biomass energy technologies
10.Provide incentives for private sector participation in generation, exploitation, 
production, distribution, supply and use of biomass energy. 
11.Enhance public participation in the management, protection and conservation 
of the environment
12.Promote alternative sources of energy and technologies such as biogas and 
solar as a substitute for biomass.
13.Collaborate with other relevant ministries and other stakeholders to grow and 
sustain tree cover to above 10%.
14.Collaborate with other stakeholders to ensure efficient use of land resource to 
minimize the adverse effects arising from competition for land use between 
biomass energy and food production.
15.Identify and reserve land for use in biomass energy production and undertake 
awareness programmes to sensitize the public on the importance of the 
various land uses such as for biomass, food production and other human 
needs.
16.Undertake studies to identify and promote the most appropriate biomass 
energy conversion technologies and implement the recommendations.
17.Promote inter-fuel substitution to reduce the over reliance on wood fuel.
18.Strengthen existing Energy Centres and establish others to cover all 
provinces with a view to promote efficient biomass energy use.
19.Promote the use of biomass briquettes as alternatives to wood fuel and 
kerosene in cooking, water heating and steam generation.
20.Undertake a comprehensive study on the viability of use of renewable sources 
with a view to eliminating use of kerosene in households.21.Prepare, review and update biomass energy development plans.
4.5 BIO FUELS
4.5.1 BACKGROUND
1. Unlike other renewable sources, biomass can be converted directly into liquid 
fuels called biofuels to meet energy needs. 
2. The use of bio-fuels would reduce vehicle emissions and save on foreign 
exchange required for importing petroleum fuel, improve on the balance of 
trade and create employment. 
3. A strategy for introduction of bio-fuel blends in the market is soon to be 
developed by the Government of Papua New Guinea in 20153.
4. Commercial extraction of biodiesel for blending has already been initiated by 
several private companies and some institutions in PNG. 
5. Land will need to be set aside for the production of energy crops as feedstock 
for bio-fuels. This calls for the formulation of strategies to optimise land use, 
as well as to harmonise land use policies with the energy policy. Most biofuel projects underway or being planned involve sugarcane and sweet 
sorghum as the main feedstock for ethanol; and jatropha, castor and other 
vegetable oil crops such as, coconut, croton and cotton seed for biodiesel. 
6. The specific details of Biofuels as a Renewable Energy resource will be 
captured in the Renewable Energy Policy to be produced by the Institution
mandated to draw up this sectoral policy.
4.5.2 CHALLENGES
1. Insufficient feed-stocks to produce bio-fuels. 
2. Limited research data/information for the use and production of bio-fuel. 
 
3 Workshopped in 2014, the Policy and the accompanying NEC Submission is yet to be approved.3. Insufficient legal and institutional framework to support sustainable 
generation, utilisation, production, distribution, supply and use of liquid biofuels. 
4. Insufficient supply of bio-fuels for blending due to competing uses. 
5. Threat of competition over land use that could lead to food insecurity. 
6. Reliance on slow maturing crops and dependence on rain fed agriculture. 
7. Inadequate RD&D on alternative bio-fuel feed-stocks and technologies. 
8. Lack of knowledge among the public on the viability of growing crops for biofuel as a business. 
9. Illegal export and illicit use of ethanol. 
4.5.3 STRATEGIES– BIOFUELS
1. The Government shall draft a new legislation specifically to regulate 
Biofuels Energy.
2. The Government shall formulate the Biofuels Policy as a matter of urgency 
and align it with this Energy Policy.
3. Support RD&D for the cultivation of high yielding and fast maturing 
feedstock so as to enhance the production and use of liquid bio-fuels.
 
4. Review the existing legal, regulatory and institutional framework to 
enhance the sustainable generation, production, distribution, supply and 
use of liquid bio-fuels. 
5. Provide fiscal incentives for bio-fuel production projects, plant and 
equipment in so far as such products are used to meet energy demands. 
6. Collaborate with other stakeholders to ensure efficient use of land 
resources to minimize the adverse effects arising from competition for land 
use between liquid bio-fuel feedstock and food production. 7. Work with provincial governments to increase economic development 
through bio-fuel programmes. 
8. Create awareness on the importance and viability of growing bio-fuel 
feedstock among the public.
9. Promote joint venturing between Government agencies and private sector 
on the development and utilisation of bio fuels.
10.Invest in research on the production chain and sustainability of biofuels 
particularly biodiesel. 
11.Facilitate farmers to access cheap farm inputs and high yielding fast 
maturing bio-fuel feedstock.
12.Undertake a comprehensive study on the viability of bio-fuels and map out 
potential bio-fuels production feedstock across all provinces.
13.Provide fiscal incentives for bio-fuel production plant and equipment in so 
far as such entities are marketing the products solely for blending.
14.Government to identify and set aside land in potential locations for piloting 
of bio-fuel feedstock production.
15.Review the feasibility of gasohol and biodiesel production. 
16.Pilot a 10% ethanol-gasoline (E-10 Mandate) blend in Government vehicles 
and in public transport vehicles.
17.Pilot 1% biodiesel blend in Government vehicles and in different blending 
ratios for use as hybrid fuel at isolated power generation plants.
18.Develop a blueprint and road map for national bio-fuel implementation 
programme.
19.Use annual Agricultural Show in Lae for trade fairs, workshops seminars and 
energy centres to demonstrate and disseminate information on the 
importance and viability of growing biofuel feedstock among the public.20.The Government to enter into PPP arrangements with the private sector 
entities to accelerate the development of bio-fuels.
21.All gasoline vehicles in PNG to be using at least 10% ethanol gasoline (E-10 
Mandate) blend.
22.Provide incentives to encourage all diesel vehicles in the country to use at 
least 5% biodiesel.
4.6 BIO GAS
4.6.1 BACKGROUND
1. Any gas fuel derived from the decay of organic matter, as the mixture of 
methane and carbon dioxide produced by the bacterial decomposition of 
sewage, manure, garbage, or plant crops.
2. Biogas is considered to be a renewable source of energy. Since it often 
produced from materials that form sewage and waste products, the only time 
it will be depleted is when we stop producing any waste.
3. It is also considered to be non-polluting in nature. The production of biogas 
does not require oxygen, which means that resources are conserved by not 
using any further fuel.
4. It also uses up waste material found in landfills, dump sites and even farms 
across the country, allowing for decreased soil and water pollution.
5. Applications for biogas are increasing as the technology to utilize it gets 
better. It can be used to produce electricity and for the purpose of heating and 
cooking as well. Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) is biogas that has been 
compressed and can be used as a fuel for vehicles. Production can be carried 
out through many small plants or one large plant.
6. New Britain Palm Oil Limited and the West New Britain provincial government 
have held preliminary talks which could see electricity generated from the 
company’s waste products provided across the entire province. Figure 3
overleaf shows the Biogas collection at New Britain Palm Oil Limited’s 
operation in West New Britain.Figure 3. Biogas plant in New Britain Palm Oil’s operation.
Source: Business Advantage
7. There is a great opportunity for West New Britain to be solely powered by 
green energy in future years according to Harry Brock, General Manager of 
New Britain Palm Oil Limited (NBPOL) operations in the province.
8. If the arrangement becomes successful, the province is likely to become the 
first to use bio gas for its power generation needs.
9. The specific details of Biogas as a Renewable Energy resource will be 
captured in the Renewable Energy Policy to be produced by the Institution
mandated to draw up this sectoral policy.
4.6.2 CHALLENGES
1. Lack of information on the benefits and potential of biogas technology. 
2. Lack of RD&D on biogas emerging technologies. 
3. High upfront costs of domestic and commercial biogas plant and equipment. 
4. Inadequate skilled installation contractors in the country. 
5. Lack of post installation operation and maintenance service for plant, 
equipment and appliances.
6. Lack of clear registration and regulation guidelines for biogas installation 
contractors. 4.6.3 STRATEGIES– BIOGAS
1. The Government shall draft a new legislation specifically to regulate 
Renewable Energy.
2. The Government shall formulate a Biogas Policy as a matter of urgency and 
align it with this Energy Policy.
3. Create awareness on the benefits and potential of biogas technology.
4. Provide appropriate fiscal incentives for local manufacture as well as 
importation of biogas plant and equipment.

in institutions such village polytechnics on biogas installation, operation and 
maintenance skills. 
6. Develop guidelines for registration and regulation of biogas contractors and 
technicians. 
7. Promote domestic and community based biogas plants to cater for the urban 
poor. 
8. Promote large scale production, piping and storage of biogas.
9. Use public trade fairs, workshops, seminars and energy centres to 
demonstrate and disseminate information on the importance and viability of 
growing bio-fuel feedstock among the public.
10.Promote the use of biogas as an alternative to wood-fuel and kerosene for 
domestic and commercial energy needs.
11.Develop training programmes for biogas technologies in collaboration with 
relevant training institutions and through the energy centres.
12.Undertake a comprehensive study on the viability of bottling biogas for rural 
development. 13.Roll out biogas initiatives to supply the remaining public institutions including 
prisons, schools and hospitals as well as biogas bottling plants across PNG
4.7 SOLAR ENERGY
4.7.1 BACKGROUND
1. Solar energy is the light and heat radiated from the sun that powers earth's 
climate and supports life. The solar radiation, often called the solar resource, 
is a general term for the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the sun. Solar 
technologies allow controlled use of this energy resource. Solar radiation can 
be captured and turned into useful forms of energy, such as electricity and 
heat, using a variety of technologies. Solar energy is among the largest 
potential renewable energy resources in Papua New Guinea due to its close 
proximity to the equator where the country experience sunshine all year 
around.
2. Solar photovoltaic (PV) panels are the most common solution for harnessing 
the suns energy. The basic building block of a PV system is the solar cell. 
Thermal systems convert sunlight into thermal energy, most often providing 
heated water. 
3. Solar PV has spread gradually in PNG over the past 30 years, with small 
independent solar systems marketed by private supplies and used mainly for 
lighting, but also for communications. From 1998 – 2002 some 3000 solar 
home lighting systems were sold to individuals. The PNG Telecommunication 
Company (TPNG and or referred to alternatively as Telikom PNG) has 
hundreds of solar sites with a total capacity of over 200kWp. The expansion 
the mobile phone system into rural areas is rapidly increasing solar use for 
telecommunications and increasing demand for solar-powered phone 
chargers. A PGK 15 million (about USD 11.3 million) Japanese-supported 
project provided solar electrification for 320 schools in as much as twenty (20)
provinces of the country from 1997 – 1998, but by 2004, only a few of the 
panels installed were still operating (IRENA, 2013).
4. The PNG University of Technology (UNITECH) has supported small-scale 
applied research projects involving solar energy. The latest initiative is the 
Renewable Energy (Solar & Wind) Resource Mapping project aimed at 
determining the potentials of solar and wind energies and support its development in various locations though out PNG for both utility-scale 
generation and for village power and other off-grid applications.
5. The specific details of Solar Energy as a Renewable Energy resource will be 
captured in the Renewable Energy Policy to be produced by the Institution
mandated to draw up this sectoral policy.
4.7.2 CHALLENGES
1. Disjointed approach in policy implementation and promotion of solar energy 
projects in the PNG.
2. The percentage of solar energy harnessed for commercial and domestic 
applications is insignificant relative to the potential. 
3. Prohibitive costs of solar home systems despite favourable fiscal incentives 
and arising from lack of appropriate credit and financing mechanisms. 
4. Erosion of consumer confidence because of inappropriate system standards, 
faulty installations, importation of sub-standard systems and poor after sales 
service. 
5. Rampant theft of solar photovoltaic panels, which discourages their 
installation. 
6. Lack of awareness on the potential, opportunities and economic benefits 
offered by solar technologies. 
4.7.3 STRATEGIES– SOLAR ENERGY
1. The Government shall draft a new legislation specifically to regulate Solar
Energy.
2. The Government shall formulate the Solar Energy Policy as a matter of 
urgency and align it with this Energy Policy.
3. The Government to setup a National Energy Authority of Papua New 
Guinea.
4. Promote the wide spread use of solar energy while enforcing the existing 
regulations and standards. 5. Ensure that all commercial buildings adopt solar and hybrid solar energy 
sources for water heating and lighting. 
6. Provide incentives to promote the local production and use of efficient solar 
systems. 
7. Provide a framework for connection of electricity generated from solar 
energy to national and isolated grids, through direct sale or net metering.
8. Promote the use of hybrid power generation systems involving solar and 
other energy sources to manage the effects caused by the intermittent 
nature and availability of solar energy.

setting aside land, fast-tracking issuance of permits and licences, as well 
as acquisition of data and information so as to realise at least 100MW from 
solar by 2030.
4.8 WIND ENERGY
4.8.1 BACKGROUND
1. Wind energy uses naturally occurring energy of the wind for practical 
purposes like generating electricity, charging batteries, or pumping water. 
Large, modern wind turbines operate together in wind farms to produce 
electricity for utilities. 
2. With the rising cost of oil, exploitation of wind energy has become more 
attractive. Substitution of thermal generation with wind power plants will cut 
down on the large amounts of foreign exchange required to import fossil 
fuels for the thermal power plants. 
3. Further, partial substitution or combining wind with gen-sets (wind–diesel 
hybrid) and some form of renewable energy storage such as pumped 
storage in hydropower could cut down on running or overall costs by 
substituting renewable energy sources for significant amounts of diesel. 
4. Using wind energy to substitute thermal generation will also lead to less CO2
emissions thus contributing to reduction in global warming. The carbon 
credits associated with the reduction of the emissions can be sold as 
certificates of emission reduction. 
5. There is currently a lack of data on the potential wind energy resources in 
the country. Usage of wind energy in the country is limited to pumping of 
water by windmills on cattle farms or for irrigation. Areas near the coast 
often experience a good steady flow of wind. The Markham Valley being the 
largest plain in the Morobe Province is a very ideal location and good area for development of wind farms as well as other valley systems in the 
country.
6. The specific details of Wind Energy as a Renewable Energy resource will be 
captured in the Renewable Energy Policy to be produced by the Institution
mandated to draw up this sectoral policy.
4.8.2 CHALLENGES
1. High upfront costs.
2. Most potential areas for wind energy generation are far away from the grid 
and load centres requiring high capital investment for transmission lines. 
3. Inadequate wind regime data. 
4. Limited after sales service. 
5. Inadequate wind energy industry standards due to fast changing technologies 
and enhanced capacities of turbines. 
6. Competing interest in land use with other commercial activities. 
7. Lack of RD&D in wind technologies. 
4.8.3 STRATEGIES– WIND ENERGY
1. The Government shall draft a new legislation specifically to regulate Wind 
Energy.
2. The Government shall formulate the Wind Energy Policy as a matter of 
urgency and align it with this Energy Policy.
3. The Government to setup a National Energy Authority of Papua New 
Guinea.
4. Enhance the institutional capacity to promote wide spread use of wind 
energy while enforcing the existing regulations and standards.
5. Designate an entity to promote, undertake data acquisition, accelerate 
exploitation of wind energy and provide a one stop shop for information and 
guidance to investors in wind energy projects. 6. Provide incentives to promote the local production and use of efficient wind 
systems.
7. Promote the use of hybrid power generation systems involving wind and 
other energy sources.
8. Provide a framework for connection of electricity generated from wind 
energy to national and isolated grids, through direct sale or net metering. 
9. Formulate and enforce minimum standards for wind energy technologies.
10.Plan transmission lines to facilitate evacuation of power from areas with 
high wind potential to major load centres. 
11.Undertake Research Development and Dissemination (RD&D) through 
institutions of higher learning. 
12.Enhance capacity building on wind technologies to provide support 
services. 
13.Provide fiscal incentives on wind energy equipment. 
14.Collect and compile wind energy data and update the wind atlas. 
15.Facilitate development of wind power generation of at least 100MW by 
2030.
4.9 MUNICIPAL WASTE
4.9.1 BACKGROUND
1. Municipal waste consists of solid waste including durable and nondurable 
goods, containers, food scraps, yard waste and inorganic waste from 
homes, institutions and businesses, wastes generated by manufacturing, 
agriculture, mining and construction and demolition debris, as well as sludge 
and liquid waste from water and wastewater treatment facilities, septic 
tanks, sewerage systems, slaughter houses. 
2. In order of preference, municipal waste can be managed by reduction of its 
production at source; reuse and/or recycling; treatment to destroy or reprocess waste to recover energy or other beneficial resources if the 
treatment does not threaten public health, safety, or the environment; or 
dumping and disposal. 
3. Most of the municipal waste in PNG is disposed in poorly managed dump 
sites. With appropriate waste-to energy technologies, municipal can be used 
to provide energy while helping to clean the environment. 
4. The current upgrading of the Baruni Waste Dump in the National Capital 
District as aided by the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) 
by using the Fukuoka Method can be utilised to produce Biogas for 
commercial use.
5. The specific details of Municipal Waste as a Renewable Energy resource 
will be captured in the Renewable Energy Policy to be produced by the 
Institution mandated to draw up this sectoral policy.
4.9.2 CHALLENGES
1. Lack of legal, regulatory and institutional framework for exploitation. 
2. Inadequate data and information on potential of municipal waste. 
3. Lack of incentives for exploitation. 
4.9.3 STRATEGIES– MUNICIPAL WASTE
1. In collaboration with the relevant line departments, develop legal, regulatory 
and institutional framework to address management and utilisation of 
municipal waste. 
2. In collaboration with Provincial Governments, acquire adequate data and 
information on potential of municipal waste. 
3. Provide incentives for conversion of municipal waste to energy.
4. Rollout Fukuoka Method to other Waste Dump sites in the country’s major 
cities and towns. 
4.10 BIOMASS CO-GENERATION4.10.1 BACKGROUND
1. Co-generation refers to the simultaneous production of heat and power from 
one single fuel source. It is common where plant processes require both 
heat and power such as sugar processing and offers opportunity for 
improved plant energy efficiency besides reducing energy costs and 
providing additional revenue stream through surplus power export to the 
national grid.
4.10.2 CHALLENGES
1. Use of obsolete, inefficient plant and equipment in the cogeneration industry. 
2. Lack of a reliable and continuous supply of bagasse. 
3. Limited technical, human and financial resources for cogeneration 
development. 
4. Inadequate technical capacity in commercial and emerging cogeneration 
technologies. 
5. Lack of awareness in cogeneration potential in areas where the agro-wastes 
are available. 
6. Inadequate data and documented assessment of resources and potential. 
7. Lack of model Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for cogenerated power in 
PNG. 
8. Insufficient information to investors on issues relating to licensing, taxation 
and feed in tariff policy
4.10.3 STRATEGIES– BIOMASS COGENERATION
1. Accelerate investment in efficient and emerging technologies.
2. Promote community programmes and projects in production and supply of 
raw materials such as bagasse. 
3. Undertake capacity building programmes in cogeneration technologies. 4. Carry out awareness programmes in cogeneration potential areas. 
5. Carry out a comprehensive study on cogeneration potential.

municipal and industrial waste as sources of energy.
14.Prepare integrated solid waste management plans and roadmaps.
15.Government to enter into PPP arrangements with the private sector entities 
to accelerate co-generation.
16.Develop criteria for certification schemes for cogeneration projects.
17.Undertake Pilot programmes to generate electricity using municipal and or 
industrial solid waste.
4.11 FEED IN TARIFFS
4.11.1 BACKGROUND
1. A Feed in Tariff (FiT) is an instrument of promoting electricity generation from 
renewable energy sources. It enables power producers to generate and sell 
Renewable Energy Sources Generated Electricity (RES-E) to a distributor at a 
pre-determined fixed tariff for a given period of time. 
2. The objectives of the FiT Policy are to: a. Facilitate resource mobilization by providing investment security and 
market stability for investors in electricity generation from Renewable 
Energy Sources. 
b. Reduce transaction and administrative costs and delays by eliminating 
the conventional bidding process and lengthy negotiations of PPA. 
c. Encourage private sector investors to operate their plants prudently 
and efficiently so as to maximize returns. 
3. The specific details of FiT for Renewable Energy resources will be captured 
in the Renewable Energy Policy to be produced by the Institution mandated 
to draw up this sectoral policy.
4.11.2 CHALLENGES
1. Insufficient data and analytical tools to inform the level of tariffs for different 
technologies.
2. Lack of awareness on FiT among the potential investors.
3. No clear guidelines on PPA negotiations which results in lengthy negotiations. 
4. Inadequate technical and financial capacity of some community based 
projects.
4.11.3 STRATEGIES– FEED IN TARRIF
1. Undertake a study on the capital expenditures and the operating costs on 
the different types of technologies and develop sufficient analytical tools to 
inform the level of tariffs for different technologies.
2. Initiate promotion campaigns to reach potential investors.
3. Develop model Power Purchase Agreements for the various modes of 
generation under FiT. 
4. Provide capacity building and financial assistance to community based 
projects.
5. Expand the scope of FiT to include the emerging technologies. 
6. NERC to provide guidelines and timelines for PPA negotiations.7. Develop an investment guide.
8. Set minimum and maximum tariffs to guide the negotiations for PPA under 
the FiT.
9. Review the FiT Policy to include operations and maintenance escalation 
components.
4.12 OTHER RENEWABLES
4.12.1 BACKGROUND
1. Other renewable energy sources and technologies are not yet widely 
demonstrated or commercialised. These include ocean energy, biomass 
gasification, bio-refinery technologies and concentrating solar power. 
Particularly, a subject of interest is ocean energy, owing to the coastline of 
Papua New Guinea. 
2. The oceans contain huge amounts of power that can be drawn from different 
sources and exploited for generating useful energy. The most developed 
conversion systems use tidal energy, thermal energy, marine currents and 
ocean waves.
3. Fast-flowing ocean currents like Sohano Island Passage in Buka, North 
Bougainville can be harnessed as well as other coastal areas of extreme 
differences in high tides and low tides. 
4. Other renewable energy resources will be captured in the Renewable Energy 
Policy to be produced by the Institution mandated to draw up this sectoral 
policy.
4.12.2 CHALLENGES
1. Lack of legal, regulatory and institutional framework for utilization of emerging 
renewable energies. 2. Inadequate data and information on potential of renewable energies. 
3. Lack of incentives for utilization. 
4.12.3 STRATEGIES– OTHER RENEWABLES
1. The Government shall draft a new legislation specifically to regulate 
Renewable Energy.
2. The Government shall formulate the Renewable Energy Policy as a matter of 
urgency and align it with this Energy Policy.
3. The Government to setup a National Energy Authority of Papua New Guinea.
4. Develop legal, regulatory and institutional framework for utilization.
 
5. Acquire data and information on potential of other renewable energies. 
6. Provide incentives for exploitation.
4.13 CROSS CUTTING ISSUES
4.13.1 CHALLENGES
1. Inadequate institutional, legal and regulatory framework for management of 
renewable energy resources including: 
2. Criteria for allocation to investors of energy resource areas such as 
geothermal fields. 
3. Licensing of Renewable energy areas. 
4. Management of multi-purpose projects such as dams and reservoirs for power 
generation, portable water, flood control and irrigation. 
5. Management of energy resource areas such as, catchment areas, forests, 
municipal waste as well as areas with good wind regimes, tidal and wave 
energy. 
6. Corporate Social Responsibility requirements. 7. Environmental protection, conservation and management. 
8. Mechanism for working out national government, Provincial government and 
local community benefits sharing. 
9. Payment of royalty on proceeds from renewable energy resources. 
10.Other than geothermal energy and large hydros, there is no lead agency to 
spearhead development of other renewable energy resources. 
11.Absence of local credit schemes and financing mechanisms. 
12.Inadequate public awareness on the economic opportunities offered by 
renewable energy and renewable energy technologies. 
4.13.2 STRATEGIES– CROSS CUTTING RENEWABLE ENERGY
1. The Government shall establish an inter-departmental Renewable Energy 
Resources Advisory Committee (RERAC) composed of members 
representing; Departments in-charge of Petroleum and Energy, Mineral Policy 
And Geo-Hazards Management, Finance, Treasury, Environment and 
Conservation, and the relevant Provincial Governments to advise the Chief 
Secretary on criteria for allocation of renewable energy resource areas and 
specifically in relation to: 
a. Licensing of renewable energy resource areas.
b. Management of multi-purpose projects such as dams and reservoirs for 
power generation, portable water, flood control and irrigation.
c. Management of energy resource areas such as, catchment areas, 
forests, municipal waste as well as areas with good wind regimes, tidal 
and wave energy.
2. The Government shall:
a. Transform PNG Power Limited (PPL) into a profitable business by 
unbundling it into independent bodies for generation of power, 
transmission, distribution and retail. b. Develop a tariff for net metering for electricity generated from 
renewable energy sources by electricity consumers. 
c. Revitalize the existing Department responsible for Petroleum and 
Energy matters in PNG and establish others with a view to promote 
renewable energy use. 
3. Partner with financiers to enable the public to access credits schemes. 
4. Develop capacity building programmes for players in renewable energy 
technologies in collaboration with training institutions and the energy 
centres 
5. Introduce net and smart metering policy to encourage consumers sell 
excess power generated from the renewable energy systems. 
6. Prepare a master plan for renewable energy. 
7. Promote community based power generation. 
8. Create awareness on the benefits resulting from development of clean 
energy technologies.
9. Establish a Renewable Energy Research Centre (RERC) under the 
auspices of the new National Energy Authority (NEA) and supported by 
other Research Institutions in the country and abroad for the handling of 
renewable energy promotion, potential analysis, mapping and other related 
studies. 
10.Establish green energy certification schemes. 
11.Establish energy efficiency/conservation projects certification schemes. 
12.The government will provide necessary support for the implementation of 
the renewable energy projects in the populated areas including facilitation 
of acquisition, relocation and resettlement of project affected person.5 TRANSPORTATION FUELS SECTOR
5.1 BACKGROUND
1. It is of significant national interest that the transportation fuels sector is 
regulated in a manner that is efficient and environmentally sound while at the 
same time security of supply is adequate managed through appropriate 
mechanisms, The Government understands the inherent need to better 
regulate this sector as the national economy cannot progress without the 
fuels sector performing efficiently.
2. What is principally important to the Government is that the provision of fuels 
in the country is affordable, accessible, and reliable. Most importantly, fuels 
sold in PNG must meet quality and environmental standards and the 
Government would make sure appropriate standards and regulations are put 
in place to better regulate the sector. 
3. This policy supports the PNG National Transport Strategy (NTS) for the use 
of sustainable energy through encouraging the following measures;
a. The introduction of fuel-efficient transport and engines that are able to 
operate on bio-fuels from sustainable sources.
b. Domestic biodiesel and bio-ethanol for the transport sector.
c. The operation and maintenance of equipment in a manner that 
minimizes consumption and emission of carbon dioxide emissions; 
and
d. The use of vehicle fleet-weighted against the fuel and emissions 
efficiency, ascertained from annual report.
5.1.1 ROAD TRANSPORTATION FUELS
1. Road transportation is a very important mode of transportation and a very 
reliable medium for the delivery of goods and services in PNG. The 
Government would like to see this sector grow and significant capital 
investments have been already made in road building and more funds will be 
injected into this vital sector of the economy.
2. Diesel and petrol are the two main fuel types used widely in the country, 
apart from lubricants. Prices for these fuels are amongst the highest in the 
region and the world. The Government would address high fuel cost
concerns by encouraging competition in the market, including encouraging 
investments in new oil refineries.3. The cost of fuel and basic goods and services in areas located far from the 
main cities and towns are even far higher because of the associated cost 
involved with long distances. The Government will open up many new roads 
and focus on building a modern road network that provides the catalyst for 
economic growth. 
4. The Government will strongly push for the development and use of 
alternative clean fuels to replace high pollutant fuels like diesel and petrol. 
Natural gas in the form of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) is one fuel that 
will be seriously assessed for use in the future as the environmental, cost 
and efficiency benefits are considered to be high. Other fuels like solar and 
hydrogen will be also considered for research and trials as well for use in the 
road transportation sector.
5. Specific regulations will be formulated to also control noise and air pollution 
from the production and use of fuels. These regulations will also cover the 
production and use of lubricants as well. 
5.1.2 SEA TRANSPORT FUELS
1. Marine transportation is also very crucial for coastal villages and towns as 
well as for all other economic and commercial activities. The current high 
cost of fuel is a concern to the Government because businesses often 
transfer the high costs they incurred down to the end users. For instance, 
the fisherman would always factor the cost of fuel to be reflected in the price 
of fish that he sells to the consumers. 
2. Diesel, petrol and lubricants are the main fuel types used in this sector.
3. Again, the Government believes that the fuels market in PNG must be open 
to competition so the fuel consumers benefit from comparatively cheaper fuel 
prices.
5.1.3 AIR TRANSPORTATION FUELS
1. The aviation sector plays a pivotal role in the PNG economy. It is a sector 
that is so important to the country because of the rugged and mountainous 
conditions of the country. 
2. Cost of air transportation is extremely high in PNG and perhaps this is one of 
the reasons why the cost structure of business in PNG is very high. In simple, it means that the high cost of fuel is captured in the prices of all other 
goods and services in the country. 
3. The Government is aware that high aviation cost is a disincentive to 
investment in PNG, including tourism. It will therefore take appropriate 
actions to address the high cost issues.
4. One key area of interest to the Government is to assess how Jet-A1 fuel can 
be produced domestically using domestically produced crude oil. 
Additionally, the PNG Government is aware that the international aviation 
industry is undertaking research and development in harnessing solar energy 
as an alternative fuel to the fossil-oriented Jet-A1 fuel. Therefore the 
Government will closely observe the development of this new technology and 
when the timing is appropriate, will consider how best to use this technology. 
5.1.4 SUPPLY SOURCES
1. The Government recognizes the importance of the fuels market and how 
important it is to growing the PNG economy and to improve the living 
standards of the people. Therefore efficient management of the sector is an 
important priority of the Government.
2. In order to reduce the cost of fuels and transfer cost benefits to business and 
individuals, the Government would seek to secure feedstock crude oil from 
domestic oil and gas projects and refined in a refinery owned by a State 
owned entity (SOE). The feedstock crude will come from a portion of the 
State’s equity share in various oil and gas fields in the country or from any of 
the oil and gas projects at a purchase price equivalent to the cost of 
production. This policy is also applicable to the off-take and utilization of 
natural gas for domestic purposes including the use of gas for transportation
fuels such as CNG.
3. The objective of this policy is to reduce the current high business cost 
structure in PNG which is a major disincentive to business and investment in 
the country. Hence, the Government aims to ensure the price of refined fuels 
in PNG is reduced by 40 – 50 percent of the current market price which is 
based on the Import Parity Price (IPP).5.1.5 COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS (CNG)
1. The Government would seriously look into the commercial and technical 
viabilities of utilizing CNG as the predominant transportation fuel in PNG. 
Once studies confirm that CNG is feasible to be used, the Government would 
make to mandatory for all vehicles in PNG to use CNG.
2. All CNG requirements would be produced domestically and the feed gas 
would be sourced from a portion of the State equity interest in any oil and gas 
project in PNG or would be secured under the 15 per cent Gas Reservation 
Policy and at a price equivalent to the cost of production. 
3. The Government would invest in Research and Development in order to 
determine the feasibility of utilizing CNG in the marine transportation sector as 
well.
5.1.6 COMPETITION
1. The Government would encourage competition in the fuels market in the 
entire business value chain. This means any investor can invest in a new 
refinery or import refined fuels as long as they conform to quality standards 
and specifications. The PNG economy and the people would be the biggest 
beneficiaries under such a competitive market environment.
2. In order to promote efficiency and price transparency, the Government shall 
encourage the separation of ownership in all segments of the market from 
wholesaling to distribution and retailing. 
5.1.7 OWNERSHIP
1. All new players as from the commencement of this policy in the fuels market 
in PNG will be wholly nationally-owned companies from wholesales to 
retailing segments of the market.
5.1.8 REGULATION
1. The PNG ICCC will be the principal regulator of the fuels market.5.1.9 GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY
1. Many governments around the world offer price subsidies to the fuels sector 
in order to relief businesses and citizens from high fuel prices. The PNG 
Government considers that the most appropriate way to support the 
economy and the citizens is to establish the appropriate policies as well as 
regulatory and legislative frameworks for a strong and robust market 
economy where competition is promoted so the correct price is set by the 
market forces.6 ELECTRICITY
6.1 BACKGROUND
1. Electricity is a secondary source of energy generated through the 
consumption of primary energy sources namely fossil fuels, renewable 
energy and nuclear energy. By virtue of its versatility in application, it is 
crucial to economic growth and is the most sought after energy service by 
society. Access to electricity is associated with rising or high quality of life. 
2. The electricity supply industry (ESI) value chain consists of four elements, 
as shown below. 
a. First, there is generation, requiring both a fuel source (e.g., hydro, 
geothermal, petroleum or wind energy) and a power plant to convert 
the fuel source into electrical energy. 
b. Second, the generated electricity is transformed (stepped up) for 
transmission over high voltage power lines; and matching end user 
requirements (demand) with energy availability (supply), referred to 
as system operations. 
c. The third element is distribution where electricity is transformed again 
(stepped down) to enable delivery or supply of electrical energy to 
end users or consumers via a vast network of power lines and 
substations. 
d. Finally, there is delivery or supply which entails retailing of electrical 
energy to consumers through a series of commercial functions –
procuring, pricing, selling, metering, billing and revenue collection. 
e. Generation, transmission, system operations and distribution are 
physical functions, while wholesaling and delivery/retailing are 
merchant or commercial functions. 
3. Competition in the industry generally means competition in the generation of 
electricity, as well as in the commercial functions. The transportation (transmission and distribution) as well as system operation functions are 
natural monopolies as it does not make economic, environmental or 
aesthetic sense to build multiple sets of competing systems in any one area. 
System operations is also non-competitive, since the system operator has 
to control all the plants in a control area, otherwise the system would not 
function efficiently or safely. 
4. The electricity supply industry (ESI) in Papua New Guinea has been 
undergoing reforms and restructuring since the mid-90s with the aims of, 
inter alia: 
a. Creating appropriate legal, regulatory and institutional framework for 
the ESI. 
b. Ensuring provision of affordable reliable, efficient, accessible and 
sustainable electric power supplies. 
c. Increasing the population’s access to electricity as a means of 
stimulating economic growth. To date only 13 percent of the 
households are connected to electricity after 50 years of existence by 
the States ESI.
d. Improving the efficiency of power distribution and supply through 
reductions in technical losses and collection of revenues. 
5. Creating a more competitive market structure with clear definition of roles for 
public and private sector players in generation, transmission, distribution and 
retail functions.
6.2 DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY
1. Demand for electricity has shown an upward trend since the year 2011 due 
to accelerated economic growth. Figure 3, overleaf shows ICCC’s 
forecasted demand for electricity (regulated and total demand).Figure 4 - Estimated domestic energy demand
Source: ICCC Report on the PNG Power Ltd Regulatory Contract Review
2. PNG does not operate on an interconnected national power grid instead with 
only islanded electricity networks located around the more populated areas 
and industrial sites. Out of the total 580 MW installed generation capacity in 
PNG, PPL capacity is estimated at 300MW, while the 280MW is generated by 
other entities that consume power mainly for their own use (e.g. mining
enclaves). 
3. Due to the population distribution where the majority of the population live in 
rural areas (and difficult terrain) the electrification rate is only 13% in PNG; 
with less than 1% access to electricity by most people in the outer provinces, 
except NCD with some 16.4% access to electricity in terms of the total 
population.
4. Major drivers of the demand include increased economic activities in 
various zones, particularly within the Lae (Ramu), Port Moresby and 
Gazelle systems. Additional latent demand coming mainly from the 
extractive industries remains unmet due to the very large electricity 
requirements. Table 3 overleaf shows PPLs generation demand per zones 
as of end of 2014.

5. It is anticipated that electricity demand will rise sharply as energy intensive 
activities such as mining, infrastructure developments, new LNG facilities, 
commercial and residential building constructions and numerous other 
activities are ramped up in the short to medium term. Table 4 overleaf 
shows some of the recent and proposed project in the mining sector with 
estimated electricity demand.

6.3.1 BACKGROUND
1. Electricity generation in PNG is liberalised with several licensed electric 
power producers whose combined installed capacity was 580MW as of 
December 20135. This includes privately owned generation by major mining 
activates. A combination of several renewal and non-renewal sources used 
for this generation as shown in Figure 4 below.
Figure 5 – PNGs Total Installed Capacity

2. The Ramu (especially Lae City) and the Port Moresby Systems rely on 
hydro power generated from Yonki in Eastern Highlands Province and 
Rouna in Central Province. These hydro powered centres are also backed 
up by diesel power stations (both reciprocating diesel generators and open 
cycle gas fired turbine generators being run on heated diesel). Western 
Power also relies on small diesel power stations to supply electricity to its 
customers in Western Province.

Geothermal3. IPP’s like PNG Forest Products Limited and Hanjung Power Limited 
generate power in Bulolo and Kanudi respectively and sell the power 
generated to PPL. 
4. Whilst total installed capacity stands at some 580MW, total electricity 
demand is projected to increase to a substantial 800MW by year 2020.
5. In order to provide affordable electricity for these activities which are 
expected to transform our economy, a roadmap to raise the generation 
capacity has to be undertaken. 
6. The road map will require the construction of various transmission lines to 
evacuate power to respective load centres. This will require significant 
investment by the Government of Papua New Guinea (GoPNG).
6.3.2 GENERATION OF ELECTRICITY USING FUELS
6.3.2.1 BACKGROUND
1. Thermal power plants generate electrical energy using fossil fuels, mainly, 
oil, natural gas and coal.
2. All thermal generating plants in PNG are run on imported petroleum fuels 
which are subject to volatile international oil market prices which are passed 
through to consumers. Consumption of oil will be progressively reduced
and be replaced by natural gas. 
6.3.2.2 ADVANTAGES
1. Thermal power generation: 
(a) Requires a relatively shorter period of between 12 to 18 months for 
construction.
(b) Requires smaller physical space compared to hydro and geothermal 
power plants. 
(c) Lower capital cost compared to hydro power and geothermal power 
plants. 
(d) Can be installed in any part of the country as compared to hydro 
power and geothermal plants which are site specific. 
(e) Attractive to private investment due to faster return on investment. 
6.3.2.3 CHALLENGES1. Inadequate infrastructure for power supply to communities in the 
neighbourhood of generation plants. 
2. High recurrent cost due to use of petroleum fuels leading to higher 
electricity costs. 
3. Petroleum fuel is not renewable.
4. Causes environmental pollution which requires costly mitigation 
measures. 
5. Thermal power plants have a relatively shorter life span of about 20 to 
25 years compared to hydropower plants which have a lifespan of 
over 50 years. 
6. Thermal power has relatively lower conversion efficiency of less than 
50% compared to hydropower plants which have over 90% efficiency. 
6.3.2.4 STRATEGIES– ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION 
1. The Government shall do necessary amendments to the Electricity Industry 
Act 2002 (EIA 2002) and other legislations and vest the regulating of the 
industry with the industry regulator to be known as the Electricity Regulatory 
Commission.
2. The Government shall review the Electricity Industry Policy as a matter of 
urgency and align it with this Energy Policy.
3. Put in place mechanisms to ensure that the local communities benefit 
from developments of the electricity supply infrastructure. 
4. The Government will encourage electricity generation using indigenous 
fossil fuels primarily natural gas and coal including facilitating PPPs. 
5. The Government will ensure that all equipment procured for thermal 
power plants shall be designed and constructed to minimise the 
environmental impact while giving consideration to visual impact, wildlife 
and temporary disturbance during construction, maintenance and 
operation. 6. The Government shall promote the utilisation of Combined Cycle Gas 
Turbine (CCGT) plants to increase efficiency. 
7. Regulator to develop appropriate standards and mechanisms for 
consumer protection including but not limited to reliable, and stable, 
power supply includes repair and maintenance time lines. The regime 
should include penalties.
8. Establish natural gas handling and storage facilities in the country.
9. Enforce compliance for pollution prevention and reduction in thermal 
power plants. 
10.Promote generation from renewable energy resources based on least 
cost and efficiency criteria. 
6.4 GENERATION OF ELECTRICITY USING NUCLEAR ENERGY
6.4.1 BACKGROUND
1. The uptake of nuclear power technology has been growing over time across 
different countries and regions. Various countries without existing nuclear 
power technology in their power systems have expressed interest in 
investing in nuclear electricity production, while developed countries with 
existing nuclear plants have been expanding their capacities. All over the 
world, as of September 2013, there were 435 nuclear power plants in 
operation, 28 under construction and 222 in the planning stage.
2. Although PNG does not have a clear position on Nuclear energy 
development and deployment it is recognised as a form of energy used in 
other developed and developing countries, which PNG could develop in 
time.
6.5 ELECTRIC POWER TRANSMISSION
6.5.1 BACKGROUND
1. The existing transmission network is currently confined to the three (3) 
major systems in Port Moresby, Lae (Ramu) and Gazelle respectively as 
shown in the figure 5 overleaf. This system is anticipated to be extended 
dramatically in order to improve network coverage, in-line with the proposed 
National Electricity Rollout Plan (NEROP).Figure 6 – PPLs existing transmission network
Source: PNG Power Ltd, as at October 2014.
2. This existing transmission system capacity is severely constrained 
particularly during peak hours. The problem is partly due to inadequate 
reactive power in major load centres and also transmission constraints 
particularly in Port Moresby, Ramu and Gazelle systems.
6.5.2 EXTENSION OF THE NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK
1. As part of its mandate, PPL is currently undertaking new transmission 
projects aimed at developing a robust grid system to:-
a. Enable evacuation of the additional transmission lines across existing 
system, including economic corridor system inter-connections.
b. Improve quality and reliability of electricity supply throughout the 
country by ensuring adequate evacuation capacity. c. Reduce the cost of electricity to the consumer by absorbing the capital 
cost of transmission lines since they will be fully funded by the National 
Government. 
d. Provide interconnection links with the neighbouring countries in order 
to facilitate power exchange and develop electricity trade in the region. 
e. Reduce transmission losses through upgrading of transmission line 
from current 60kV to 132kVs for distance greater than 100 kilometres; 
and up to 400kV for distances greater than 500kilometers.
f. Open up off-grid areas in order to ease connectivity to electricity by 
constructing transmission lines to link them up to the national grid.
g. As earlier stated, the numerous economic activities springing up in 
major areas of the country requires a corresponding increase in 
generation capacity and transmission network. Consequently, the 
number of transmission lines projected for construction in the next 5 
years needs to be substantial to meet this need. 
6.5.3 REGIONAL INTERCONNECTION
1. There is a potential for Papua New Guinean transmission network to be 
interconnected with Australia and Indonesia’s system through a 132 kV 
double circuit transmission line. The arrangement would allow for electrical 
energy exchange between PNG and a number of Australian cities of the 
State of Queensland such as Gladstone; thus likewise corroborate to 
connect electricity systems to neighbouring cities in Indonesia. 
2. At this stage, focus of the export of the energy would be between regional 
areas such as from Papua into the Highlands and onto the Momase 
Regions respectively via network connections of the main grids.
6.5.4 PNG ECONOMIC CORRIDORS
1. Energy development planning will be based on the ten economic corridors as 
per the PNG SDP 2010-2030.
2. The Ten (10) Economic Corridors are proposed to alleviate poverty, as they 
will be located in the poorest regions of PNG with the aim of extending the 
benefits of development to the most disadvantaged regions. This is the region 
where the government has plans to develop well planned zoning system, 
comprehensive and effective network of transport and utilities, and quality
education and health services. Within this region, businesses are able to operate at low cost and under well 
designed incentives, thereby encouraging foreign and domestic private sector 
investments. By concentrating the construction of essential infrastructure 
within certain regions the economic corridor approach takes advantage of the 
substantial economies of scale and scope associated with large service sector 
infrastructure. 
Figure 7. PNG’s Economic Corridors
Source: PNG SDP 2010 - 2030
3. The Ten (10) Economic Corridors are:
 Petroleum Resource Area Economic Corridor (PRAEC): Southern 
Highlands, parts of Enga, Gulf, and Central provinces. The PRAEC was 
approved by Cabinet in May 2009.
 Border Corridor (Western, Southern Highlands and Sandaun Provinces)
 Central Corridor (Central, Milne Bay, Oro and Morobe)
 Madang-Baiyer-Karamui-Gulf Corridor (Madang, Simbu, Gulf and Western 
Highlands)
 Morobe-Madang Corridor
 Enga-Sepiks Corridor (Enga and East & West Sepik Provinces)
 South Coast Corridor (East New Britain and West New Britain)
 Momase Corridor ( Madang, East Sepik, and West Sepik provinces) Solomons Corridor (Autonomous Region of Bougainville)
 Free Zone Corridor (Manus, New Ireland, East and West Sepik)
Figure 8. Proposed 10 economic corridors
Source: PNG Medium Term Development Plan
4. The potential demand to be created from the economic corridor concept lies in 
such economic developments:
(a) Livestock, crops and an agricultural processing plant;
(b) Downstream processing facilities and agricultural farms;
(c) Tourism, service centre and downstream processing;
(d) Heavy industries and international trading zones; and
(e) Light industries and international service and trading zones. 
6.5.5 BENEFITS OF INTERCONNECTIVITY
1. Security of supply and system stability due to increased generation mix. 2. Increasing national economic efficiency by operating on lower reserve 
margins. 
3. Expanded power market sizes and reduced country specific risks. 
4. Capital saving as the country need not invest in new stations. 
5. Increases competition by providing options for cheaper power. 
6. Electricity access to remote areas. 
7. Shared reserve margin. 
8. The transmission infrastructure acts as a catalyst for investment in nonconventional renewable energy sources. 
6.5.6 CHALLENGES
1. Weak, inadequate and poorly -integrated transmission infrastructure capacity.
2. Displacement, environmental, health and safety issues. 
3. Vandalism on transmission network.
4. Inadequate local technical skills especially in HVDC systems. 
5. Land and way leaves acquisition.
6. Encroachment of the way leaves trace. 
7. Insufficient framework for private participation in development of transmission 
infrastructure. 
8. Inadequate policy, legal and institutional framework for the operationalization 
of the independent system operator. 
6.5.7 STRATEGIES– ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION1. The Government shall do necessary amendments to the Electricity Industry 
Act and other legislations and vests the regulating of the industry with the 
industry regulator to be known as the Electricity Regulatory Commission.
2. The Government shall review the Electricity Industry Policy as a matter of 
urgency and align it with this Energy Policy.
3. The Government to provide for a specific SPV and or the SOE involved in this 
sector of the Electricity Supply Industry.
4. The Government shall support open access of the transmission network 
taking into account existing contractual commitments and provide a 
mechanism for determination of wheeling charges applicable to transmission 
lines.
5. The Government will establish the legal and regulatory mechanisms for 
competitive electricity market and further support regional integration of the 
power system to enhance regional power trade.
6. The Government will continue to fund the development of the national 
transmission system to enhance affordability. The Government will continue to 
assist transmission licences access credit to enhance capacity, improve 
reliability and reduce losses in the networks.
7. The Government will designate and provide, legal and institutional framework 
for an independent system operator (ISO).
8. Ensure adequate and timely national transmission infrastructure is put in place 
including evacuation of electrical energy from early generation geothermal 
plants.
9. The Government to ensure transmission reliability by establishing 
redundancies in transmission system.
10.Increase national and regional transmission network for full regional 
interconnection.
6.6 ELECTRIC POWER DISTRIBUTION
6.6.1 BACKGROUND1. The distribution network entails receipt of bulk supply of electrical energy 
from generation or transmission network and transfer of this energy through 
distribution lines and distribution substations to consumers. 
2. Reliability and quality of supply remains a key area of concern. As such, 
more focus and emphasis are concentrated to continue giving due 
consideration to resolving repetitive breakdown cases to reduce the number 
of incidences and improve repair time. The sharp increase in vandalism 
considerably contributed to this worsening situation leading to a number of 
transformer failures and consequential power outages. 
3. The technical and commercial losses arising during the transmission and 
distribution of electricity are as provided in Table 6 below.

Source: [PPL, 2010] NB. Current figures from 2011 onwards not publicly available.
6.6.2 DISTRIBUTION EXPANSION PLAN
1. The objective of the ongoing Energy Access Scale-Up (EAS-U) programme 
is to increase connectivity countrywide. It involves expansion of the national 
power distribution grid to connect new customers both in urban and rural 
areas.
2. In addition, more projects will be initiated to reduce system losses, enhance 
reliability and quality of supply by enhancing the sub-transmission. By the 
year 2020, capacities of primary and distribution substations, High Voltage
lines and Medium Voltage lines are estimated to increase substantially. 6.6.3 CHALLENGES IN DISTRIBUTION
1. High end-user electricity tariffs including standing charges. 
2. High electricity connection charges. 
3. Vandalism of electric power infrastructure. 
4. Lengthy process of way-leaves acquisition. 
5. Encroachment of way-leaves trace. 
6. Weak distribution network characterized by limited redundancy and aging 
installations leading to frequent and prolonged supply interruptions. 
7. Most of the distribution networks in major cities, urban areas and the coastal 
strip are overhead and therefore prone to frequent interruptions due to 
corrosion and climatic changes. 
8. High system losses. 
9. Illegal power line connections and theft of electricity. 
10.Physical plans in most cases do not provide an infrastructure corridor for 
electricity reticulation. 
11.High arbitrary levies charged by the public institutions on power 
infrastructures. 
12.Lack of a legal framework for operationalization of open access. 
6.6.4 STRATEGIES– DISTRIBUTION
1. The National Government shall ensure gradual elimination of overhead 
distribution systems to provide efficient and safe distribution services by duly 
licensed network service providers, so as to reduce power supply 
interruptions and improve the quality of supply and service. 
2. The Provincial Government may plan and develop distribution networks and
transfer them to distributor(s) duly licensed to operate and maintain them in 
line with the national policy of having only one distributor in a given area at any particular time for efficiency and technical effectiveness of the national
power network. 
3. The National Government shall provide a legal framework to support open 
access of the distribution network taking into account existing contractual 
commitments and provide mechanism for determination of wheeling charges 
applicable to distribution lines.
4. The Government will continue funding the development of distribution 
network in rural areas and continue to support strengthening of distribution 
network in the rest of the areas through licensed distributors.
6.7 RURAL ELECTRIFICATION
6.7.1 BACKGROUND
1. Energy shortages and supply disruptions coupled with high cost remains 
serious obstacles to economic activity in PNG. At present 90% of the PNG’s 
population still lack access to electricity services and the progress of rural 
electrification has lagged over the years. 
2. The Provincial Governments have embarked on various rural electrification 
programs with PPL, unguided by any appropriate policy mechanisms. Making 
electricity accessible to the masses at the rural levels would require a holistic 
government approach.
6.7.2 CHALLENGES
1. High costs of connection. 
2. Scattered population settlements in the rural areas leading to long distribution 
lines. The non-controlled sub-division of arable land has escalated this 
problem. 
3. Harsh terrains and inaccessibility due to under developed infrastructure leads 
to high cost of rural electrification projects. 
4. High operating costs of grids in rural areas due to low population density. 
5. Acquisition of way leaves due to high compensation demand by public 
institutions and land owners. 6. Vandalism of power infrastructure
6.7.3 STRATEGIES– RURAL ELECTRIFICATION
1. Develop a rural electrification master plan. 
2. Create a rural electricity funding mechanism.
3. Promote off-grid renewable energy technologies.
 
4. Give impetus to the National Electrification Program Fund (NEPF) to 
empower the economically unviable areas. 
5. Seek funding from development partners for specific programmes 
especially in areas less attractive to the private sector and complement 
self-help groups and private sector efforts in rural electrification projects.
6. Build appropriate local capacity for manufacture, installation, maintenance 
and operation of appropriate energy technologies in rural areas. 
7. Provide incentives to both users and producers of energy technologies in 
rural areas. 
8. Package and disseminate information on energy systems in rural areas to 
create investor and consumer awareness on economic potential offered by 
these systems. 
9. Support the activities of organizations and bodies that deal with rural 
electrification initiatives. 
10.Implement cooperation arrangements with Provincial Governments and 
Local Level Governments for accelerated implementation of rural 
electrification programme. 
6.7.4 CROSS CUTTING ISSUES
1. Outdated or lack of land use master plans which have made it difficult and 
expensive to acquire land and way-leaves for power infrastructure 
development. 2. The policy and decision making processes in public energy sector players are 
complicated by their corporate governance structures which are influenced by 
government policy, board appointments, existing laws and regulations. 
3. High cost of financing energy infrastructure projects. 
4. Insufficient fiscal and other incentives for private sector investment. 
5. Lack of adequate port facilities for handling cheaper energy resources 
including coal and natural gas to support power generation. 
6. The restructuring of the sector creates challenges due to existing obligations 
including Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), financial covenants and asset 
ownership. 
7. Demand for power in some areas is low due to lack of economic activities as 
well as poor infrastructure rendering some of the electrification projects 
unsustainable.
6.7.5 STRATEGIES– ELECTRICITY CROSS CUTTING ISSUES
1. The Government shall: 
(a) provide funds for pre-feasibility and feasibility studies for energy 
Projects; 
(b) ensure that integrated plans for the electricity supply system are 
prepared; 
(c) where necessary acquire land and way-leaves for energy infrastructure 
development; 
(d) develop a resettlement action plan framework policy for energy related 
projects. 
2. The Government will provide fiscal incentives to encourage investors to 
acquire and develop energy development technologies. 7 UNBUNDLING OF PNG POWER LIMITED
7.1 PNG POWER LIMITED - AT PRESENT
1. PNG Power Limited (PPL) is a fully integrated power authority responsible for 
generation, transmission, distribution and retailing of electricity throughout 
Papua New Guinea and servicing individual electricity consumers. PPL 
services customers in almost all urban centres throughout the country 
encompassing industrial, commercial, government and domestic sectors. 
Where possible, the services extend to rural communities adjacent to these 
urban centres.
2. PPL was established under the Electricity Commission (Privatisation) Act 
2000 to be the successor company taking over all assets, liabilities and 
personnel of the Papua New Guinea Electricity Commission (ELCOM). PPL is 
also governed by another Act of Parliament, the Electricity Industry 
(Amendment) Act 2002 which established a regulatory regime for the 
Electricity Industry.
3. PPL as a corporatized entity operates in accordance with the Companies Act 
1997. The Constitution of PPL has been established in compliance with 
this Act. The Constitution establishes the functions and responsibilities of the 
Board to the shareholders and the general administrative and reporting 
requirements.
4. PPL is also undertaking a regulatory role on behalf of the Independent 
Consumer and Competition Commission (ICCC). These responsibilities 
include approving licenses for electrical contractors, providing certification for 
models of electrical equipment and appliances to be sold in the country 
and providing safety advisory services and checks for major installations.
5. PPL (Company No 1-44680) was corporatized under Section 3 (1) of the 
Electricity Commission (Privatisation) Act 2002 as the successor company to 
the ELCOM. All of ELCOM's assets, liabilities, rights, titles and personnel 
were transferred to PPL.
6. PPL is a State Owned Entity (SOE). The Independent Public Business 
Corporation (IPBC) holds the shares for corporatized state entities as trustee 
of the General Business Trust (GBT). The IPBC acts as the sole shareholder 
on behalf of the Government. The Minister for State Enterprises appoints a 
Board who report to IPBC. PPL, through the Board provides regular financial and operational reports and 
a Five-year Business Plan to IPBC on an annual basis.
7.2 ISSUES, CHALLENGES AND POLICY IMPERATIVES
1. PPL as a state owned enterprise evolved from a government utilities 
company established as a natural monopoly in the absence of private 
companies with large power generation capabilities to its current 
corporatized state but still within government control. As a result PPL 
suffers legacy issues requiring attention and redress the same as many 
state power companies and power boards around the world. 
These include:
(a) Inability to keep pace with the expanding power demand by a 
rapidly growing economy and the developmental needs of PNG 
resulting in a huge shortfall in power supply relative to demand.
(b) The current PPL organizational structures and business processes 
do not clearly distinguish the major functions/businesses of 
generation, transmission, distribution and retail.
(c) Legacy issues amongst employees still retaining Public Service way 
of doing things.
(d) Lack of governance and accountability.
(e) Transmission and distribution losses of over 35%.
(f) Aging power generating equipment with regular breakdowns.
(g) Aging power transmission and distribution infrastructure with most 
of the substations and transformers affected by overloading.
(h) Lack of appropriate Power System Planning, Marketing and 
Development Program
(i) Financing and Refinancing: efficiencies and credit rating
(j) Insurance: none for IPPs.
2. Numerous studies and reports by learned commentators including the 
National Research Institute specifically as well as ADB generally have 
been critical of PPL’s operations and capacity to assist Government in 
delivering on the government's vision. The seminars and reports 
recommended "Unbundling" of a number of State Owned Enterprises 
(SOEs) including PPL as the way forward.2. The recent declaration of Emergency within the Electricity Services by the 
National Executive Council in its Decision No.357/2014, supports the notion 
that drastic measures has to be taken to turn the company around, and 
improve the reliability and availability of power supply throughout the 
country and communities which entirely depend on the company for their 
electricity needs.
3. PPL is not only engaging in the electricity business, more so, it is also the 
technical regulator of the industry, under delegation from the ICCC. This is 
creating a ‘chicken and egg’ situation for the company. Such a position 
unnecessary impedes the company’s ability to pursue its commercial 
objectives, whilst ensuring regulations are enforced and complied.
4. The ICCC has continued to play a key role in the development of various 
industries it is empowered to regulate. The electricity industry is one such 
industry. The mandate of the ICCC encompasses protecting the bona fide 
interest of consumers, promoting and protecting competition, and regulating 
State Owned Enterprises. 
5. As a case in point, the Government’s ICT Policy of 2008 had recognised the 
immense regulatory challenges posed to the transformation of the 
telecommunications industry and subsequently promulgated the emergence 
of a new industry specific regulator. Such lessons learnt are useful in 
informing any reforms initiated into other industries, such as being proposed 
here for the energy and electricity industry. 
6. Moreover, the fact that ICCC has delegated its technical functions to PPL, in 
the case of electricity industry, indicates the resource and technical capacity 
constraints inherent in the economic regulator to perform its mandated roles 
and functions under the Electricity Industry Act 2002 (EIA 2002).
7. Notwithstanding the issues and challenges raise above, there are policy 
imperatives set by the state in relation to energy that need to be achieved. 
These include:
(a) Vision 2050, section 1.17.9.9 states "Provide 100 percent power 
generation from renewable energy sources"; this is achieved through 
large renewable energy projects to be developed.
(b) The White Paper on State’s Ownership and Participation in 
Commercial Activities (the White Paper) clearly articulates the policy 
options that should be pursued in resource development. In hydro dam and geothermal electricity projects the White Paper advocates 
for landowner equity participations. The land upon which the project 
sits is their equity contributions per se. As a matter of policy, it is 
proposed here that landowner equity in hydro dams and geothermal 
projects is 10%.
8. In view of these challenges being posed to the overall performance of 
development of energy, in terms of regulation and entrepreneurial initiatives 
on the one hand and Government Policy Imperatives on the other, this 
policy proposes to initiate reforms into the State’s participation in business 
through its wholly owned PPL, and the regulatory regime existing at this 
time. The efforts under this policy would position the industry to develop 
further into a viable and competitive market, to the benefit of the users of 
energy and electricity, and the private participants in the industry.
7.3 UNBUNDLING OF PNG POWER LIMITED
1. The State (GoPNG) will unbundle the current PPL into distinct entities 
operating in the Generation, Transmission, Distribution and Retail and 
Regulations. The government’s competition policy initiative is one component 
of this effort at unbundling to improve regulatory oversight and competiveness 
of the company and industry as a whole. 
2. The unbundling is predicated on the fundamental principles of:
(a) Public Private Partnership (PPP); 
(b) Landowner Participation that will be guided by Landowner Participation
Policy assuring at least 10% Landowner stake in all major hydro and 
geothermal projects; 
(c) Ensuring competition in and for the market, through eliminating 
avenues where exist for potential abuse of market position against 
market players; and 
(d) Maintain state monopoly in transmission where privatising and 
competition does not make economic and practical sense. 
3. Because of the enormity of the initiative, the unbundling process will be 
undertaken in two phases. Phase 1 involves the stabilisation and 
consolidation of PPL Regional Power Business Units. It is intended to stabilise 
the situation in PPL and then to consolidate the existing business units to 
optimize efficiency for cost savings and improve profitability. During Phase 1, 
the major value-chain components of PPL are consolidated into various core functions at the regional level to ensure preparation for a smooth transition 
into PPLs future entities. Consolidation of the existing businesses will follow 
the Regional Model for rehabilitation of the existing regional business units of 
PPL according to the expert analysis by the PNG Power Sector. These 
include all aspects of the value chain from generation, transmission, 
distribution, retail and regulatory functions of the current PPL assets and 
businesses. Within this phase the core businesses and support services are 
clearly identified and structures put in place. Research & Development and 
Commercial functions are now included as vital parts that will drive the 
direction of PPL in future.
4. Phase 2 involves creation of specialized business entities as part of the 
National Government’s Kumul Consolidation agenda, with a holding company, 
a trust company and several subsidiary generation companies to be 
incorporated by the State.
5. The Regional Model will empower regional growth centres to operate on 
competitive terms to attract and promote regional business initiatives. When 
the National Transmission Grid is in place then the regional power generation 
can be supplied to consumers in any part of the country.
6. The Department responsible for Public Enterprises & State Investments, as it 
relates to the electricity industry, shall cause to be undertaken a review into 
the current regulatory environment in the energy industry, with a particular 
focus to secure a more efficient electricity regulatory regime that would relieve 
PNG Power Limited of its regulatory functions delegated to it under the 
Electricity Industry Act. This would essentially involve considerations of the 
mandates of the following regulatory and policy institutions:
(a) Independent Consumer & Competition Commission (ICCC).
(b) Department of Petroleum & Energy (DP&E).
(c) Independent Public Business Corporation (IPBC).
7. The planning implication of the restructure includes: (i) an organization with 
background experience in company restructure and change management will 
be required to manage the unbundling of PPL and with oversight by the 
Minister for Public Enterprises and State Investments' appointed project 
management team; and (ii) The procedure for PPL unbundling begins with the 
transfer of PPL assets and liabilities to IPBC or an interim company owned by 
IPBC through an Assets transfer program, followed by its subsequent transfer to the new power entity. The new companies start with clean balance sheets 
after outstanding arrears of the PPL are cleared.
8. In terms of legal implications of the restructure, while the regional power 
entities will operate as autonomous business units within the existing PPL 
legislation with internal corporate restructuring; the new power entities will 
operate as new companies under the Companies Act 1997 and appropriate 
enabling legislation (Electricity Industry Act (Chapter 78) consolidated to No 
10 of 2002) regarding electricity generation, transmission-distribution and 
retailing require review and amendment. Related Acts include:
(a) Electricity Industry Act (Chapter 78) consolidated to No 10 of 2002.
(b) IPBC Act 2002 (Consolidated / Copy of 15th May 2012) 07 August 
2012.
(c) Companies Act 1997 consolidated to No 66 of 2000.
9. The restructuring of PPL is critical in releasing the full potential of the PNG 
Energy Industry in contributing towards economic growth and prosperity. The 
measures will not only increase power generation towards the 9000MW, but 
also make transmission, distribution and retailing efficient and competitive.
10.The Energy Policy is cognisant of the fact that there are many developments 
that lie beyond this 2 phase restructure following successful models around 
the world including: 
(a) Trading of power entities on a stock exchange, 
(b) An IPP trading market in Port Moresby and on a smaller scale in Lae to 
generate competition and provide good power prices for the 
consumers, 
(c) Independent Regulating Authority in place, 
(d) Retailing business capacity support from power entities, 
(e) Harnessing of other energy sources, 
(f) Use of clean coal technology in the future, 
(g) Carbon Trading bonuses for the Power Entities, and 
(h) Research and Development setting and leading the power entities' 
businesses focus.8 INDIGENOUS PARTICIPATION IN THE ENERGY SECTOR

8.2.1 BACKGROUND
1. National Content refers to the procurement or sourcing of goods and services 
from domestic and international sources by a Nationally Owned Company 
engaged by a Energy Project Developer Company.
2. Nationally Owned Companies are those companies which are majority owned 
(51 % +) by the citizens of Papua New Guinea or SOEs.
3. The concept of National Content is to enable or encourage more nationally 
owned companies to participate as sub-contractors or otherwise, hence 
creating more business and employment opportunities within the 
domestic/national economy. 
4. National content also includes employment of national citizens in various skills 
level in any (energy) project (which will be covered adequately in the subChapter on Human Resource Capacity Building in Energy Projects).
5. The recent LNG Project participants include some nationally owned 
companies, SOEs mostly, like Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited (formerly 
National Petroleum Company of PNG), Petromin (PNG) Holdings 
Limited(through its subsidiary Eda Oil limited), Mineral Resources 
Development Corporation and Oilsearch Limited(10 % owned by IPBC).
6. Most major hydro projects in the country are owned by the SOE PNG Power 
Limited.
7. The Mineral Resources Development Corporation (MRDC) participates 
through the collection of landowner royalties. 
8. The National Gas Corporation was statutorily created to provide for all 
provinces equal participation in major hydrocarbons development but has 
been under capitalised to date resulting in lack of its participation in Projects. 8.2.2 CHALLENGES
1. Absence of a National Content Plan or Policy.
2. Inadequate capacity and capabilities of Locally Owned companies for 
technically complex tasks.
3. Lack of funding and finance for nationally owned companies to participate in 
energy projects.
4. Lack of funding and finance for locally owned companies.

structure themselves commercially to participate in Projects.
10.Priority to be given to SOE’s (Kumul Petroleum Holdings Company and 
National Gas Corporation in oil and gas sector) to participate for the collective 
benefit of the nation.
8.3 DOWNSTREAM PROCESSING IN THE PETROLEUM SECTOR
8.3.1 BACKGROUND
1. Papua New Guinea is strategically located in a region where both oil and gas 
reserves are abundant, i.e. within the Asian/Pacific region which comprises 
countries such as Australia, Malaysia, Brunei, and Indonesia. These countries 
have established world class petroleum and associate industries such as 
LNG, Methanol and Petrochemicals by effectively utilizing their petroleum 
resources. They also compete against each other in order to secure as much 
market share in the region and at the global scenario. In the Asia Pacific 
region buyers are driving hard bargain in price to take advantage of the 
increase of supply in the LNG markets Products such as Compressed Natural 
gas (LNG) and Dimethyl ether (DME) are expected to increase in competition 
with other well established fuel. Competitiveness in costs and environmental 
factors are key factors to securing products markets, and attracting by 
investors. 
2. In order for PNG to be able to be competitive and secure leadership in such 
highly competitive Asia/Pacific regional markets and also attract potential 
investors, it is of critical importance that the Government formulates an attractive policy directive targeting investments in Downstream Processing in 
the Petroleum Sector (Oil & Gas).
3. PNG Petroleum Sector must support the growth of a vibrant downstream 
sector which will in turn provide a strong foundation for large-scale 
downstream processing. This will in turn enhance Gas-based activities in a 
sustainable and environmentally friendly and safe approach, hence:
a) Building a foundation of strong revenue base hence maximises 
economic benefits;
b) Secure energy security;
c) Enhance growth and experience to the natural economy;
d) Reduce high dependence on expensive imported fuel and petro 
chemical products and encourage local cheap substitutes (refer also to 
Domestic Market Obligation-DMO);
e) Attract the interest of Investors in the increase of exploration in the 
upstream hydrocarbon industry;
f) Creation of more job in the hydrocarbon industry for our citizen (refer 
also to local content); and
g) Address poverty alleviation.
4. The current Government’s focus to promote investments in the local content 
in downstream activities is more than monitoring direct monetary benefits. The 
promotion of downstream processing support the Overarching National 
Energy Policy to grow the economy as reflected in the Government’s 
Development Strategic Plan (DSP) and Vision 2050. This will encourage the 
procurement of products and services and utilising local sub-contractors for 
the purpose of provision of goods and services to the projects and act as a 
major boost to the economy. This will maximise the Government’s gains as a 
result of the economy multiplier effects triggered by the (Energy) Project’s 
downstream activities.
5. The current low price for LNG which will persist for foreseeable future.
8.3.2 CHALLENGES 
1. The lack of a Downstream Processing Policy/Plan for (Energy) Projects.
2. The lack of reliable infrastructure and associated works to supply energy to 
power industrialisation/downstream processing of hydrocarbons.
3. The lack of trained and skilled manpower/personnel.4. The lack of finance and fiscal incentives for potential developers to 
downstream process.
5. The lack of a Domestic Market Obligations Policy /Plan to secure gas 
reserves for downstream processing. (see sub-Chapter on Domestic Market 
Obligations below) 
8.3.3 STRATEGIES
1. Formulation of a Downstream Processing Policy/Plan to address downstream 
processing.
2. The Overarching Energy Policy will itself address issues relating to reliable 
energy supply.
3. The sub-Chapter on Human Resource Capacity Building chapter will address 
the lack of trained manpower/personnel.
4. Formulation of good fiscal regime/incentives for potential developers.
5. Use joint venture arrangements between reputable developers/proponents 
and nationally owned companies to downstream.
6. Formulation of a Domestic Market Obligations Policy/Plan to address 
downstream processing.
7. Ensure that Domestic Market Obligations component is factored into every 
(Energy) Agreement into between the State and Developers.
8. Enforcement of Domestic Market Obligations component in the Oil and Gas 
Act and if possible to increase the amount of petroleum available for Domestic 
Market Obligations.
8.4 DOMESTIC MARKET OBLIGATIONS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR
8.4.1 BACKGROUND
1. Domestic Market Obligation is used to assign/reserve a certain percentage of 
processed petroleum for local/domestic consumption.2. It is vital in that higher end products may be manufactured from gas secured 
under the Domestic Market Obligations.
3. Almost all the gas recovered under the PNGLNG Project was committed 
under long- term sales arrangements with international consumers leaving 
little available for Domestic Market Obligations. As a result, there are none 
available for Domestic Market Obligations to be utilised in electricity 
generation and petrochemical production.
4. It is hoped that a more robust system be in place to enforce what is already 
contained in the Oil and Gas Act. 
8.4.2 CHALLENGES 
1. The lack of a Domestic Market Obligations Policy.
2. The lack of enforcement of what is provided for under the Oil and Gas Act.
8.4.3 STRATEGIES
1. Formulation of a Domestic Market Obligations Policy for Petroleum.
2. Enforcement of Domestic Market Obligations component in the Oil and Gas 
Act.
8.5 ENERGY PROJECT REHABILATION
8.5.1 BACKGROUND
1. Projects involving Energy use varying amounts of finite resources like water 
and land. For instance, drilling and exploring for oil and gas uses less land 
than say coal or uranium mining.
2. Likewise producing energy from Geothermal plants uses less land/space and 
water than a hydro dam and its reservoir.
3. Some may cause minimal disruption to the local ecosystem like solar and 
wind turbines. Some may be eco-friendly in that they uses waste products to 
produce energy like biofuels from cooking oil whereas some are not like 
producing of energy from nuclear plants and the accompanying hazardous 
wastes.
4. All in all, the rehabilitation of the environment after these projects have come 
to the end of their life is crucial.5. In Papua New Guinea, most petroleum projects leave little environmental 
footprint. There are no major mining of coal and uranium as yet. Experience 
from mining projects especially Ok Tedi, Panguna and Misima leave a lot to 
be desired. Mining of coal and uranium, if they do happen, must not follow this 
path.
6. Rehabilitation of hydro reservoirs has not yet been experienced since these 
projects are currently operational.
7. Solar and wind are harnessed but on a much smaller scale and not industrial.
8. Biofuel is yet to take off on a large scale. Its production from plantations, 
smallholders, etc. then needs to be taken into account as they will leave an 
environmental footprint.
9. Biomass is also one sector that leaves a big footprint. The Forests Act and 
levy uses funds to rehabilitate the forest and grow plantation timber.
8.5.1 CHALLENGES 
1. No regulatory framework to cover rehabilitation of energy projects
8.5.1 STRATEGIES
1. Legislations and regulations to be enacted to better regulate the rehabilitation 
of energy projects.
8.6 HUMAN RESOURCE CAPACITY BUILDING FOR ENERGY PROJECTS
8.6.1 BACKGROUND
1. All facets of energy development, production, usage and conservation need a 
trained pool of people to manage.
2. Technical people like Petroleum and nuclear engineers, geologists are 
needed mostly in the operational areas of energy.
3. In addition, good quality energy policy analysts, etc. are needed.
4. PNG currently has no specific training related directly to energy. However, 
there a recent moves by the UPNG to introduce the Bachelor of Sustainable Development which contain aspects of climate change and energy 
conservation.
5. There were recent moves by the WNBP Governor to send mothers to India for 
Solar Academy training.
6. Most projects are required to produce a Training and Localisation Plan prior to 
developing a resource. Most do not comply with this Plan. 
8.6.2 CHALLENGES 
1. Developers lack of compliance with the Training and Localisation Plan.
2. Lack of trained researchers and academics specialised in Energy 
Development and use.
8.6.3 STRATEGIES
1. Robust enforcement and inspection by State Agencies to ensure that a 
developer adheres to a training and localization plan that it submits. 
2. Skills transfer by Developers to citizens should be made mandatory.
3. Adequate funding and training by the state for energy related training 
overseas.9 ENERGY FINANCING, TRADING, PRICING AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC 
ISSUES
9.1 BACKGROUND
1. The funding required for the energy sector is substantial. New investments 
are needed for exploration, utilization, generation, transmission and 
distribution activities. Long-term financing options that involve both foreign 
and domestic financing resources are required. However, foreign investment 
capital and national foreign earnings provide the greater proportion of 
needed funds. 
2. The Government shall continue to encourage private sector investment in 
the energy sector through Public Private Partnership (PPP). 
3. To attract foreign investment in the energy sector, certain necessary 
conditions would have to be met. Experience has shown that Independent 
Power Producers (IPPs) require incentives to mitigate the perceived political 
and economic risks. 
9.2 CHALLENGES
1. Inadequate funding for the energy sector. 
2. Lack of continuity in the funding of projects in the energy sector. 
3. Low foreign investment from a highly competitive international finance market. 
4. Partial adoption of the most cost-effective energy supply options for the 
country. 
5. Low foreign exchange earnings through export of energy. 
6. Inadequate local development of energy technologies. 
7. Lack of energy trading mechanism for spot and long term markets.
8. Foreign exchange fluctuations.
9.3 STRATEGIES–FOR ENERGY FINANCING1. The Government shall explore and adopt all viable financing options from 
local and international sources to ensure cost effective utilization of all its 
energy resources and in so doing shall endeavour to maintain a competitive 
fiscal investment climate in the country. 
2. The Government shall continue to provide financial support for energy 
infrastructure development. Such support may include: 
(a) Specialized tax concessions for domestic energy producers of 
petroleum products such as tax credits, deductions, exemptions and 
allowances and particular incentives on clean burning petroleum 
products thus encouraging adoption of clean and efficient refining 
technologies, following the discovery of commercially viable crude oil 
in Papua New Guinea.
(b) Fiscal incentives for the refining sector similar to that provided to 
refineries by governments in the Middle East and Asia. This 
recognizes the investment in infrastructure that is commonly 
accessed by the industry and benefits the entire economy. 
(c) Provision of incentives for renewable energy projects so as to reduce 
the reliance on expensive petroleum based energy in the long term. 
3. The national government shall grant appropriate fiscal incentives for energy 
expansion projects from time to time. 
4. Provide for high import duty for non-efficient energy technology while zero 
rating efficient technologies. 
5. Allow procurement of equipment for exploration, exploitation and 
development of energy sources related spares and accessories free of duty 
and taxes. 
6. Allow procurement of plant, equipment and related accessories for 
generation and transmission projects free of duty and taxes during project 
implementation. Procurement of major parts for the power plants, 
transmission and distribution systems and materials shall also be exempted 
from duty and taxes. 
7. Support public generators in joint venture partnerships in situations where 
the IPPs will be unwilling to participate in development of energy production 
projects without Government participation due to perceived project risks. 8. Grant tax holiday to investors in exploration, production and processing of 
coal and petroleum for a period of between 5 and 10 years depending on 
size of investment. 
9. Dedicating a certain percentage of the nation’s income from conventional 
energy sub-sector to support training, research, development demonstration 
and technology acquisition.
10.Providing fiscal incentives for prospective investors in energy.
11.Reviewing the existing laws and regulations for the operation of energy 
sector industries so as to increase private sector participation in the 
industries.
12.Ensuring a reasonable return on investments through cost-effective energy 
pricing. 
13.Establishing guaranteed and dependable repayment schemes for loans 
invested in energy projects.
9.4 ENERGY FINANCING OPTIONS
1. Establishing a favourable investment climate to attract investments in the 
energy sector. 
2. Providing adequate infrastructural facilities to enterprises involved in the 
development of the energy sector. 
3. Encouraging energy firms to source development funds from alternative 
sources. 
4. Expanding the scope of venture capital financing to embrace investments in 
the energy sector. 
5. An Electrification Trust Fund is proposed to solicit and fund rural electrification 
project proposals across the country. This will make rural electrification an 
active national policy, and will ensure equity, effective coordination and 
sustainability.6. Review the Income Tax Act 1959, Goods Act 1951, the Goods & Services 
Tax Act 2003 and other relevant legislations, to provide fiscal incentives in the 
energy sector. 
7. Develop a National Energy trading market in the country including spot and 
long term markets for energy products. 
8. Encourage development partners to establish financial facilities for financing 
energy related projects at minimal interest rates especially for renewable 
energy and energy efficiency projects.
9. Provide incentives to attract investment in petroleum retail networks in the
remote areas of the country. 
10.Seek financing of clean energy projects through carbon credits under clean 
development mechanism green energy through relevant government 
agencies. 
11.The provincial governments will be encouraged to source for their own 
funding for energy projects within their mandate according to Organic Law 
and National Government support. 
12.Encourage public private partnerships in energy projects including strategic 
petroleum reserves infrastructure development and power generation 
projects. 
9.4.1 PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS
1. The Government will support Public Private Partnership (PPP) as provided 
for in the PPP Policy document. Systems have been set for participation of 
private sector in financing, construction, development, operation, or 
maintenance of infrastructure or development projects through concession or 
other contractual arrangements and the establishment of institutions to 
regulate monitor and supervise project agreements or infrastructure or 
development projects.
2. Apart from market-driven competition, the Government recognizes private 
sector participation to occur in the form of service contracts lasting between 
1 – 2 years, management contracts of a 3 - 5 year term, leases from 8 - 15 years, concessions which duration range from 25 - 30 years and other forms 
(models) of public-private partnerships (PPP) such as service-operatetransfer (SOT) or build-operate-transfer (BOT) that should have a term 
between 20 – 30 years.
3. All PPP’s formed shall be the outcome of a competitive bidding process, and 
vetted by the relevant regulator. The State currently has a National PPP 
policy to guide such decisions, and the National Energy Policy will be 
implemented in a manner consistent with that policy.
9.4.2 CONSOLIDATED ENERGY FUND
1. The Government shall set up a Consolidated Energy Fund (CONSEF) under 
the National Energy Authority to cater for the following: -
(a) Acquisition of strategic petroleum reserves and the construction of the 
appropriate infrastructure. 
(b) Assist in energy sector environmental disaster mitigation, response and 
recovery. 
(c) Hydro risk mitigation during times of prolonged drought. 
(d) Promotion of renewable energy initiatives. 
2. The sources of the money for this energy fund will be as below: 
(a) Levies and license fees in the energy sector except those with specific 
purposes. 
(b) Contribution from energy sector player.
(c) Contribution from public institutions for the discharge of their mandates. 
(d) Raising funds through the stock market (bonds and bills). 
3. The fund shall be managed by the proposed National Energy Authority. 
9.5 ENERGY TRADING
1 Electricity is a commodity capable of being bought, sold and traded in an 
electricity market. However Electricity unlike other products is by its nature 
difficult to store and has to be available on demand. Therefore there is a 
physical requirement for a controlling agency, the transmission system 
operator, to coordinate the dispatch of generating units to meet the expected demand of the system across the transmission grid. Under this policy, it is 
envisaged that the ENERCOM will perform that role.
2 National Electricity Market involves both wholesale generation that is 
transported via interconnected grid of high voltage transmission lines to 
electricity distributors, who deliver it to consumers (homes and businesses).
3 The transport of electricity from generators to consumers is facilitated through 
a ‘pool’, or spot market, where the output from all generators is aggregated 
and scheduled at five minute intervals to meet demand.
4 The pool is not a physical thing but a set of procedures that ENERCOM will 
manages in line with National Electricity Law and National Electricity Rules.
5 The market uses sophisticated systems to send signals to generators 
instructing them how much energy to produce each five minutes so that 
production is matched to consumer requirements, spare capacity is kept 
ready for emergencies, and the current energy price can be calculated.
6 The scope of each electricity market consists of the transmission grid or 
network that is available to the wholesalers, retailers and the ultimate 
consumers in any geographic area.
7 A wholesale electricity market exists when competing generators offer their 
electricity output to retailers. The retailers then re-price the electricity and take 
it to market. Large end-users seeking to cut out unnecessary overhead in their 
energy costs are beginning to recognize the advantages inherent in such a 
purchasing move.
9.6 ENERGY PRICING AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC ISSUES
9.6.1 ENERGY PRICING
9.6.1.1 ELECTRICITY
1. Electricity pricing shall base on the principles of Long Run Marginal Cost of 
supply. The End-User-Tariff incorporates all prudent costs in the value chain 
and a fair return to the investors. The bulk tariffs are negotiated between 
producers and the off-taker, however, the Power Purchase Agreement is subject to approval by ICCC. The retail tariffs are regulated by the 
Commission and may be subject to review at least every five years.
2. Fuel costs and exchange rates gains/losses are pass-through costs in the 
current regime. These account for power cost variations in the event of 
fluctuation in the international crude oil prices as well as instability with PNG 
Kina against foreign currencies, mainly the US Dollar. 
3. PNG imports some petroleum products from overseas. The international 
price of crude oil and petroleum products has been on a steady increase and 
has had an impact on the cost of petroleum and associated products.
4. The impact of crude oil price increases lead to inflationary pressure in the 
economy which is translated to increases in prices of goods and services. 
This tends to depreciate the exchange rate and increase interest rates. An 
increase in diesel prices leads to an increase in farming costs, the cost of 
inputs in the manufacturing and transport sectors and subsequently an 
increase in consumer prices making PNG products uncompetitive. With the 
income of consumers remaining relatively constant, these increases lead to 
erosion of purchasing power of the consumers in addition to reducing monies 
for other needs. 
9.6.1.2 AFFORDABLE ENERGY PRICE
1. The reliability of energy services enjoyed by the urban energy users is 
unreliable by international standards because of the way the energy sector is 
structured in the country. The condition of modern energy infrastructure in 
PNG is in a deplorable state and needs to be maintained, upgraded or 
replaced to ensure that these facilities perform to the highest expectations to 
deliver the energy services required by the end users. 
2. Demand for production and utilization of energy is a function of price. It is 
important to take into consideration the low ability of paying energy users 
amongst large sections of the population. 
3. When developing or constructing modern energy infrastructure it is essential 
that the developers must consider imposing affordable energy price to the 
consumers. The developers must consider appropriate cost savings in the 
designs of the energy infrastructure through improved operating efficiencies 
and minimizing on unnecessary expenditure.4. Incentives that make energy developers seek efficiency measures to minimize 
their costs and an enforceable and suitable price mechanism should alleviate 
the situations that bring about unaffordable prices of energy services.
9.6.1.3 COMPETITIVE ENERGY MARKETS
1. To improve reliability of energy services competition will be promoted and 
introduced in the energy sector. Competition in energy supply provides 
choice to consumers, places downwards pressure on prices and incentivizes 
efficient investment. 
2. The government will push for reforms and initiate programmes for ensuring 
energy markets continue to work effectively and competition is promoted.
3. Create an open market by way of withholding two quarter (2/4) of fossil fuels 
exporting overseas and refines it within the country so as to meet its energy 
demand.
4. Tariff regulation, as a second best option to competitive markets would 
continue to play an important role in ensuring an affordable and reliable 
energy to end users.
9.6.1.4 OVERSEEING OIL MARKET
1. The petrol and diesel prices are largely determined by international oil 
markets. However the government will oversee oil markets to ensure petrol 
and diesel prices at the pump fairly reflect industry costs as per international 
oil market.
2. Similar to the gas sector, oil commercialization and development will be 
promoted in PNG in the near future to reduce reliance on fuel imports and 
promote energy security.
9.6.2 OTHER SOCIO-ECONOMIC ISSUES
1. Investment in property relating to exploitation of natural resources for energy 
production must benefit the local communities and their economies as well 
as future generations. Therefore there is need to provide: a. A framework to ensure that local communities benefit from energy 
resources within their region.
b. A funded, national coordinated rural electrification program is 
required.
A National Electrification Consolidated Trust Fund (NECTF) is 
proposed to solicit and fund rural electrification project proposals 
across the country. This will make rural electrification an active 
national policy, and will ensure equity, effective coordination and 
sustainability.
9.7 THE TARIFFS AND PRICING MECHANISMS
9.7.1 BACKGROUND
1. Papua New Guinea (PNG) has a low electrification rate compared to other 
similar developing countries whilst the sector has a vertically integrated 
monopoly with a few independent power producers. Given such a scenario, 
PNG has developed and now had in place its own electricity sector policies. 
Since there are provisions in the regulatory licencing framework for private 
sector participation, these arrangements can be combined with some 
elements by learning through the reformed experiences of other developing 
countries that could be considered for the way forward in reforming the 
sector’s regulation, thus encouraging competition to improve efficiency in the 
provision of electricity services. 
2. As such, given that there are potential for more competition in the electricity 
sector with increasing number of interest shown by the private sector to 
participate on the back end of high demand for electricity due to increase 
economic activities, the regulatory arrangements and tariff structuring will 
provide provisions for continuous restructuring and adjustment overtime, 
concurrent with the development in the electricity industry. 3. Therefore, to accommodate the increasing interests shown by the private 
sector to participate in all or any of the segments of the electricity sector, 
certain form of pricing mechanism or tariff structure need to be set in place to 
provide and or administer the returns on the value of investments.
4. The ERC must be encourage through the existing regulatory framework to 
implement a robust price mechanism that is conducive to and or favourable 
for all entrants into the different segments of the industry, to gain a positive 
return on their investments thus promoting accessibility, affordability and 
reliability in the industry. 
5. Furthermore, ERC must consider the different areas of operations, in terms of 
the urban and rural settings, and the respective low and high cost areas; and 
apply different charges at those varying connection(s) points with those 
parties, albeit set an appropriate price mechanism and or tariff structure that 
will drive efficiency. 
6. More so, in order to achieve the overarching objectives of this policy; apart 
from other strategies, there is considerable need for structuring and setting of 
pricing mechanism. Any proposed price mechanism should be reviewed and 
structured concurrently with the phase of the restructuring or defragmentation 
of the electricity industry. 
7. Currently there exists a Tariff structure that is applied specifically by the 
regulated retailer. PNG Power Limited, being the regulated retailer applies a 
uniform tariff across its entire network. 
8. Distinctively, there are some price mechanisms currently applicable through 
third parties access that are covered by the Third Party Access Code (TPA). 
However, in observing how the current pricing mechanism in the industry works, it may not be fully reflective of the different structure of the restructured 
electricity industry. 
9. Therefore, the different tariff structure for different settings of the 
defragmented sectors of the electricity industry must be established. In 
essence the policy is making provision for the establishment of different tariff 
structure for different defragmented sectors of the industry and provides 
provision for adjustment and review of the tariff structures to be on par with 
the structuring of the industry overtime. 
9.7.2 TARIFF IN ELECTRICITY
1. In consideration of the complexity involved in the tariff calculation and design, 
especially in regards to obtaining of relevant efficient costs inputs of the firms 
in question, and the asymmetry of information between the regulator and the 
regulated entity; an efficient market tariff price cannot be easily determined. 
Nonetheless, regulation of price to mimic the competitive market has 
continued to be adopted worldwide as the second best option. 
2. The current Papua New Guinea electricity tariff setting arrangements can be 
best illustrated in the following diagram hereunder.
3. T1, T2, and T3 are the three different points at which the tariffs are charged. T1
is the tariff agreed between the IPP and the Off-taker. T2 is the potential tariff 
for a transmission company charged to and bought by the distribution 
company. T3 is the retail tariff charged by the distributor to the retail 
customers. 
4. A large proportion of tariff differentials occur at T3, under price discrimination 
and segmenting due to the varied customer segments - such as industrial, 
GENERATION TRANSMISSION DISTRIBUTION RETAIL T1 T2 T3household and residential and public institutions. A similar price differentials 
occur at T1, due to the varied costs structures of the generating firms resulting 
in different tariff rates. This is the case given that all firms operating in the 
industry would not necessarily have similar cost structures.
5. The current electricity tariff pricing regime administered by the Independent 
Consumer Competition Commission (ICCC) under its own Act (ICCC Act, No 
6 of 2002), the economic regulator of the electricity industry focuses on tariffs 
charged at point T3 with an oversight on T1. The principle behind it, is for the 
firm to recover its efficient costs of investment, with a reasonable return on its 
investments. 
6. Tariff between the IPPs and Off-taker in T1 remains negotiable between the 
parties, through a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). However, the ICCC 
does have an oversight in setting of the Reference Price, agreed to it by the 
Regulator, based on information supplied to it by the regulated entity 
(Retailer). This is consistent with the pricing arrangements provided for under 
the Third Party Access Code (TPA Code).9.7.3 PRICING MECHANISM UNDER THE TPA CODE
9.7.3.1 THE THIRD PARTY ACCESS CODE
1. The Third Party Access Code and Grid Code was developed through the 
Electricity Industry Policy. The TPA Code was released by ICCC and became 
effective on the 1st of January 2014. The objective of the TPA was to facilitate 
improved access, reliability and affordability of electricity throughout PNG by:
 Improving the reliability of electricity supply by supporting entry by 
Independent Power Producers (IPPs) to ensure sufficient generating 
capacity is available for dispatch.
 Helping to ensure that power is more affordable for customers by 
increasing the range of potential generation options and, thereby, 
offering more opportunities for the System Operator to select least-cost 
generation options.
 Helping to ensure that power is more affordable for customers by 
increasing the range of potential retailers and, thereby, offering more 
opportunities for Large Load Customers to select a least-cost option.
9.7.3.2 KEY COMPONENTS OF THE ACCESS CODE
1. There are three key components of the TPA Code in relation to tariff settings; 
these are:
(a) Reference Prices - which set out the maximum price a regulated 
retailer will pay for electricity generation;
(b) Wheeling Arrangements - which set out the conditions and charges 
under which third parties can access PNG Power Limited’s 
transmission networks; and
(c) Connections arrangements - which set out the conditions and 
charges for connection to PNG Power Limited’s transmission networks 
by third parties.
2. The TPA Code, once implemented is expected to: (a) Improve transparency with regards to power purchase contracting 
between IPPs and Regulated Retailers.
(b) Constrains the ability of Regulated Retailers to unfairly discriminate 
against potential competitors.
(c) Protect Transmission Network Operators’ commercial interests by 
clarifying how they are remunerated by Third Parties connecting to and 
wheeling power through their network.
(d) Constrains the ability of Transmission Network Operator/s that 
performs System Operator functions from unfairly discriminating 
against Third Parties.
9.7.3.3 PRICING MECHANISMS UNDER THE TPA CODE
1. The TPA Code and its Pricing Mechanism aligned to the National Energy 
Policy are expounded as: 
i. Power Purchase Reference Pricing and Power Purchase Agreement
The Power Purchase Reference Price (PPRP) provides for purchasing 
power at a prudent and efficient cost for the retailer to pass-through to 
consumers. The power purchase price sets the upper bound for and as a 
benchmark for retailers purchasing from power producers.
It is required under the TPA Code that regulated retailers must submit a 
statement of power purchase reference price to the regulator for approval. 
The regulator will assess, approve and do publication of the approved 
power purchase reference prices for the participants in the industry to 
apply these references accordingly to the different energy sources. 
ii. Wheeling Arrangement and Charges
According to the TPA Code, the Transmission Network Owner must 
provide non-discriminatory rights to use or access its transmission network 
to third parties for the purpose of supplying large load customer. Third parties wheeling power through the transmission network must pay 
wheeling charges to the transmission network operator. 
The transmission network owner or the regulated retailer is also required 
under the TPA Code to submit a Statement of Wheeling Arrangements 
and Charges to the regulator to approve before the regulated retailer of the 
third party is allowed to use transmission network for wheeling. 
iii. Connection Procedures and Charges
According to the TPA Code, the Transmission Network Owner must 
provide non-discriminatory connection to its transmission network to any 
including but not limited for IPPs for the purpose of;
(a) Third party to supply power to the regulated retailer or network 
owner in order to effect the power purchase agreements 
between third party and the regulated retailer;
(b) Third party to wheel power through the transmission network to 
a large load customer with in the exclusive service areas of the 
regulated retailer. 
2. Before connecting any third party, a Statement of Connection Service (SoCS) 
procedures and charges must be prepared by the regulated retailer and 
presented to the regulator for approval. 
3. Thus, any third party willing to connect to the network must pay for the 
connection charges and connection services charges in accordance with the 
approved SoCS procedures and charges. 
9.7.3.4 CHALLENGES FACING PAPUA NEW GUINEA IN TARIFF SETTING
1. Acute shortage of generation capacity; 
2. Transmission constraints and inadequacies; 3. Inadequate generation mix e.g. solar, wind, coal, etc; 
4. Unacceptable technical and non-technical loss levels; and 
5. Information Asymmetry between regulator and regulated entity
6. Lack of publicly available data and information.
7. Lack of institutional capacity and resources.
9.7.3.5 TARRIF SETTING PRINCIPLES
1. That the proposed National Energy Authority of Papua New Guinea (NEA) 
upon setting the tariff, should have regard to ensure that the prices charged 
by licensees are fair to consumers and sufficient to allow the licensees finance 
their activities and to allow for reasonable earnings for efficient operation.
2. The proposed NEA, must design an appropriate tariff structure, and set out 
multiyear tariff for the electricity industry, subjecting it to review at appropriate 
terms, as it sees fit.
3. An open and transparent public process of consultation is adopted, with a 
holistic and scientific approach to balancing electricity tariffs to ensure a fair 
and cost-reflective tariff regime capable of supporting the growth of the 
industry, whilst attracting new investment into the sector. 
4. The key principles that the National Energy Authority of Papua New Guinea 
(NEA) need to be cognisant of in terms of setting the tariffs for each of the 
generation, transmission and distribution (including retail) sectors, are: 
(a) Cost recovery / financial viability – regulated entities should be 
permitted to recover their (efficient) costs, including a reasonable 
rate of return on capital. (b) Signals for investment – prices should encourage an efficient 
level and nature of investment (e.g., location) in the industry. 
(c) Certainty and stability of the pricing framework is also important 
for private sector investment. 
(d) Efficient use of the network – generally, this requires “efficient” 
prices that reflect the marginal costs that users impose on the 
system and the reduction of cross-subsidies. 
(e) Allocation of risk – pricing arrangements should allocate risks 
efficiently (generally to those who are best placed to manage 
them). 
(f) Simplicity and cost-effectiveness – the tariff structure and 
regulatory system should be easy to understand and not 
excessively costly to implement (e.g., facilitate metering and 
billing). 
(g) Incentives for improving performance – the way in which prices 
are regulated should give appropriate incentives for operators to 
reduce costs and/or increase quality of service. 
(h) Transparency / fairness – prices should be non-discriminatory 
and transparent. Non-discriminatory access to monopoly networks 
is also a key prerequisite for effective competition in the 
contestable sectors. 
(i) Flexibility / robustness – the pricing framework needs to be able 
to cater for unforeseen changes in circumstances. 
(j) Social and political objectives – the pricing framework needs to 
provide for the achievement of social policy goals such as 
universal access, demand-side management and user 
affordability. 
9.7.4 FEED IN TARIFF
9.7.4.1 OVERVIEW1. FiT is a convenient tool for many countries, that is strongly recommended 
for PNG to encourage renewable energy generation.
2. Feed-in tariffs (FIT) are fixed electricity prices that are paid to renewable 
energy (RE) producers for each unit of energy produced and injected into 
the electricity grid. The payment of the FIT is guaranteed for a certain 
period of time that is often related to the economic lifetime of the 
respective RE project (usually between 15-25 years). Another possibility is 
to calculate a fixed maximum amount of full-load hours of RE electricity 
production for which the FIT will be paid. FIT are usually paid by electricity 
grid, system or market operators, often in the context of Power Purchasing 
Agreements (PPA).
3. Most RE support schemes, the level of FIT is determined on the basis of a 
calculation of the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) produced from RE. 
This allows the RE investor to recover the different costs (capital, O&M, 
fuel, financing) while realizing a return on his investment that depends on 
the assumed financing costs. In some cases, FIT have been calculated on 
the basis of avoided costs for the electricity system or the society, 
including e.g. environmental externalities. Thirdly, it is also possible to 
determine the FIT level by means of a tendering mechanism.
9.7.4.2 DESIGN OPTIONS
1. FIT are usually differentiated by technology to reflect the differences in 
generation costs between the various RE technologies. A second 
differentiation is also often done for the size of the RE project in terms of 
installed capacity, reflecting the higher generation costs of small and medium 
scale RE projects. Thirdly, FIT can be differentiated according to the RE 
resource quality (e.g. average wind speed) at different project locations. In 
this case, FIT for sites with lower RE potential are higher than those for sites 
with a better RE potential. In general, these options for FIT differentiation can 
lead to a more heterogeneous mix of different RE projects (in terms of 
technologies, size and location) but carry the risk of increasing the overall 
costs of the support scheme (NREL 2010).2. In many FIT schemes, RE investors are also eligible for the payment of 
additional bonuses (i.e. an increase of the basic FIT) for the use of certain 
biomass fuels (e.g. liquid manure), combined heat and power generation 
(CHP), repowering of older RE installations, provision of ancillary services to 
the electricity system or specific innovative applications (e.g. enhanced 
geothermal systems). On the one hand, these bonuses can be useful to 
achieve certain policy objectives (e.g. technological innovation), on the other 
hand they also increase the costs of the support scheme.
3. FIT are usually stable during the whole guaranteed payment period after the 
commissioning of a RE project. In some cases, a higher FIT is paid in the first 
years of operation and a lower FIT for the remaining years. This “front-loaded” 
FIT can facilitate the financing of capital-intensive RE projects. In other cases, 
FIT are increased on an annual basis to compensate for the inflation of 
operation and maintenance costs.
4. The levels of FIT are usually determined by means of RE legislation or by 
national regulatory authorities. This means that a revision of the FIT would 
normally require an additional administrative act. Therefore, many RE support 
schemes have included an automatic degression mechanism that is applied to 
the FIT in regular intervals. This degression can be pre-determined (e.g. a 
fixed annual percentage reduction of the FIT) or it can be responsive, taking 
into consideration the market development for a specific RE technology.
5. For the calculation of the degression of the RES remuneration rates, data 
from international studies with projections about the technological progress, 
market development and the evolution of the technology costs (“learning 
curves”) are being used. The determination of the right degression rate can be 
challenging due to uncertainties concerning the technology development and 
other important factors such as financing costs.9.7.4.3 ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF FEED-IN TARIFFS
1. Feed-in tariffs are a relatively simple RES policy instrument that provides 
however the possibility to be combined with specific design elements (in 
particular tariff differentiation) that allow a fine-tuning of the support and the 
achievement of different policy objectives (e.g. innovation, climate protection, 
regional development, etc.). For RES investors and financing institutions, the 
existence of FIT combined with long-term contracts guaranteed by the 
government provides transparency, predictability and security and therefore 
contributes to lowering investment risks and financing costs. The existence of FIT 
generally also contributes to a more continuous and stable RES market 
development. FIT provide an incentive to maximize the production of RES 
electricity because they are output-based. In many countries, they have proven 
their ability to stimulate rapid and large-scale RES market development as well 
as the development of less mature RES technologies and the participation of 
small and medium scale RES electricity producers.
2. The main challenge with FIT has been the definition of remuneration levels which 
are neither too low to be attractive for investments, neither too high in order to 
avoid overcompensation (“windfall profits”) and a market development that leads 
to the escalation of costs of the RE support scheme or to technical problems with 
the electricity system. Therefore, a good knowledge and monitoring of the actual 
costs of RE projects is required. In many cases, FIT have not been set at the 
right levels due to the problem of information asymmetry between the public and 
private sector as well as political influence during the FIT determination.
3. FIT schemes without degression have proven to have a rather slow reaction time 
to rapid changes in RE costs (e.g. the cost reductions of photovoltaic systems 
during the past few years). Even if there is a degression mechanism, the 
degression might be set at a level that does not reflect the actual development of 
RE costs. FIT also do not provide any incentive for RE operators to respond to price signals of the electricity market. Therefore, FIT schemes do not allow for an 
effective market integration of RE.
4. Feed-in tariffs have proven to be very effective in stimulating rapid and largescale development of RES. Feed-in tariffs (FIT) and feed-in premiums (FIP) 
remain the most widely adopted renewable power generation policy employed at 
the national and state/provincial levels. As of early 2014, 73 countries and 28 
states/provinces had adopted some form of FIT/FIP policy (REN 21 Renewables 
2014 Global Status Report). This has been mainly attributed to the high 
investment security that long-term guaranteed FIT is providing.
5. Papua New Guinea could start with a relatively simple design, such as a 
technology-specific FiT that is based on power generation costs. Thereby, over 
certain time period, harness with technological advancement and in consideration 
of the economies of scale, more sophisticated design options could be added
9.7.5 ENBEDDED GENERATION
1. The concept of Embedded Generation in the transmission of renewable energy 
leads to the idea of exploiting all possible renewable resources at a particular site 
i.e. the build environment, in an attempt to meet the demand load. They consists 
of two generating components, Active and Passive renewables.
2. Active renewables involves the direct conversion of renewable energy to 
electricity or heat i.e. wind turbines, photovoltaics, hydroelectric, geothermal, etc. 
3. Passive systems on the other hand is the second-hand energy, obtained from 
waste heat off of PV cells, daylighting or generally, energy obtained through any 
indirect means. 
4. Some of the advantages of Embedded Generation include: 
(a) Reduction in Transmission Losses.
Transmission of electricity over distances can incur transmission losses in the 
range of 5-7%. This figure includes losses from the transmission lines as well as substations and the associated electrical components. This is seen as a 
savings when the distance of transmission is reduced in embedded 
generation 
(b) Reduction in Construction Cost.
When the transmission distances are reduced, the construction cost of 
Substation, Transmission Towers and Right of Way would also be reduced or 
eliminated altogether. Especially in city centres where transmission is 
achieved through underground cables, there could be substantial savings 
involved as the cost of these cables can be 10 -20 times that of overhead 
lines. 
(c) Environmental Concerns.
The environmental benefits associated with embedded generation are related 
to the reduced construction in long distance transmission (substation buildings 
and transmission towers) as they involve the clearing of land and trees. 
Also a benefit of embedded generation is the Corona Effect which is 
associated with overhead transmission lines. This involves noise disturbance 
and transmission interference to the surrounding population. 
(d) Avoid Supplying Excessive Amounts of Electricity to the Grid.
The national electricity grid is saturated with supplies from existing power 
generators and by adding in extra amounts of electricity from renewable 
sources, this would only be wasted in the form of heat. It would be better if 
this generated electricity is used to satisfy a demand load as in an embedded 
generation scheme and the total energy consumption is reduced at the point 
of demand. 
(e) Stability and Reliability.
The issue of stability and reliability of supply from the power electronics point 
of view can be improved in an embedded generation scheme as opposed to 
the supply of electricity over long distance. This is attained through shorter 
response time and better controls over the embedded systems. 
(f) Supply and Demand Matching.The ability to design the supply to match the demand as in an embedded 
generation scheme, again, would reduce unnecessary wastage as the 
demand profile is better defined for a smaller load than it is for supplying a 
whole region or country via the grid. 
5. Embedded generation offers an excellent option for the transmission of energy at 
the local level and coupled with the growing interest/research in renewable 
energy within the build environment, it would make a good combination in the 
way energy is generated and transmitted in the future.10 ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CONSERVATION
10.1 BACKGROUND
1. Energy efficiency and conservation refers to measures aimed at reducing 
energy consumption without sacrificing productivity or increasing costs. 
Energy efficiency and conservation measures have the potential to scale 
down capital investments needed to provide additional supplies and reduce 
overall resource use. It also has the potential of reducing cost of production 
at the end user level. 
2. Energy efficiency and conservation reduces energy demand, improves 
energy security, improves competitiveness and helps to mitigate climate 
change by lowering GHG emissions.
3. A number of factors have highlighted the importance of, and urgency for, 
energy efficiency and conservation: 
(a) High energy prices – the continuing increase in the price of energy has 
significantly contributed to increased interest in energy efficiency and 
conservation.
(b) Insecurity of supply – expressed in the growing discomfort about the 
vulnerability and uncertainty of future energy supplies as well as the 
volatility of their prices. 
(c) Adverse environmental and health impacts – there is increasing concern 
about spiralling degradation of the environment as exemplified by 
increased local air pollution and acid precipitation from ever growing 
fossil fuel combustion. Associated with this are global issues such as 
climate change as a result of GHG emissions. 
(d) Depletion of energy resources – there is growing unease at the rate of 
depletion of major energy resources. The most used energy resources 
such as fuel wood and fossil fuels are becoming scarce as demand rises. 
4. From the consumer’s point of view, energy efficiency and conservation 
measures yield direct savings on the energy bill. From the national stand 
point, adoption of such measures would significantly reduce the foreign 
exchange costs of oil imports. It would also serve to defer additional 
investment in power generation capacity. Ultimately, improved energy 
efficiency would boost the competitiveness of Papua New Guinean products 
owing to reduced input costs. 10.2 CHALLENGES
1. Inadequate awareness of the potential benefits from efficient use and 
utilization of energy efficiency and conservation practices, technology and 
appliances. 
2. Consumer apathy. There is a tendency for consumers not to embrace energy 
efficiency and conservation best practices as long as there is good supply of 
energy for current use. 
3. Limited use of available conservation tools / new technology with increased 
efficiency leads to energy wastage.
4. High technical losses in the generation, transmission and distribution systems.
5. Limited technical capacity, training and expertise in energy management and 
conservation. 
6. Lack of comprehensive, reliable energy audit data and information covering 
various sectors and sub-sectors. 
7. Slow adoption of conservation opportunities and measures due to socioeconomic factors.
8. Inadequate financing owing to challenges in sourcing funds and credit 
mobilization for energy efficiency and conservation projects are impediments 
to investment in this area.
9. Insufficient standardized equipment and appliances that would benefit from 
tax rebates and fiscal incentives.
10.Low awareness of existing fiscal, legal, regulatory incentives, frameworks and 
mechanisms such as tax holidays, generation plant and equipment tax 
rebates, emerging credit facilities such as green energy facility grants and 
loans and carbon credit from the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).
11.High cost of optimisation technologies in energy development and 
consumption. 10.3 STRATEGIES– ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CONSERVATION
1. The Government shall do necessary amendments to legislations governing 
fuel use, environment, and transport and building to regulate energy use and 
vests it in the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA).
2. The Government shall formulate an EECA Policy as a matter of urgency and 
align it with this Energy Policy.
3. The Government to setup an Energy Efficiency and Conservation EECA
Program.
4. Recognize energy efficiency and conservation as a high-priority energy 
resource. 
5. Promote energy efficiency and conservation initiatives in all sectors including 
schools. 
6. Enhance the provision of energy audits and advisory services in the 
provinces.
7. Promote the establishment of laboratories for energy efficiency testing.
8. Disseminate information on energy efficiency and conservation to consumers. 
9. Provide for incentives and penalties to reduce high losses in generation, 
transmission and distribution systems.
10. Provide appropriate fiscal and other incentives to enhance uptake of energy 
optimisation technologies.
11. Review energy intensity in all sectors and international best practices so as to 
enable process improvement.
12. Broaden the scope of energy efficiency and conservation efforts by 
government agencies responsible for environment and energy matters.
13. Introduce the concept of green design in buildings. This includes solar water 
heating, natural lighting, ventilation, and open office design among others.14. Promote development of standards and codes of practice on energy efficiency 
and conservation.
15. Develop and enforce standards for fuel economy through speed limits, 
efficiency of motor vehicle engines as well as adopting good driving and 
maintenance practices.
16. Promote mass transportation of passengers and cargo so as to encourage 
economies of scale and the attendant fuel efficiency.
17. Promote the introduction of new and efficient technologies such as hybrid 
engines, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), fuel 
cell and electric vehicles through demonstration, research and training. 
18. Prepare a National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Plan in consultation 
with relevant stakeholders.
19. Promote efficiency in oil refining in line with modern practices which minimize 
wastage and encourage heat recovery.
20. Promote efficiency and improvement in conservation, generation, 
transmission distribution and consumption of energy including incentives to 
encourage assembly and manufacture of energy efficient equipment.
21. Promote research and development in the field of energy efficiency and 
conservation.
22. Support preparation of education curriculum on efficient use of energy and its 
conservation for education institutions and coordinate with them for inclusion 
of such curriculum in the syllabus.
23. Implement international co-operation programmes relating to efficient use of 
energy and its conservation.
24. Provide financial incentives for any investment made to replace or additional 
capital investment to improve energy efficiency.11 LAND, ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH AND SAFETY
11.1 BACKGROUND
1. Land is a critical resource in the development of energy infrastructure. 
However, due to competing interest in land utilization, the sector faces 
challenges in developing its infrastructure. 
2. Environmental Management in the energy sector is key to ensuring 
sustainability in the energy chain. Energy production, transportation and use 
pose various dangers to human life and the environment. The challenge for 
players in energy sector is the provision of affordable, competitive, reliable 
and sustainable energy whilst upholding people’s rights to land, environment, 
health and safety. 
3. The Environmental Act 2000 (EA 2000) is the umbrella legal framework in 
respect to environmental management in Papua New Guinea. Its 
implementing agency is the – Conservation and Environmental Protection 
Authority (CEPA). It recognizes a “Lead Agency” as any Government 
institution in which any law vests functions of control or management of any 
element of the environment or natural resource. Lead Agencies therefore 
play an important role in enforcing compliance with laws and regulations. 
4. Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations require that mitigating 
measures be put in place to minimize the adverse impact of energy projects. 
Comprehensive environmental impact assessments are conducted for all 
projects prior to their implementation to ascertain the level of potential 
environmental damage, the required mitigation measures and associated 
costs.
5. Other authorities that have regulatory mandate in the energy sector in terms 
of environment, health and safety under the auspices of the Occupational 
Health and Safety Services (OHSS) under the National Health Administration 
Act 1997, Public Health Act 1973 and thus the Industrial Safety, Health and 
Welfare Regulation of 1965, and the Water PNG Limited respectively under 
the Water Resource Act of 1982, National Water Supply & Sewerage Act 
1986 and the National Maritime Safety Authority (NMSA) under the Merchant 
Shipping Act 1975 and Merchant Shipping (Safety) Regulations of 1975. 
6. Vision 2050 acknowledges that land is a vital factor of production in the 
economy together with its aesthetic, cultural and traditional values. Some key initiatives envisioned to address environmental problems which relate to the 
energy sector are: 
(a) Sustainable management of natural resources.
(b) Pollution and waste management. 
(c) Disaster risk management.
(d) Use of incentives for environmental compliance. 
7. The National Constitution of Papua New Guinea under Section 53 offers 
protection of right to property in which citizens are protected from unjust 
deprivation of their properties. Energy sector players, to whom land access 
and utilization is critical in their operations, must be alive to this fact. In 
addition, Section 61 provides basic rights and freedom whereby every person 
have a right to a clean and healthy environment, thus the Constitution also 
declares that sustainable development among the values and principles of 
governance which bind all State organs, officials and any person 
implementing public policy. 
8. The trans-boundary impact of environmental pollutants has necessitated 
international cooperation in order to prevent, minimize and mitigate pollution. 
A substantial portion of the risks arise from operations in the energy sector, 
amongst them transportation of petroleum products, disposal of hazardous 
waste, handling and management of radioactive materials. Several 
multilateral environmental agreements/treaties have been developed globally 
with Papua New Guinea ratifying and domesticating a number of them. The 
Constitution provides that any treaty or convention ratified by Papua New 
Guinea forms part of the laws of Papua New Guinea. It is necessary to 
develop guidelines to ensure the application and compliance of the relevant 
conventions in the energy sector. 
11.2 ENERGY SUPPLY SIDE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS
11.2.1 FOSSIL FUELS
11.2.1.1 EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
1. Exploration and production activities can have negative environmental 
impacts and therefore should be conducted in a way that protects the 
environment. Offshore and onshore exploration effects can be minimized by 
limiting the exploration duration and activities as well as employing newer 
technologies. 11.2.1.2 PETROLEUM
1. Major environment, health and safety concerns in the petroleum industry are 
fire outbreaks and oil spills. In other countries, incidences has occurred, 
which a number of incidents involving petroleum products has led to loss of 
life and property. However, Papua New Guinea can such accidents 
addressed through adoption of international best practices in handling safety 
concerns in the sub-sector and ensuring strict compliance and enforcement of 
the regulations. 
2. Personnel handling petroleum products are exposed to the risks associated 
with inhalation of product fumes and dermal contact. These concerns can be 
addressed through use of high standard equipment and repeated use of 
personal protective equipment. 
11.2.1.3 COAL
1. Concerns in the coal industry as experienced by coal-producing countries 
include emissions which contribute to global warming and acid rain. However, 
if Papua New Guinea harness and develop it, modern technologies, such as, 
among them the Clean Coal Technology (CCT) can be applied to reduce 
pollution significantly. 
2. Clean coal energy can be harnessed chemically without combustion with air 
by capturing 99% of Carbon Dioxide (CO2).
11.2.1.4 RENEWABLE ENERGY
1. Generally, renewable energy is considered as an environmentally friendly 
option for energy development. However, some concerns exist raising the 
need for mitigation measures to be incorporated in projects to ensure minimal 
impact and also ensure sustainability.
11.2.1.5 GEOTHERMAL
1. Geothermal power generation involves drawing fluids at high temperature 
from deep in the earth. These fluids carry a mixture of gases which contribute 
to global warming, acid rain, and noxious smells if released. 2. To mitigate these, the plants are equipped with emission control systems to 
reduce the exhaust. In addition, the practice of re-injecting these fluids into 
the earth in order to stimulate production helps to reduce the environmental 
risk. Other mitigation measures include extraction of excess materials for 
industrial use. 
11.2.1.6 LARGE HYDRO
1. The major concern for hydros is the displacement of people and wildlife where 
a reservoir is located. Large reservoirs result in submersion of extensive 
areas upstream, destroying ecologically rich and productive land, riverine 
valley forests, marshlands and grasslands.
2. Dams also have an impact on aquatic ecosystems both upstream and 
downstream by disrupting the reproductive cycle, e.g., fish whose spawning 
grounds are normally upstream. Submerged vegetation - decomposes 
anaerobically producing methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Other risks of 
hydros include dam failure which may be caused by sabotage, or structural 
failures, and siltation. Appropriate mitigation measures should be adopted to 
counter these and other potential negative effects. 
11.2.1.7 BIOMASS
1. A supply-demand imbalance in the use of biomass has negative 
environmental impact in the form of deforestation such as those experienced 
by other biomass-producing countries. It has been established that charcoal 
production leads to the depletion of woodlands at the rate of 0.5 hectare per 
annum, however, Papua New Guinea will adopt appropriate mechanism to 
avoid such imbalance occurring when its biomass industry fully integrates and 
is in operation. This is mainly because of the inefficient charcoal kilns used. 
In addition, the cost of the raw material (e.g. tree replacement) is generally not 
considered and the wood is regarded as a free good. 
11.2.1.8 ELECTRICITY
1. The construction and operation of electricity projects have a direct impact on 
the quality of the environment either by the emission or discharge of 
pollutants, poor waste handling, or by changing the ecological systems. The 
degree of pollution and other ecological impacts are dependent upon the 
nature of the technology in use as well as the size and the general location of 
the plant. 2. A health and safety concern with electricity grid systems and consumer 
installations is the danger of electrocution and electric shocks. 
11.2.1.9 NUCLEAR ENERGY
1. The global, traditional challenge of nuclear energy remains the management 
of radioactive waste. However, as a result of continued research in the area, 
radioactive waste management is now well within manageable levels. Spent 
fuel rods can either be safely stored until the radioactive levels reduce to nontoxic levels or be reprocessed and reused in generation of nuclear energy. 
The waste also requires special handling and storage facilities to reduce the 
risk of exposure to employees, the public and the environment.
2. A nuclear meltdown may cause release of radioactive materials which can 
have a negative impact to environment, health and safety of persons. 
However, further research has led to development of advanced reactors with 
enhanced security and safety mechanisms that greatly diminish the possibility 
of a nuclear accident. 
11.3 DEMAND SIDE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS
1. Solid fuels or biomass fuels are less efficient than oil, natural gas or propane. 
It takes larger quantities of peat, wood, or coal to do the job and they will 
produce larger quantities of smoke when they are burned. Solid fuels 
produce less heat for the amount of fuel consumed and produce more 
pollution. This is described as the energy ladder. 
2. The solid fuels lead to increased indoor air pollution which leads to Upper 
Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI). The challenge is to move consumers up 
the energy ladder recognizing that biomass, which is at the bottom of energy 
ladder provides 60% of cooking energy needs in Papua New Guinea. 
3. Kerosene is widely used in households for lighting and cooking, mainly by 
rural masses in Papua New Guinea. In 2008 about 300 thousand cubic 
metres were used, up from 200 thousand cubic metres consumed in 2003 
according to the UN Human Development Indictor. However, this causes 
indoor air pollution leading to cases of URTI, in addition to the risk of 
explosions of lamps and stoves leading to injuries, loss of lives and property. There is need to move consumers from the consumption of kerosene to LPG 
and natural gas. 
11.4 CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES
1. Papua New Guinea is a signatory of the Kyoto Protocol, a treaty signed in 
1997, to lower anthropogenic emissions of Carbon Dioxide (CO2). However, 
Papua New Guinea is not among the Annex I countries, which have emission 
reduction targets since its emissions are low - compared to emissions from 
developed (Annex I) countries and MDCs and LDCs. However, under the 
protocol, there are opportunities to benefit by selling Certified Emission 
Reductions (CERs) through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). 
Papua New Guinea has developed a National Strategy on Climate Change. 
2. Although Papua New Guinea has ratified the Kyoto Protocol, it has not 
benefited much from the CDM since potential projects may have not been 
approved, developed or fully made operational, though, the projects proposals 
may have been submitted for consideration under CDM. 
3. With such results of whether, there are investments and or not being 
proposed, approved and developed, on a scale of between 100 points 
(highest) and 0 points (lowest) Papua New Guinea is rated to have an 
‘inadequate’ climate for CDM investment. It however needs to move from 
‘Satisfactory’ to ‘Good’ categories to improve opportunities to attract 
investments.
11.5 DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND MITIGATION
1. Natural disasters may be triggered by adverse weather and climate 
conditions, whereas manmade disasters may be due to sabotage, human 
error or technological failure. Government therefore recognizes the need to 
establish appropriate disaster preparedness and mitigation mechanism within 
the energy sector. 
2. The following hazards are a constant threat that must be taken into 
consideration in planning and management of the energy sector: 
(a) Climate and weather hazards including floods and droughts. 
(b) Geophysical hazards including earthquakes, faults, volcanic eruptions, 
subsidence, landslides, blowouts and mud flows. 
(c) Environmental hazards including soil erosion, siltation and 
desertification. (d) Industrial accidents, oil spills, human negligence, sabotage can occur 
through terrorism and other deliberate acts and infrastructural systems 
failure. 
3. The challenges are mainly in setting up and making operational capacity for 
disaster preparedness, management and mitigation. However, this can be 
addressed through proper disaster preparedness and management 
mechanisms and practices. 
11.6 LAND AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS
11.6.1 BACKGROUND
1. Energy development projects have various impacts on communities where the 
projects are implemented. Key among these is both economic and physical 
displacement. Physical displacement of project affected people is particularly 
prevalent in projects such as hydro power plants requiring water reservoirs, 
acquisition of way leaves during construction of transmission lines and 
pipelines. Others include the concern by local communities that they will not 
benefit from these projects. 
11.6.2 CHALLENGES
1. Absence of a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) Framework: Currently, all 
projects receiving support by World Bank or IFC are required to develop 
RAPs. These should be replicated for all projects and a national framework 
developed. The State shall develop Resettlement Plan Framework for all 
hydro projects that causes shifting and relocation of settlements.
2. Access to and acquisition of land: Difficulty in the acquisition of sites, way 
leaves, rights of way and easements to facilitate energy infrastructure 
development is an impediment to fast tracking the improvement and 
upgrading of the energy systems. Further, legal and regulatory provisions in 
the energy sector governing land acquisition and access are inadequate. The 
State shall pursue all avenues to secure land through outright purchase or 
long term lease from the landowner for purposes related to the projects 
including right of way and establishment of infrastructures of the hydro 
projects.3. Absence of a comprehensive and fair compensation mechanism for local 
communities in line with the national constitution. The State shall promote 
equity and benefits sharing with the State, the Developers and the 
landowners.
4. Vandalism of energy sector infrastructure continues to cause immense 
losses as well as supply interruptions. 
5. The need to enhance regional, gender and environmental considerations
in energy planning and development. The State shall promote equal gender 
participation across all age group and the vulnerable communities.
6. Land access and permit where exploration blocks fall on private land or 
cultural heritage areas including game parks and reserves. The developer 
shall take all necessary precaution to minimise collateral damage to 
neighbouring property including all reserves area in the cause of its operation. 
The State shall promote good stewardship and protection of reserved areas 
and exercising environment rehabilitation and restoration measures.
7. The State shall ensure the right way and access thereof, and all natural 
corridor to be kept open at all times.

minimizing damage to humans, infrastructure and the environment. 12 PROPOSED INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
12.1 OVERVIEW
1. Since PNG achieved its Independence in 1975 a coherent National Energy Policy 
was either non-existent or was in a fragmented form. The National Energy Policy 
was eventually has workshopped in March 2006, this followed on from an AusAid 
funded technical assistance ( TA) facility called AusAid Advisory Service Facility 
(ASF) II and was part of the GoPNG ongoing Public Sector Reform in September
2003.
2. Despite several such reviews in the past by various organizations such as 
AusAid, (2006) Secretariat of The Pacific Community (SPC) in 2009, and DPE in 
2006 very little progress occurred. The aim of the National Energy Policy was to 
merge all aspects of energy planning and delivery in a rationale and coordinated 
manner. The long term objective now is to establish an overarching National 
Energy Policy with and Energy Plan in order to deliver the Governments 
aspirations on national development. This will consistent with the MDG, the DSP 
2010 to 2030, and Vision 2050.
3. While the SPC study reviewed the PNGs Energy Security, the ASFII reviewed 
the following objectives:
a. to Evaluate and review current energy policies with the view to identifying 
issues and priorities associated with policy development and 
implementation;
b. to Evaluate Capacity building including the establishment of an overall 
mission statement for the Energy Division in the Department of Petroleum 
and Energy;
c. Assessment of specific short, medium and long-term objectives of Energy 
Division,
d. Develop indicative strategies and draw up a Twenty-year work plan for 
policy review, development and implementation support ; and
e. Review several policy issues relating to midstream and downstream 
petroleum processing of the Energy Division.
4. The Division of Energy had also gone through three (3) decades of transition and 
transformation to what is now the Energy Wing of the Department of Petroleum 
and Energy. It was established in 1992 as Department of Energy Development 
with the following mandate;a. Promote a nation-wide program of rural electrification through 
improvement of existing rural electrification facilities as well as 
implementation of our projects using environmentally sound energy 
conversion technologies.
5. The Department of Energy Development (DED) however, was abolished in 1995 
and transformed into an Office of Energy Development within Department of 
Mining and Petroleum (DMP). When the Department of Petroleum and Energy 
was established after the abolishment of the Department of Mining and 
Petroleum in August 1997, the Office of Energy Development was renamed as 
Division of Energy but retained most of its function of 1992 with additional 
functional responsibilities such as the formulation and implementation of the 
National Energy Policy as well as promotion of non-fossil and renewable energy.
6. Following the National Executive Council (NEC) Decision No. NG 141 of 2011 
endorsement of the Electricity Industry Policy (EIP) these led to the establishment 
of Energy Wing, which was then mandated to undertake the technical regulatory 
functions of the electricity industry in the country. This will require the 
establishment of four (4) Regional office located in Port Moresby (Southern 
Region), Lae (Momase), Mt. Hagen (Highlands Region), and Kokopo (NGI 
Region). This will enable the transfer of the technical regulatory functions of PPL 
to DPE Energy Wing, with consultations from the Independent Consumer 
Competition Commission (ICCC). Furthermore the Energy wing has been 
directed to formulate and implement the National Electrification Rollout Plan 
(NEROP) for the country in an endeavours to meet the 70 percent electrification 
access by households by year 2030 under the Development Strategic Plan (DSP) 
and Vision 2050.
7. Several additional responsibilities of the Energy Wing are as follows :
a. Monitor, review and provide recommendations on fuel pricing, electricity 
tariffs , and Government charges and subsidies, in order to ensure that the 
full and correct prices signals are conveyed to consumers when 
convenient ; and
b. so as to negotiate and Develop and maintain the capacity to monitor and 
evaluate the equivalent landed price of petroleum products, the petroleum 
company costs elements, the pricing formula, and Government charges so 
as to negotiate and maintain equitable pricing and proper contractual 
arrangements for petroleum products.8. These therefore indicate and highlight the fact that the Energy Wing's 
responsibilities covers both midstream to downstream aspects of petroleum 
production, supply and consumption to PNG.
12.2 PROPOSED INSTITUTIONS
1. The institutional arrangements of the energy sector will be streamlined to 
encourage efficiency, access and affordability. The energy regulatory functions 
both technical as well as economic will be brought under the proposed National 
Energy Authority of PNG.
2. Note: NEC Decision 145 of 2013 of 3rd of May directed the abolishment of the 
Department of Petroleum & Energy and creation of the Petroleum & Energy 
Authority not implemented).
3. To meet the challenges and demand, and scope of these functional 
responsibilities involving the hydrocarbon industry and other cross-sectoral areas, 
and energy sectors such as electricity, the Department of Petroleum & Energy 
must be re-structured in order to build institutional capacity to manage the 
midstream to downstream activities of the Petroleum sector, as part of the overall 
Natural Energy Policy and Rural Electrification.
4. The Department of Petroleum and Energy will be restructured into the following 
entities:
a. National Energy Authority of PNG (NEA)
b. Petroleum Resources Authority (PRA).
c. Energy Regulatory Commission (ENERCOM).
5. The structure of these institutions are provided as an attachment.12.3 FUNCTIONS
Institutions Core functions
1. National Energy 
Authority (NEA)
Mandate:
To regulate and promote the development, dissemination of information, 
regulation and licensing, relating to all forms of energy, including 
renewable energy sources; and to do all things necessary and desirable 
for the achievement of its objectives and functions.
Purpose:
NEA will be the over-arching body responsible for all energy related 
matters, so far as it involves the development, conversion and 
transportation of energy for direct uses, and for further downstream 
processing of the resources. It will also be responsible for encouraging 
the development of all renewal resources for conversion into consumer
