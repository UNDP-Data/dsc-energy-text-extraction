Although self-sufficient for about 80% of its energy needs filled by domestic biomass fuel and some
hydro-electrical sources, Haiti faces a severe energy crisis. This crisis is characterized by numerous
factors, including: (1) the burden to the economy of the importation of petroleum products for fuel, 
(2) a very low per capita consumption and high energy intensity (energy consumption per GDP), 
(3) the insufficient development of the manufacture industry sector (19% of total energy consumption) 
and predominance of the residential sector (65% of consumption), (4) excessive biomass use leading to 
high levels of deforestation and land degradation, (5) increasing population growth at about 2.02% per
year and (6) decreasing growth of the GDP per capita at about 2.6 % per year. 
Most fuel wood and charcoal (80%) is used in the household sector, mainly for cooking. The
efficiency of stoves (mainly open) is very low (around 22% for traditional stoves and 30% for 
improved charcoal stoves). The intensive use of the fuel wood for cooking and production of charcoal, 
without systematic regeneration, causes further deforestation of the country. 
To offer the decision makers and various stakeholders a tool to improve this situation, a National 
Development Plan of the Energy Sector of Haiti is elaborated, with the support of the International 
Agency for Atomic Energy (IAEA), covering the period 2007-2032. This Plan has the following 
objectives: 
The objectives of the Haitian Government related to the energy sector are as follows: 
− Support the recapitalization of enterprises in difficulty (case of EDH1); 
− Improve and modernize the management of public enterprises in key sectors, including EDH; 
− Improve the production and distribution of electricity in the country; 
− Strengthen the State’s regulatory role in key sectors of the economy, including energy; 
− Prepare and implement the reforms needed to create a favorable environment for local and 
foreign investment; 
− Put a priority on a significant improvement in the provision of electricity in the country; 
− Promote alternatives to fuel wood and promote renewable energies including energetic crops 
and forests. 
As far as the electricity sub-sector is concerned, the Government of Haiti has established the following 
priority objectives for the public utility EDH: 
− A management contract with clear performance targets for the company. 
− Maintaining electrical service for at least 12 hours per day in Port-au-Prince and in the rest of 
the country; 
− Increase the billing rate from 47% to 75% in the next 15 years and increase the commercial 
profitability of the company; 
− Stabilization of EDH and establishment of conditions necessary for its recovery; 
− Improvement of the quality of the provided electricity and customer service; 
− Reduction of technical losses and increase of efficiency; 
− Reduction of fraud and theft of electricity; 
− Obtaining better conditions in the PPA2 contracts with private producers, taking into account 
the interests of both parties. considered, as well as implementation of a medium-term investment plan designed to increase 
access to electricity of the population from 12.5% in present to 20% by 2013. 
A critical issue, both in terms of energy and of environmental integrity is the conservation of natural
resources, especially forests through several measures: 
− Support for more efficient use of charcoal and fuel wood; 
− Reforestation of strategic areas for the safety of the population, environmental protection and 
tourism;
− Generation of energetic forests and crops; 
− Conversion to diesel, bio-diesel and to LPG of 1,000 small enterprises that use wood as fuel; 
− Financial support to cellulose briquette producers; 
− Initiation of a study to determine the feasibility of wood imports or exchanges with lime; 
− Promotion of renewable energies (wind and solar) through institutional reinforcement (and 
improved access for the poor to energy services).
Promotion of bio-fuels through incentives for growing energetic crops and by encouraging investments 
in facilities for bio-fuels production and use. Main bio-fuels are bio-diesel, ethanol and methanol 
produced from bagasse and different fast growing plants. 
Energy sector reform is also a key concern. The reform of the energy sector today should be guided by 
the idea of finding the most suitable form of partnership between public needs and private interests. 
There is a need for state intervention through the reform of the energy sector, institutional and legal 
framework, new institutions and new and immediate measures. 
In conclusion, the present National Energy Development Plan aims to provide policy makers with 
quantitative and qualitative information on the Haitian energy sector, in order to design appropriate
policy and strategies to achieve sustainable goals. It shall serve as a tool to meet the objectives of the 
Government strategy. It is consistent with the provisions of the Interim Cooperation Framework (ICF)
up to the end of year 2006, but analyzes the energy sector more in detail on a longer time horizon, up 
to 2032. It also aims at recommending specific improvement and development measures for this 
sector for short (until end of 2008), medium (2008-2013) and long (2013-2032) terms. Preface 
The present Haiti National Energy Sector Development Plan (NESDP) aims at providing policy 
makers with quantitative and qualitative information on the Haitian energy sector. With this, decision 
makers will be better equipped to design appropriate policy and strategies to achieve sustainable goals. 
This Plan shall serve as a tool to meet the objectives of the Government for all forms of energy and in 
correlation with related issues such as economic and social development. The NESDP is consistent 
with the provisions of the Interim Cooperation Framework (ICF) up to the end of year 2006, but 
analyzes the energy sector more in detail, on a much longer 25-year time horizon, up to 2032. This 
rather extended period of time is selected in conjunction with the proposal, by the present Government, 
to elaborate a long term vision for the sustainable development of Haiti. 
The PNDSE also recommends specific improvement and development measures for the Energy sector 
of Haiti for the following time horizons: short-term actions (until 2008), medium-term actions (2008-
2013), long-term actions (2013-2032). 1 Country overview
1 Haiti is located in the center of the Caribbean region in the Central America, western part of the island of 
Hispaniola, directly neighbour to Dominican Republic. Total area of the country is 27.250 square kilometres 
in a very mountainous morphology. In general, the country has two seasons – wet and dry – where the 
annual weighted average rain accounts for 1300 (from 400 to 3000)3
 millimetres. 
2 The Haitian population increased by 22.7% during the period 1990-2004, from 6.486 to 7.959 million 
inhabitants, leading to an average annual growth rate of 1.56 % over the last fourteen years. Average
population density is about 300 inhabitants per square kilometre while in the western part of the country and
Port-au-Prince, it exceeds more than double. In rural areas, where 60% of population lives, two third of the 
workforce is involved in agricultural production. There is considerable additional pressure on the urban 
areas: the urban population has more than tripled from 1982 to 2003 going from 1.04 million to 3.2 million 
inhabitants. Overall, the population’s vulnerability is very high: 65% live under the poverty threshold. The 
principal health indicators are very alarming – infant and maternal mortality rates remain very high, half of 
the population does not have access to clean drinking water and only 28% have access to decent sanitation 
facilities. In terms of active population, the country has sufficient potential labour force as the population of 
the country is relatively young - 50% of population is less than 20 years old. 
3 With an annual per capita GDP of US$ 488.6 in 2005 (from US$ 635 in 1986-1988, US$ 510 in 1996 and
US$444 in 2000), Haiti is the only country on the continent that appears on the list of least-developed
countries. Over the past decades, Haiti experienced consequent decline of real per capita GDP with negative 
average annual growth rates of 2.4% in the 1980s and 2.6% in the 1990s, respectively. Such economic
performance was particularly affected by the mismanagement of market liberalization of the 1980s, the
military coup of 1991 and the (subsequent) international embargo of the beginning of 1990s, and finally the 
political crisis that lasts until the elections in 2006. Economic situation in the country is still fragile due to 
continuing socio-political fluctuation, which adversely effects the rehabilitation and maintenance of 
economic, social and institutional infrastructure. As the results, the country faces at present, considerable 
decrease of export revenues from industrial goods, increase of unemployment rates and weakening of tax 
collection and in turn, the control of public expenditures. Imports are three times higher than exports,
counting in 2005 for roughly US$ 1,200 million. Any measures to increase imports for energy purposes 
should be taken with extreme caution due to low revenues of the population and therefore incapacity to
afford.
4 In terms of distribution of GDP by economic activities, service sector accounts 45% share to the total GDP 
(including 2% of energy) followed by agriculture and mining and construction with 24% and 21%, 
respectively. Industrial sector appears to represent only 10%. Over the past decades, the distribution of GDP
had remained as such due to the limited technology available and the low level of capitalization, in addition 
to the weak socio-political environment.
5 Per capita annual final electricity consumption is only 84 kWh in 2000 the least amount in the Caribbean
area, as only 12.5% of the population is regularly connected to the grid. 
2 Present status of the Haitian energy sector 
2.1 Present final energy consumption by energy form and by sector 
6 The total final energy consumption for year 2000 was 1,687 thousand toe. Fuel wood and charcoal with
1,262 thousand toe had the biggest share (75%), followed by motor fuels and fossil fuels, accounting 258 
thousand toe (15%) and 89 thousand toe (5%), respectively. Electricity accounted 66 thousand toe (4%) and 
feedstock 12 thousand toe (1%). sector 203 thousand toe (12%), households 1,094 thousand toe (65%) and services 62 thousand toe (4%). 
8 Haiti has a very low final energy consumption per capita, amounting 209 kgoe/capita in year 2001, as
compared to other countries in Latin America and Caribbean [1]: Bolivia 306, Nicaragua 403, Honduras 
445, El Salvador 473, Ecuador 542, Guatemala 570, Dominican R. 626, Costa Rica 639, Panama 653, Cuba
806, Jamaica 876, Mexico 945, Venezuela 1501. (see Appendix 1) 
9 The final energy intensity, final energy consumption per GDP, shows approximately 570 kgoe/1000
US$1995 in 2001, or the equivalent of 22.8 kgoe/1000Gdes. Compared to other countries in Latin America 
and Caribbean [1]: Jamaica 431, Cuba 403, Guatemala 361, Dominica R. 306, El Salvador 264, Mexico
195, Panama 195, Costa Rica 167, it shows a very inefficient use of energy in Haiti. (see Appendix 2). 
10 The main part of fuel wood and charcoal (80%) is used in household sector mainly for cooking. The
efficiency of stoves (mainly open) is very low (around 22% for traditional stoves and 30% for improved
charcoal stoves). The intensive use of the fuel wood for cooking and production of charcoal causes further
deforestation of the country. 
11 Electricity consumption represents only 4% of the total final energy. Less than 30% of the households are
connected (including illegal connections) to the grid and only 12.5% are regularly connected with meters.
The largest sector for electricity consumption is industry (43%). But this sector represents only 10% of the 
GDP. 
12 More than half (59%) of the motor fuels are used for passenger transportation. The car ownership is 
relatively low (about 1 car for every 100 persons) as compared to other countries in Latin America and the 
Caribbean) in year 1994: Colombia 45.3, Brazil 19.0, Venezuela 13.4, Mexico 11.0 and Argentina 7.7. The 
average distance travelled by car is about 5500 km per car yearly. 
2.2 Present status of energy supply subsectors 
Fuel wood and charcoal, deforestation
13 As stated in paragraph 6 the most important sources of energy in Haiti are fuel wood and charcoal, which 
account for 75% of the final energy consumption by all sectors in the year 2000. Charcoal is used by 90% of
the households from Port-au-Prince and other major cities, and the charcoal chain from production to final 
consumption employs more than 150 thousand persons. Charcoal is made from trees, with a low conversion
efficiency of about only 20% (5 kg of wood for 1 kg of charcoal). In terms of heat content, the conversion
factor may be higher (60% for high moisture content wood and 40% for average moisture content wood). 
(see Appendix 3). 
14 In the year 1982, available wood stock was estimated to 37.4 millions of cubic meters4 while about 6 
millions of cubic meters were used for different purposes, including wood in construction/building sector 
where metallic pools should be used instead. Such consumption is equivalent to approximately 30 millions 
of trees annually harvested. At the same time it was estimated that only 20 millions of trees were planted but 
the survival rate is not given. However, the World Bank has indicated in 19915 a survival rate of about 40%,
which implies that over the 20.000 trees planted only 8.000 are saved. The yearly reforestation capacity is
then estimated at about 26% of the consumption, which is equivalent to 1.6 millions of cubic meters.
However, the annual capacity of self-reproduction of natural wood without new plantations was also 
evaluated to 1.6 millions of cubic meters, i.e. roughly 26 % of the total wood used annually. If those figures 
are reliable, the country is left today with less than half of his wood stock of 1982 that is to say 18.6 
millions of cubic meters, and if such trends were to be continued without any corrective actions, it is not 
pessimistic to forecast complete depletion of that resource in a very near future. 15 Haiti has no domestic production of crude oil and refining capacities. Therefore, all needed petroleum 
products are imported. The petroleum products subsector, which represents only 20-25% of the national
energy supply, uses more than 35-50% of external receipts of the country. Consequently, it limits the local
multiplier effects in economic development through insufficient domestic investment in other economic 
activities. Between 15 to 25% of these products are used for electricity generation. Moreover, some small
distributors are mixing diesel and gasoline with kerosene to take advantage of the comparative low cost of 
this product. 
16 Haiti is importing its petroleum products from Venezuela, via its refinery based in Curacao, from Trinidad 
and Tobago (LPG) and sometimes from Panama on a market price basis. Recent years prices increases in oil 
and oil products put a higher pressure on the import / export commercial balance of the country. 
17 During a very short period in the past the country benefited from the preferential terms of the San Jose 
Accord according to which Mexico and Venezuela supply a total of 160,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude 
oil (half of the total each) to 11 Central American and Caribbean nations (Barbados, Belize, Costa Rica, the 
Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Nicaragua and Panama) at 
discount prices. The accord came into existence on August 3, 1980 (after the second oil price shock) and it 
has been renewed on August 3, 2004. The pact also establishes “a cooperation mechanism to promote the 
economic and social development of the beneficiary nations”. The cooperation accord finances socialeconomic development projects in the participating nations, as well as trade of goods and services by
Mexican and Venezuelan firms. The countries may also recoup up to 20% of expenditures under the Pact in
the form of low interest long-term loans for development projects. If development projects are not achieved,
then the 20% deferred payment is to be settled within five years. Haiti is not currently benefiting from San
Jose Accord due to some unpaid balance in the past. 
18 The Caracas Energy Accord is an extension of the San Jose Accord and now it co-exists with that accord. It 
has been in effect since October 2000, after President Chavez and the leaders of the beneficiary countries, 
including Haiti, signed separate bilateral agreements. It does not involve Mexico, while Cuba is included in
the list of twelve beneficiaries, next to Barbados, Belize, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, 
Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Nicaragua and Panama. The accord provides even “softer” conditions 
than San Jose pact. The Agreement is to be exclusively enforced by the public entities supported by 
Venezuela and the beneficiary country. However, each country may designate private companies to handle 
the logistics of transporting the imported volumes of hydrocarbons. The Caracas Accord is currently under 
full implementation by the Ministry of finance. The accord states that saved money due to the concessionary 
terms of the accord is dedicated to energy project implementation. 
19 The Petro Caribe Accord also with Venezuela was signed in May 2006. According to this accord a credit 
will be granted to the State of Haiti for purchasing petroleum products. 
20 A total of 4 different institutions are presently managing the petroleum products subsector: Ministry of
Commerce through his Bureau of Petroleum Procurement, the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the
Central Bank and the Importer/supplier companies, among them Total/ELF, Texaco, Esso and, Le National
(DINASA) which recently took over from SHELL. 
21 A very dynamic new commercial company called ECOGAZ is currently operating in the LPG market and 
related stoves sales not only in the metropolitan region but also in the north, central and south parts of the
country. Together with TOTAL/ELF, ECOGAZ is selling LPG in very small amounts through small
refilling facilities to ease LPG penetration in less fortunate areas and even in suburban or rural areas. 
22 Total petroleum product storage capacity is 1,688,451 barrels (bbl). Of this total storage capacity, diesel
accounts for 852,405 bbl, gasoline for 369,000 bbl, fuel oil for 178,095 bbl, kerosene for 139,200 bbl and
LPG for 23,271 bbl. Comparing this storage capacity to the total annual consumption of petroleum products, 
including the fuel consumption of power plants, it seems to be currently (2000-2005) sufficient for 5-6 
months of petroleum product consumption (see Appendix 4). In terms of storage capacity it is quite 
sufficient but it is important to know how much of this capacity holds all the time a strategic reserve of 23 LPG is one of the sources of energy used by the household sector and which represents 1.5% of the energy
balance, with one ton of LPG being the useful energy equivalent of 4.7 tons of charcoal. On this basis, it
would require 60,000 tons of LPG to replace the total demand of charcoal [2]. In a previous study [3], the
highest annual consumption level for the LPG used in households was evaluated to 6480 tons. Based on the 
assumption that an average household uses 1.5 cylinders (1 cylinder = 25 pounds) of LPG per month, this
means that approximately 31,300 households might be entirely reliant on LPG. Also LPG is used by a
number of hotels, restaurants and small enterprises (bakeries, dry cleaners etc.). 
Coal/Lignite
24 Lignite is founded in three different locations in the country: Camp Perrin and Lazile in the south, and 
Maïssade in the central plateau. Camp Perrin lignite is a very small deposit of about less than one million 
tons while Lazile is known only for some outcrops. The best deposit according to today studies is located at
Maïssade. 
25 The Maïssade lignite deposit is located 12 kilometers north-west of Maïssade town (200 kilometers north of 
Port-au–Prince), in the central region of the country, with the following characteristics: 
− Proven amount 8.7 million of tons 
− Average depth 10 to 35 meters 
− Average calorific content 2050 kcal/kg
− Average ash content 40% 
− Average sulphur content 6%
26 An oil drill located at about 5 kilometers north-east of the main deposit, made during oil exploration back in 
the sixties, indicates that at about 300 meters depth there are several lignite layers totalizing 250 meters of 
thickness. Furthermore, the feasibility study of the above main 8.7 million tons deposit has indicated that at
about 1 km south-east and north-west of this main deposit there are two other probably small lignite 
deposits to be linked to the main one by two drills of about 100 feet each in order to complete the evaluation 
of the basin. 
27 Imported coal was mainly used in fuelling a cement plant but since mid-1980’s Haiti has stopped its
imports. 
Domestic oil and coal exploration (institutional aspects)
28 Haiti is investigating the potential oil and coal reserves. Their exploration is the responsibility of the Bureau
of Mines and Energy (BME), which is in charge of negotiating concession contracts with private companies,
supervise their works in accordance with the terms of the contracts and report to the Ministry of Public
Works, Transportation and Communications (MTPTC). 
2.3 Electricity
Electricity generation system
29 According to the law of August 9, 1971, the Electricité d’Haiti (EDH) was established. EDH is an 
autonomous state-owned, vertically integrated enterprise that has the monopoly of the production, 
transmission, distribution and commercialization of electricity throughout the country. EDH is reporting to
the MTPTC that names its Board of Directors. 
30 The Board of Directors is based at Port-au-Prince in Metropolitan region while in each other region the 
utility maintains delegates to manage its assets. The metropolitan region is the most important area, with 
three big power plants (total installed capacity: 171.87 MW: two thermal, Varreux (67.95 MW) and 
Carrefour (49.92 MW), and one hydro, Péligre (54 MW) which is subject to a severe sedimentation since 
long time yet. The other electric regions are: North (10.65 MW), Artibonite (16.10 MW), South (8.25 MW)
d CW(492 MW) d hif Jl (432 MW)Thhdiin hydro power plants. The thermal units are diesel motors using generally diesel oil and rarely heavy fuel 
oil. 
31 Independent Power Producers (IPP) have been operating in the electricity sector in Haiti since 1996. The 
first IPP to sign a contract with EDH, in Cap Haitian, was Interselect SA in 1996. In 1998 a Power 
Purchase Agreement (PPA) was signed in Port au Prince with the company Haytian Tractor / Energy 
International for 20 MW supplied at the Varreux site. Next Asservin signed a contract for a capacity of 20
MW, also at Varreux in 2003. Asservin became Alstom in 2004 and increased its contracted capacity to 30
MW with an additional 20 MW standby capacity. Outside of the capital city, Sogener signed four PPAs in
2002 for a total installed capacity of 24 MW in four regions: Cap Haitien (8 MW), Artibonite (8 MW), 
Petit-Goave (4 MW) and Cayes (4 MW). 
32 The total available capacity is much less than the installed capacity due to serious problems of maintenance,
which lead to frequent scheduled and unscheduled outages. The scheduled overhauls or regular visits cannot
be done on schedule due to lack of spare parts. Consequently, EDH has 172 MW installed capacity in Portau-Prince, however most of the time only 90 MW are available during the rainy season and 45 MW during 
the dry season. Total available capacity is higher because at this capacity it should be added the generation 
capacity of the IPPs. 
33 For the fiscal year 2001-2002, EDH had generated and distributed 469,906.44 MWh at a very high
production and transmission costs. Relatively to the total installed capacity of 216.11 MW, it shows a very
low capacity factor (degree of utilization of installed capacity) of 25%, as compared to other Caribbean 
countries: Dominican R. 37%, Cuba 37%, Saint Lucia 44%, Trinidad and Tobago 46%, Jamaica 51%,
Barbados 54% and Saint Kitts and Nevis 63% and to an average of 44.3% for the entire region. (See 
Appendix 5.)
34 The electricity generation units are supposed to be retired at the end of their lifetime, i.e. after a standard 
number of operating hours. But, because of weak management of scheduled maintenance and also their
inappropriate operation, some installations are deteriorating faster than normally expected and sometimes
they cannot be repaired or replaced. Even though the scheduled maintenance is applied, other unexpected
problems can come up due to bad operation with frequent shortages, unstable network etc. Because of the
financial problems the obsolete units cannot be retired in spite of their low efficiency. 
35 Because of the deficit of production registered in the country since the late seventies, EDH lost year by year 
its capability of investment, and has decided since 1991 to buy energy from private companies to overcome 
this problem. During the fiscal year 2001-2002, EDH bought from private sector 78,319.181 MWh. 
Consequently, the total electricity supply for the period was 548,225.621 MWh.
Electrical networks
36 At present, electricity in Haiti is supplied in four main regions. The largest, Port-au-Prince, is the only one
with an integrated distribution network, and in the South, Artibonite, and North there are isolated 
distribution networks in each region, which are not connected, neither in the region, nor in between regions. 
Peak load in 2005 was estimated at about 161 MW in Port-au-Prince, 7 MW in the South region, 14 MW in 
the Artibonite region and 12 MW in the North region. 
37 Each region has at least one hydro power plant and several thermal power plants connected to a local grid. 
For instance, the Metropolitan Region has a local grid where Carrefour, Varreux and Péligre power plants 
are interconnected. Péligre, located in Plateau Central, is linked to the Dispatching site in Port-au-Prince by 
a 115 kV transmission line of 56 km. Dispatching Centre interconnects the three power plants by a 69 kV
transmission line of 53 km. The grid is completed by a 7.2/12.47 kV distribution line of 900 km and a 
2.4/4.16 kV distribution line of 20 km. The total length of transmission and distribution lines for the 
Metropolitan Region is of about 1029 km. 
38 Because there is no large distance between the power plants and the distribution area in other regions, the
lll f iid diibiliillhllii/kbfcountrywide total length of both transmission and distribution lines is of 1760.50 km. 
39 The rate of countrywide electrification is 12.5 % (legal connexions), with Metropolitan region 5.6%, 
Northern 1.12%, Artibonite 1.32%, Southern 1.06% and Centre-West (Jacmel) 0.9%. 
40 The Metropolitan and the Jacmel grids in South-East region were renovated in 1984-1985. Saint Marc grid 
in Artibonite region was renovated in 1997. In fact, all the grids are very old and need to be rehabilitated. 
41 As the availability rate of the units is low relatively to the demand, the company is forced to limit the 
electricity supply in certain regions or/and to purchase energy from private producers. The electricity supply 
varies in time and from one region to another, depending on the availability of the units, energy purchase 
capability of EDH and the inflow energy of hydroelectric dams: 12-16 hours in Metropolitan region, 20-24 
hours in Northern, Artibonite, Southern and Centre-West regions, and 24 hours in Jacmel in October 2004. 
(see Appendix 6). In 2005, in Port-au-Prince Metropolitan area the electricity supply was 6 to 12 hours 
daily. 
Technical and non-technical electricity losses
42 As the majority of the grids are old and unreliable, and the rate of countrywide electrification is low, the rate 
of losses is very high, and consequently, the rate of billing is very low. (see Appendix 7) 
43 Because of the low reliability of the grids, EDH evaluates the technical losses at 18%. So, from the rate of 
total losses situated between 46.02% and 53.59%, the non-technical losses or losses by illegal connections
vary between 31,02% and 38.59% during the past five years. Although the total losses are also high in other 
developing countries: Nigeria 32%, India 27%, Togo 27%, Kenya 22%, Cameroon 21%, the ratio of unpaid
electricity seems to be nowhere as higher as in Haiti. (see Appendix 8) 
44 Non-technical losses represent financial losses to the utility mainly due to illegal connections and bad
revenue collection. Because of the non-technical losses, the utility is not capable to make the current
maintenance of installations, to buy fuel and thus to start a new production cycle. The lack of electricity
contributes to further increases in non-technical losses and it affects the economic growth, which result in 
lack of revenues for people and in the impossibility to pay the electricity bill and also in lack of revenues for 
the budget of the Government, which is not able to give direct subsidies to very poor. Finding a solution for
a normal electricity production - selling - money collection - new production cycle is one of the most 
important and urgent problems for the utility.
Illegal consumption of electricity in households
45 According to Haitian utility data, the invoiced consumption, which was measured with household meters, 
was 115 GWh in 2002. Under the assumption that 65% of all commercial (non-technical) losses are in 
household sector, 151 GWh would be the illegal consumption in households without meters. Total 
electricity consumption in households was estimated at 266 GWh. About 57% of all consumption of 
electricity in households of Haiti represents non-technical (commercial) losses. 
46 The number of households with meters in 2002 was 158,000, which is 10.6% of total number of households 
in Haiti. Based on the rough estimate that 30% of all households are connected to the grid, the number of 
illegally connected households is 289,000. number number % GWh GWh % KWh/household

The average annual residential consumption is 600 kWh. Households with meters consume in average more,
727 kWh, and average non metered (illegal consumption) is 528 kWh. 
47 The main categories of electricity consumption in households today are refrigerators, lighting and TV-audio.
It is believed that the households illegally consuming electricity use it mostly for lighting, TV-audio and 
around one third of them also for refrigerators.

Total 600 
48 A complete analysis and comments are based on assumed number of households without meters and their
consumption. Consumer registration, billing and collecting system should be improved also to provide more 
reliable data. With such improved data it would be possible to make more accurate estimates of 
consumption in households with and without meters. 
49 Analysis conducted over available information shows the following conclusions: 36% of connected and 
with meter households consume 43% of the total electricity. Those who mainly consume electricity illegally 
are the households without meters, but a part of households with meters also use electricity without proper 
authorization. Out of total electricity consumption by households in 2002, 57% are commercial losses. If we
assume that 10 US cents is the average price of electricity for commercial losses, that means that the value
of commercial losses in households is as large as 15.1 million US$. Unfortunately, for any under-developed 
country (with high unemployment, low purchasing power, and high electricity prices compared to 
purchasing power), illegal use of electricity is very widespread phenomenon in households without meters, 
but partly also in households with meters. Those who duly pay for electricity see that no measure is taken 
against those who do not pay for it, moreover, against those who steal energy, and therefore, it works as a
motive for them to delay their payments. 
50 The program for the stabilization of the situation should start by introducing meters on utility account
(credits, donations) where they do not yet exist. This initiative is affordable for the utility and would give
the best results in the shortest period of time. This will contribute to a substantial reduction of commercial
losses and the residential consumption could slightly decrease. At least one third of households illegally 
connected to grid are capable to pay the electricity consumption. In a short period it is possible to install 
at least 100,000 meters in such households, this measure bringing yearly around 6 million US$ to 
EDH.
51 With adequate laws, regulations and institutions, the illegal electricity consumption could be reduced. 
Possible measures might consist of installment of pre-payment meters for careless clients, considerable
penalties for illegal energy consumption, and the possibility of pursuing in court the non-paying consumers. responsibility for these people, having in mind both needs for energy and social care. Measures to help 
vulnerable customers to pay the consumed electricity will reduce the illegal electricity consumption. 
53 Another option could be the decrease of the consumption by energy efficiency measures as the distribution 
of subsidized energy efficient lamps to poor households connected to grid, and have in this way savings on 
fuel cost of 5 US$ per lamp yearly. On the amount of 200,000 lamps it would represent a saving of 1 
million US$ in electricity bills. 
Hydro potential
54 National hydro potential of Haiti is about 153 MW of which 15% (22.88 MW) are in 27 micro sites ranking 
from 0.1 to 2.57 MW with falls going from 50 to 400 meters. These falls can be taped for providing energy
services in isolated areas where the lack of adequate energy services is an important constraint for local
development. In the remaining potential are included 3 major sites, Artibonite 4C is the most important, 
totalizing about 130 MW. 
Wind energy
55 Based on wind measurements carried out in 2005 and 2006 a general map of the available wind resources 
was established. Detailed maps for specific regions of interest are currently under elaboration. These 
measurements confirm past analyses showing that significant wind potential exist in three parts of Haiti 
(West, North-west and North). 
56 In the western part of the country, where the electricity demand is higher, there is a site located in Plaine du
Cul de Sac, at North East of Port-au-Prince, between two big mountain chains named La Selle and Chaine
des Matheux known as very windy. This “wind corridor” crossing the Lac Azueï has been confirmed and
serious consideration is being made to take advantage of this resource by building a wind farm. 
57 In the north-west, a site with good wind potential is located near the island of La Tortue, in the Canal du 
vent between Haiti and Cuba. In 1978, a wind farm of 150 kW was installed in Port-de-Paix by EDH with 
the support of the German cooperation. Two years later, this plant was shut down due to lack of
technological skill and capacity for maintenance. 
Solar energy
58 Haiti has a good solar energy radiation. According to existing estimates, the average radiation is of about 5 
kWh/m2/day. But there is not enough detailed data on the solar potential. Moreover, technical and logistic 
capabilities to carry out appropriate studies are not in place. 
59 Solar energy is mainly used by individuals to produce electricity and hot water. The total solar installed 
capacity has been evaluated at about 0.7 MW. Most of this capacity (80%) is used for lighting and the rest
(20%) goes to vaccines and seafood conservation, pumping, audiovisual and communication. It is important
to mention that initial investment costs are very high for photovoltaic and thermal equipments. The 
propagation of solar technology in Haiti is restricted also by the following local peculiarities: culinary habits 
preventing the use of solar stoves in household sector, corrosion of the pipeline in the solar water heater, 
lack of maintenance capability, even theft of photovoltaic panels at private and public installations etc. 
60 Solar water heaters are mostly used in hotel, residence and health centres. It is also used in a slap-dash
manner for drying fruits. But as said, culinary habits of the households are also preventing a larger use of
the solar stoves. 
2.4 Municipal solid waste energy
61 The production of urban wastes in metropolitan area (Port-au-Prince) is evaluated at 730,000 tons/year, at 
191,000 tons/year for eight other big agglomerations (Cap Haïtien, Gonaïves, Les Cayes, Saint-Marc, 
VerrettesJérémiePortdePaixLimbé) and at 766000 tons/year in the rural regions and small townsThe (8%), plastics objects (7%), metal (3%), paper and cartoon (3%), tissues (2%) and glasses (2%). Many 
neighbourhoods do not have public trash removal services. Some small private services exist, but they are 
relatively expensive. There is no separation of waste from households, companies, hospitals, and 
construction debris. Then, generally, the gathering is done by hand truck and the removal by truck. The two
important landfill sites are located in Truitier, at about 10 kilometers from Port-au-Prince and in Madeline, 
at Cap-Haïtien. The rate of wastes removal is estimated to be less than 30% in MAPAP. In other cities, they 
are generally dumped in rivers and ends up on the coasts. Those wastes are generally burnt. However, a 
little part is used in some areas to produce compost. 
62 The legal framework is insufficiently clear regarding the roles of those involved in waste management,
particularly concerning MAPAP and it lacks of technical standards, adequate financial instruments,
coordination mechanisms and a true strategy regarding the removal, disposal of waste material and eventual 
energy recovery. For about 5 years, a Research Unit, with the technical support of the Cooperation 
University in Development (CUD) of Belgium, based at the Faculty of Sciences (State University of Haiti) 
carried out some research activities in term of landfill management. 
2.5 Other local energy resources 
63 Bagasse: Due to closure of the sugar cane industry
7
, the bagasse production and consumption decreased in 
Haiti. However, the potential of this local energy resource is still remaining. The quantity of the bagasse 
available each year in the sugar cane mills and guildives (artisanal alcohol plant) is estimated to 140,000 
tons but only 15% are used. The yearly energy potential of the bagasse produced in alcohol industry
(distilleries) in Haiti is between 37 and 56 thousand tons oil equivalent – toe. 
64 Animal waste (manure): Some pilot experiments have been made in the past to use those wastes to produce 
biogas for heating. But the production centres were located in non-appropriate areas. The transportation of 
the raw materials was a handicap for those activities.

4 Future energy needs and supply options 
4.1 Final energy demand forecast by energy form and by sector 
65 The final energy demand forecast is derived from the MAED (Model for Analysis of Energy Demand)
study, which is part of the “Plan Energetique National” of Haiti undertaken by Bureau des Mines et de 
l’Energie (BME), Electricité de Haiti (EDH) and Ministère des Travaux Publics Transports et 
Communications (MTPTC) with the technical support of the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
66 The basic assumptions for the final energy demand forecast are as follows: The expected GDP for year 2000-2005. With the international support, particularly with the ICF (Interim Cooperation Framework),
a better economic situation is expected in the future, reflected by a yearly growth rate of 3% between 
2005-2010 and 4% between 2010-2015. As far as the future economic structure is concerned, the 
Manufacturing subsector of Industry is expected to have the highest growth rate (at least 3.9%) during 
the period 2000-2015. 
67 It is expected to have a slow increase of the population growth rate until 2015 (2% in average for the
period 2005-2015, as compared to 1,96% during the recent past years). Under this assumption, the
expected number of inhabitants in 2015 is assumed to be 10,68 million, that represents an increase of 
26% compared to 2000. At the same time, the number of households is expected to increase more, i.e. 
with 41% in the same period, reaching around 2.0 million in 2015. It is assumed that the purchasing 
power of the population will improve, in turn, more families would be able to connect to the electric 
grid and use the electricity (at least 50% of the households will be connected to the main electric grid by
2017). 
68 It is assumed that more efficient equipment and better technologies will be used in industry, but with
higher penetration of the overall electricity use in this sector. As a result, GDP increase will not imply 
the same rate of energy consumption. 
69 By year 2015, it is expected an improvement in the car ownership to 84 persons per car instead of 100, 
and a steady decline of fuel consumption per 100 kilometres due to replacement of the older cars by
newer ones and to improvements in the road infrastructure. 
70 For year 2015 the total amount of final energy consumption is estimated at 2,04 million toe, which is 
more than 20.7% compared to year 2000. As the increase of the GDP is expected to be of 48% in the 
same period, it means a reduction of the energy intensity at the country level (more efficient use of 
energy for the generation of value added by economic sectors). The structure of final energy
consumption in year 2015 is expected to be as follows: fuel wood and charcoal 50% (75% in 2000), 
motor fuels 20% (15% in 2000), fossil fuels 20% (5% in 2000), electricity 10% (4% in 2000) and
feedstock close to 0% (same as in 2000). It can be noticed that the structure of final energy consumption
changes from 2000 to 2015, with the reduction of the share of non-commercial energy, the increase of 
the share of motor fuels, fossil fuels and electricity and no share of feedstock. 
71 The structure of the final energy demand by sector in year 2015 shows that households are expected to 
consume 1.14 million toe (56%), industry 0.46 million toe (23%), transportation 0.34 million toe (16%), 
services 0.1 million toe (5%). Compared to year 2000, it can be noticed a slight decrease in the share of 
household’s final energy consumption and a slight increase in the share of the other sectors: industry,
transportation and services.
72 Elasticity of final energy, defined as the ratio of average annual growth of final energy demand during
2000-2015 and average annual growth rate of GDP for that same period, is 0.48, which shows an
improvement in the final energy intensity of the country. On the other hand, elasticity of electricity for
the same duration is 2.3, showing a faster increase of electricity penetration in all economic and social 
activities than the GDP growth. 
4.2 Energy supply sector development options 
Fuel wood and charcoal, energy substitution to avoid further deforestation
73 Although the industry and service sectors are not affecting considerably the total consumption over time 
as compared to household sector, it is important to reduce fuel wood and charcoal use in those two 
sectors. Indeed, the share of fuel wood in industry will decrease from 60% in the year 2005 to 44% in 
the year 2015 while in service sector its share will go from 56% in 2005 to approximately 30% in 2015. 
74 Available actions are conservation measures through dissemination of more efficient charcoal stoves in
residential and service sectors or improved boilers or ovens in small industry, and substitution of fuelsector by metallic pools may also be implemented. 
The objectives of ICF concerning the substitution of fuel wood and charcoal with alternative 
energy forms are:

In addition, ICF provided for the reforestation of 2,000 hectares for energy purposes and 
financial support for fuel briquette producers by September 2005 and formulated a National 
Action Plan for Forests by March 2006. 
Significant efforts in terms of investment must be made in order to achieve efficient results. By 
2010, it is urgent that the following programme of actions for reconstructing/rebuilding the
wood stocks needs to be implemented: 
- Starting from 2005, annually 2.5% of the total urban families need to switch to another source of
energy. This implies that by the year 2015, about 25% of those families (509,400) will be 
converted. Adding the number of existing families (13.5%) that are already using another energy 
source, the respective achievement for the previous target year is 38.5%. 
- Beginning 2005, implementation of a conservation programme consisting in the dissemination of
improved stoves to 17% of the families in urban area by the year 2015, that is approximately 166 
thousands of households. (see Appendix 9) 
75 Indeed, the results of this programme will include 36% of the households using either kerosene, LPG or
improved stoves by the year 2015, the rest will be using electricity and wood and some traditional
stoves. Of course, this is a very huge programme but it is urgent to implement it if the target is to
provide enough fuel for cooking to the population in a relative comprehensive and effective manner 
without completely depleting the very small amount of wood stock now available. 
76 The number of stoves to be disseminated by 2015 is respectively 153,000 for kerosene, 357,000 for
LPG and 166,000 for improved stoves. 
77 In addition to this very important substitution and conservation programme, importation of charcoal
must be also implemented and equally effective implementation of laws that prevent improper wood 
harvesting to expect relative conservation and start increasing wood stock by the year 2015. To achieve 
this, charcoal import should start with 117,000 tons in 2006, to reach approximately 700,000 tons in the 
year 2009 and then decreasing significantly to less than 200,000 tons by the year 2015. 
78 If the assumption for the today stock of 18 thousands cubic meters is correct, the above four measures 
are needed. If the estimated stock is higher than assumed here, there will be no need for such amount of
imported charcoal. On the opposite, if the actual estimates are lower, then the wood sector situation is 
worst. changes either in the natural reproduction rate of wood or yearly reforestation activities or energy 
consumption by even less than 10% it implies automatically a huge variation in the available stock. 
Consequently, there is a very urgent need to carry out a more comprehensive and complete study for the 
fuel wood subsector. 
 
80 Yearly cost of the LPG program is about 1.2 million US$, while kerosene is about 0.3 million US$ and 
improved stoves 0.1 million US$. Those costs count with a 50% of subsidies and also include the 
managerial cost of 3 US$ per stove. On the other hand, coal import will cost about 166.5 million US$ 
yearly if a price of US$ 350/ton can be obtained. The price of 350/ton reflects an increment of about 
16% of the current price on the local market. 
81 Substitution of fuel wood by imported energy sources should be considered carefully. The high cost of 
imported fuel might increase the export/import imbalance and deteriorate the economic situation of the 
country. Also the country will be more exposed to external price variations of primary fuels. Other 
measures should be considered first, such as increase use of local resources like renewable energy
sources and production and use of energetic crops and forests. 
82 Some countries in the region like Guyana have lots of wood that can be exchanged for limestone, which
is a very abundant and excellent quality raw material in Haiti. They need limestone for different
purposes like soil amendment, construction, pharmaceutical industry etc. They may have interest in 
such transactions. 
Energetic forests
83 Energetic forests are a good way to supply the need for fuel wood and fight deforestation. They consist
in reforestation by using fast growing species like “Bayahonde” or regenerating species like “Bamboo”. 
In fact, the Bayahonde grows anywhere and can be harvested in three years. Concerning the Bamboo it 
re-grows spontaneously after it is cut. Haiti has a lot of land that can be suitable for energetic forests. 
For example “La Plantation Dauphin” (6000 hectares in one piece of land), “la plantation de Madras”, 
Savane désolée, “La-Pierre region”, near Gonaives, the cap of St. Marc, dry region near Port-au-Prince 
and plain of Cul-de-Sac, west side of the Azuei lac, dry regions of Cotes de Fer, Miragoane and western 
part of Gonave island. The trees will be used to produce fuel wood and charcoal. 
Energetic crops
 
84 Energetic crops might be used as a primary source for bio-fuels. These are fast growing plants, which 
can be harvested once or twice a year. One species of interest is the “Jathropha” plant which grows well
in tropical climates and can be used for production of bio-diesel or used as fuel wood. 
85 The Government should investigate the possibility to promote energetic crops and bio-fuels and 
determine the country’s potential for such products. Main bio-fuels are: 
86 Biodiesel is a renewable fuel that can be manufactured from vegetable oils or recycled vegetable
cooking oil and greases. (see Appendix 10) 
87 Ethanol is an alcohol-based alternative fuel produced from any biological feedstoks that contain 
appreciable amounts of sugar (sugar beets, sugar cane) or materials that can be converted into sugar.
(see Appendix 10) 
88 Methanol is an alcohol fuel made usually from natural gas. It could also be made from landfill gas,
bagasse or wood chips. Methanol is a liquid fuel that can be used in an internal combustion engine or a 
fuel cell. (see Appendix 10) 89 Haiti, without domestic crude oil resources, nor refining capacities, is highly vulnerable to the oil
product disruptions and to the volatility of oil product prices. Several response measures are possible to 
diminish this vulnerability.
90 The Government should continue to take advantage of San Jose and Petro Caribe energy accords. They
offer to the country various opportunities: preferential prices for the imported oil products, security of 
supply and, if necessary, provide low interest long-term loans for development projects. 
91 The total petroleum product storage capacity of roughly 1,688,000 barrels (bbl) is currently (2000-2005)
sufficient for 5-6 months of petroleum product consumption and for 2.7 months in year 2015. In terms 
of storage capacity it is quite sufficient but it is important how much of this capacity holds all the time a 
strategic reserve of petroleum products. As a reference, the net importing member states of the 
European Union have the obligation to hold oil reserves equivalent to more than 90 days of the previous
year’s average daily consumption. Some countries have special laws that regulate the strategic oil 
reserves and special agencies that hold and administrate the reserves (Germany, Spain, Hungary, the
Republic of Korea, Czech Republic, Finland, Ireland etc.). The experience of Germany [5] in solving 
the problem of emergency oil reserves could be useful for any oil importing country. The new 
regulatory body intended to be established in Haiti should study the necessity of including in the future
Energy law(s) of the obligation for petroleum companies to hold permanently emergency reserves for a
specified period in order to decrease the country vulnerability to oil product disruption. 
92 The Government should consider also the implementation of a recycling programme for the used engine
oil around the country, which would reduce the import of this petroleum product and would be also
beneficial from environmental viewpoint. 
93 The Government should encourage a closer integration of Haitian petroleum product sector with that of
the Dominican Republic, to take advantage of economy of scale in some joint imports of petroleum 
products. 
Domestic lignite production
94 The possible uses of the Maïssade lignite deposit are: 
− Feeding a steam power plant of 40 MW running 5,500 hours/year for 17 years or of 30 MW for 25 
years, if proved economically effective in comparison with other plant types, or 
− Cement production (lignite used as raw material and as fuel in cement plant). 
The estimated production cost and necessary investment to exploit this deposit are: 
− Production cost: 8 cents/kWh 
− Total investment cost: US$60 million (1980), including the construction of two bridges that 
will give access to the mine. 
4.3 Electricity
Generation system expansion until 2015
95 The MAED study had predicted that the electricity peak load for the Port au Prince grid would reach 
about 150 MW between 2000 and 2010 and about 165 MW between 2010 and 2015 due to expected 
economic and social development of the country. In fact in 2005 the peak load had reached 161 MW. 
The Artibonite region is expected to be connected to the main transmission grid in 2011-2012, when the 
maximum load will be 30 MW. The Northern region will be interconnected in 2013-2015 with a peak 
load of 37 MW. Because of its low consumption and long distance to the existing transmission grid, the
South region will not be connected to the main transmission grid until 2020. In 2015, this region will
reach the peak load of 26 MW. All load and electrical energy needs of these three regions, in the generation can be considered with larger, slower running diesel units or steam turbines. 
96 In the same period, some existing electricity generation capacities will be retired, as they will reach their 
standard lifetime: about 50 MW during the period 2000-2010 and 45 MW between 2010 and 2015.
Therefore, new electricity generation capacities will be necessary to meet the demand with a 
satisfactory level of reliability of the supply. If some 20% of reserve capacity are considered, then about 
200 MW of new capacity must be installed between 2000-2010 and 240 MW between 2010-2015. The
least cost expansion programme for the Haitian electricity generation system was determined using the 
IAEA’s model WASP (Wien Automatic System Planning). In order to obtain sound expansion cost
evaluations for the period up to 2015, a longer period (up to 2020) was considered for the WASP model 
analysis. (see Appendix 11) 
97 In recent years there have been no substantial investments in generation by the public sector.
The most recent investments made by EDH were 10 MW in the VARREUX power plant 
(1996) and also 10 MW in Carefour power plant (1998). On the other hand, IPPs have been 
operating in the electricity sector in Haiti since 1996. Currently (2006) there are PPA contracts
between EDH and Alstom for a capacity of 30 MW with an additional 20 MW standby 
capacity and with Sogener for a total installed capacity of 24 MW in four regions: Cap Haitien 
(8 MW), Artibonite (8 MW), Petit-Goave (4 MW) and Cayes (4 MW). Therefore, for the
immediate future (2007-2010) the purchase of electricity by EDH from private companies will 
continue to be needed. 
98 To attract private investments in electricity generation and at the same time to protect the end 
users, a proper legislative and regulatory framework should be put in place. Institutional 
improvement is also needed, preferably via an independent regulatory entity . 
99 IFC plan proposed the addition of 2 diesel units of 12 MW at Carrefour power station in 2007, one new
power station of 120 MW (6 x 20 MW) in 2012 and some units out of Port-au-Prince (combined cycle, 
if it is possible). No hydro units are provided in IFC plan, however Haiti has a good hydro potential. 
100Having in mind all above considerations, the following electricity generation system expansion options
have been considered: 
Technology type Fuel Size Construction time Available for 
operation from year: 
Diesel engines Imported heavy fuel 2.5 MW < 1 year 2007
oil 12 MW 1 year 2008
Wind farms - 10 x 1 MW 1 year 2009

Steam power plant Domestic lignite 30 MW 4 years 2013
Hydro power plant
(Artibonite 4C)
- 30 MW 4 years 2015
No other hydro options, beside Artibonite 4C have been considered because the respective technical and
economic data were not available in the detailed format as required by WASP model. The new generation
facilities could be either build by EDH or by private investors or by both. The decision of which plants to 
be build by either party will depend upon analysis of each particular situation. 
101An installation programme for small standard diesel engines (2.5 MW) in isolated regional networks has
been decided exogenously from WASP optimisation according to the increase in electricity demand in thermal engines

The unit size of 2.5 MW or multiples of this size are suitable for the small annual increase in
electricity demand of the respective regions. The localisation by regions (except Port-au-Prince) of
these units, in terms of installed capacity, would be as follows: 
− region Artibonite – 22.5 MW, 
− region South – 20 MW 
− region North – 25 MW 
− region West - 10 MW. 
According to investors’s experience and preferred equipment, the size of the units may vary, but the 
total installed capacity must be fulfilled as in the above table to cover the estimated electricity demand. 
102 All the other expansion options were subject to WASP model optimisation, and the least cost
development programme for the Haitian electricity generation system has been determined based on the
following hypothesis: 
• discount rate of 14%; 
• unserved energy cost of 1US$/kWh; 
• salvage value of assets determined based on linear depreciation method; 
• possibility of electricity purchase by EDH from private companies at a similar cost to that of the 
existing purchase agreement (supply fuel and pay a certain amount for the purchased electricity) which 
results in a total cost of about 100 US$/MWh. 
Optimisation criterion is the minimization of the total discounted cost (investment + fuel + O&M + 
unserved energy – salvage value) of all possible expansion paths for the electricity generation system. 
103 The selected value of the discount rate is consistent with the figures being currently used in similar 
studies undertaken for Haiti, with the current interest rates practiced by the banks for credits in 
relatively high country risk environment as is considered for private investments in Haiti. 
104 In assessing the average cost of unserved energy for WASP calculations, two reference figures were
available: 
− the current marginal electricity supply cost of about 100US$/MWh for the existing electricity
purchase agreement; year 2000 is, according to MAED study, of 0.256 MWh / 1000 US$ (762 GWh / 2970 million US$), 
which is equivalent to about 3,900 US$/MWh. 
The selected value of unserved energy for WASP calculations is of 1 US$/kWh, which is equivalent to 
1000 US$/MWh and represents an intermediate penalty, ten times higher than the current marginal
electricity supply option (100 US$/MWh) and 39 times lower than the equivalent (3,900 US$/MWh) of 
the average final electricity intensity at the country level. (see Appendix 11) 
105 In determining the least cost expansion programme for the Haitian electricity generation system, a
difficult decision has to be taken for the very next years (2007-2009) when some of the considered
system development options: combustion turbines (simple cycle), combustion turbines (combined 
cycle), steam power plant, hydro power plant are not available for operation because their respective
long construction time and other practical reasons. In fact, for the very near future only the following 
electricity supply options are available: installation of small diesel engines (2.5 MW) in some isolated
regional networks and additional purchase of electricity by EDH from private companies, which can be
applied from 2007 and installation of diesel engines (12 MW) and/or wind farms (10x1MW), which 
could be operational by 2009. 
106 After considering of all the above electricity supply options, with their respective constraints, the 
reference least cost programme of electricity generation system expansion and operation determined 
with WASP model is the following:

107 The following comments can be made in relation with the reference least cost programme of electricity 
generation system expansion and operation: 
− the installation programme for the small diesel engines (2.5 MW) in isolated regional networks has
been decided exogenously from WASP optimisation according to the increase in electricity demand of
those regions;
− the WASP optimisation doesn’t confirm the provisions of the ICF plan related to the addition of 2
diesel units of 12 MW at Carrefour power station in 2007, one new power station of 120 MW (6 x 20 
MW) in 2012 and some units out of Port-au-Prince (combined cycle, if it is possible); 
− the diesel engines of 12 MW are not chosen in competition with the electricity purchase in period 
2007-2009 and with installation of combined cycle units, 30 MW, in period 2010-2017 because of
their high overnight pure capital investment cost (950 US$/kW) and of their low efficiency (30-33%); 
− the wind farms of 10 x 1 MW are not selected in competition with the electricity purchase in period
2005-2007 and with installation of combined cycle units, 30 MW, in period 2008-2015 because ofelectricity purchase in year 2007 and with installation of combined cycle units, 30 MW, in period 
2009-2017 because of their lower efficiency (30-35%); 
− the combined cycle units of 30 MW are preferred to all other expansion options, starting with their
first year of availability for operation (2010), because of their higher efficiency (40-55%); this 
technology can have an even higher efficiency but conservative figures have been selected purposely
in this study;
− the size of 30 MW for the combined cycle units is preferred to the other two sizes (60 MW and 120 
MW) for the same technology, in spite of its higher specific investment cost, because of its better fit
to the consumption and the low annual increase of the electricity demand; 
− the lignite-fired steam power plant, 30 MW, is not selected in competition with combined cycle units, 
30 MW, because of its higher overnight pure capital investment cost (2300 US$/kW) and of its lower
efficiency (23-30%); 
− the hydro power plant Artibonite 4C is selected for installation in 2014, and its availability for 
operation the next year(2015).

Note: 1. IDC - Interest during construction 
It should be mentioned that the cost of new capacity construction are not specified for the commissioning
year of the unit but for its construction years, according to the “S-curve” of capital expenditure. 
109 The average cost of the sent out electricity from the power plants, calculated as the ratio of the
“discounted total expansion and operation cost” and “discounted electricity demand” is of 87.9
US$/MWh (8.79 US¢/kWh) if calculated for the period 2007-2017, and 84.7 US$/MWh (8.47 
US¢/kWh) if calculated for the period 2007-2022. The average cost is lower when calculated for the 
period 2007-2022 because between 2016-2020 many existing generating units with low efficiency are 
retired and replaced with combined cycle units with higher efficiency. 
110 The total costs for electricity generation system expansion and operation will represent between 31%its expansion (in this year several combined cycle units, 30 MW, and two diesel units, 2.5 MW, will be
in different construction stages. 
111 The above least cost expansion programme is valid for the following intervals of variation of the main
economic parameters: 
• discount rate: 14-19%; 
• cost of unserved energy: 0.6-1.2 US$/kWh; 
• cost of additional electricity purchases from private companies: inferior or equal to 126 US$/MWh. 
112 For the discount rate of 13%, the hydro power plant Artibonite 4C is advanced by one year, in 2014 
instead of 2015. For the discount rate of 12%, the hydro power plant Artibonite 4C is also advanced in 
2015 but, in addition, one wind farm is included as part of the least cost expansion programme in year 
2007 and some combined cycle units, 30 MW, are postponed for one year, the total number in years
2016 and 2021 remaining the same. For the discount rate of 20%, the hydro power plant Artibonite 4C 
is not selected anymore as part of the least cost expansion programme and, on the other hand, some
combined cycle units, 30 MW, are advanced by one year, 12 units being asked until 2016, instead of 11 
units in the reference expansion programme. 
113 For the cost of unserved energy of 0.5 US$/kWh, only 10 combined cycle units, 30 MW, are selected 
until 2016, instead of 11 units in the reference least cost expansion programme and three wind farms of 
10 MW are selected in years 2007, 2011 and 2014. For the cost of unserved energy of 1.3 US$/kWh,
some combined cycle units, 30 MW, are advanced by one year but the total number of asked units until
2016 remain the same (11 units). 
114 For the cost of additional electricity purchases from private companies equal or superior to 127 
US$/MWh the installation of a wind farm in year 2007 become more attractive than the electricity 
purchase. 
115 The annual amounts of additional electricity purchases by EDH from private companies or from 
Dominican Republic (if possible) are quite large: 166 GWh in 2007 (14.4% of the estimated annual 
electricity demand), 212 GWh in 2008 (17.0%) and 266 GWh in 2007 (19.8%). If they are not available 
at a cost inferior or equal to 126 US$/MWh or they are not entirely available, than the only possible 
alternative options are: 
• unserved electricity in years 2007-2009, before the commissioning of the five combined cycle units,
30 MW, in 2010, with the inherent damages caused to consumers (see the rationale for the cost of
unserved energy); 
• installation of five diesel units, 12 MW, and of four wind farms, 10 x 1 MW, in year 2008 
(alternative expansion programme). 
116 This alternative expansion programme will result in additional total cost of 48.2 million US$, as 
shown in the next table.

Alternative –
Reference -64.4 11.5 48.8 39.2 35.1Dominican Republic would be beneficial to both countries, but especially to the lower system, for 
several reasons: 
- Scale effect: larger interconnected system would allow for higher unit sizes with smaller specific 
investments; 
- Peak load of interconnected system lower than the sum of the respective peak loads at isolated
operation and, therefore, lower necessary peak capacities; 
- Mutual assistance in case of unit outages and, consequently, lower necessary reserve capacities; 
- Coordination of unit scheduled maintenance. 
Systematic provision of resources for power generation
118 Currently EDH is facing many problems in procuring the necessary fuel (diesel oil and heavy fuel oil) 
for electricity generation. Sometimes, units are not running because EDH doesn’t have enough financial 
resources to buy fuel or spare parts. Generation division of EDH always elaborates fuel budget that is 
never applied. Therefore, the company must benefit some financial assistance to restart a normal
activity cycle: electricity production – selling - money collection - new production cycle. 
Transmission and distribution network
119 Transmission and distribution network must be rehabilitated to facilitate the energy transfer to the 
customers. Some substations and distribution networks need to be upgraded and due to population
growth and extension of cities. 50,000 new customers per year must be reached but only 15 km of 
extension line are built per year. Broken transformers and poles must be replaced by new ones, too. 
Systematic maintenance of capacities
120 EDH must be given the capability to implement the scheduled maintenance program of its generating 
units and lines according to its internal standards and to the international good practice. 
Periodic study on electric system development
121 The Public Utility Ministry, MTPTC, should undertake periodically (every two years, for example) a 
comprehensive study, with a time horizon of about 10 years, on electric system development, including
generating capacity additions, transmission grid reinforcement, distribution network extension to new
areas, the role of renewable energy resources in grid-connected regions and for local electricity 
production in remote from grid areas (for example, hybrid combinations of small diesel units + wind
farms + solar energy) etc. The conclusions of this study, including the list of necessary investments with 
probable deadlines, should be made available to interested entities (investors, banks etc.). Ministers in
other countries usually publish this public document on their web sites [6]. In this way the prospective 
investors will be informed on the future needs of the utility and will be able to respond to solicited 
timetable and capacity requirements. 
Electricity commercialisation
122 EDH has the objective to increase the billing rate from 47% to 75% during 15 years by: 
- verifying the good conditions of each meter; 
- rehabilitating 9,700 existing meters and connections per year (PREPSEL Project); 
- establishing collective meters for overpopulated areas; 
- eliminating the illegal connexions by using tough measures as arrest, promotion of new energy law
and acquiring new meters and accessories to connect consumers; 
ditht’dbt biltiilif ltiitt 123 The previous measures will contribute also to fulfill the objectives of ICF related to the increase of 
billing rate in Port-au-Prince (reduction of non-technical losses): 
− March 2007: 55%
− September 2007: 57%
− March 2008: 60%
− September 2008: 62%
124 Increase the number of hours of electricity supply per day according to the objectives of ICF: 
 Port-au-Prince Rest of the provincial networks 
− September 2007: 12 hours/day 6 hours/day
− September 2008: 18 hours/day 18 hours/day 
− September 2009: 24 hours/day 24 hours/day 
New legal framework
125 In order to make possible fulfillment of the above objectives the revision of the existing legislation and 
proposal for a new legal framework to appropriately reflect the new situation in the electricity sector is 
necessary. For example, the proposal for the law against illegal connection to the electric networks was 
elaborated and submitted to the parliament before 1998. This proposal was never voted until now, in 
spite of the fact that it is crucial for solving the problem of non-technical losses.
Logistic and human resources
126 The utility company needs to buy new machinery and equipment to improve the maintenance of the 
grid. EDH needs to upgrade and make reliable also its information and telecommunication (IT) system, 
which is not working satisfactorily. Due to political and socio-economic problems, a lot of well-trained
employees left the company to go abroad or to another job. These human resources have not been
replaced and some young employees who just came don’t have enough experience. EDH needs to invest
into staff and technician formation and to hire motivated young engineers. Incentives should be used to
motivate employees, such as a good salary policy. 
4.4 Wind energy 
127 Modern wind farms can produce electricity for US$40-110/MWh, all cost (initial capital cost, 
maintenance) included, depending on the site wind resource variation. For new large wind turbines (> 1 
MW) the investment cost is of about 1500$/kW, while for small wind turbines (< 1 MW) the investment
cost will be higher: 2500-4000 $/kW. Therefore, fiscal (tax incentives) and regulatory instruments (“net 
metering” concept, mandatory dispatching, promoting schemes) might be applied to improve the
economic feasibility of small wind development. Average capacity factor (CF) of wind farms is sitedependent and usually ranges between 19-35%. Reliability has improved steadily and most wind turbine 
manufacturers now guarantee availabilities of 95%. 
128 In the case of renewable energy projects, in general, and also for wind energy projects, one of the main 
prerequisites for attracting potential investors is a basic set of data identifying key resource and 
describing the likely quantity and quality of such resources. In this respect, wind mapping of the country
and site-specific monitoring is necessary. A wind mapping activity is ongoing and is scheduled to be
finished at the end of 2006. 
129 United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) developed the Solar and Wind Energy Resource 
Assessment (SWERA) pilot project (June 2001 – July 2004), for wind and solar resource assessment in 
major areas of developing countries (DCs) in South America, Central America (including Caribbeanprovide high resolution solar and wind resource data and geographic information assessment tools to 
public and private sector executives who are involved in energy market development. The overall goal 
is to promote the integration of wind and solar alternatives in national and regional energy planning and 
sector restructuring as well as related policy-making. Global and regional maps will be available to all
DCs. 
4.5 Solar energy
130 Solar energy can be used in two ways: using solar water heaters (SWH) to produce hot water and thus
to offset the need for electric or fossil fuel water heating or using photovoltaic (PV) cells to convert the
sun’s light into direct current, which can be used as it is or stored in batteries. United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP), Division for Technology, Industry and Economics (DTIE), Solar and 
Wind Energy Resource Assessment (SWERA) pilot project, can provide also detailed information 
(mapping) on the solar resource in Haiti. 
4.6 Municipal solid waste energy
131 The transition strategy of the Haiti Government has three priorities related to solid waste: 
- Ensuring the effective and efficient collection/removal of solid waste in MAPAP and main 
secondary cities; 
- Ensuring an adequate treatment/elimination of solid waste in compliance with social and 
environmental norms; 
- Strengthening the legal, institutional, and financial framework at the national and municipal level, 
including the adoption of a “National Plan for Management of Solid Waste” by March 2007 and 
creation of a National Waste Agency (NWA) by September 2007. No mention is made about the
intention of energy from waste recovery. 
112 The available options for the resource recovery from solid waste are: recycling, composting, incineration 
with/without energy recovery, fuel production through a fermentation process, and landfill disposal
(with/without collection of the methane gas generated by the landfill). The future National Waste Agency
will certainly decide what are the most suitable actions to take on this matter. However, the technologies 
for energy from waste recovery are costly and Haiti probably will not afford them until 2017, the time 
horizon of the present Energy Development Plan.
5 Objectives of the energy policy of the Haitian Government 
132 The objectives of the Haiti Government related to the energy sector are as follows: 
− Support the recapitalization of enterprises in difficulty (case of EDH); 
− Improve and modernize the management of public enterprises in key sectors, including EDH; 
− Improving the production and distribution of electricity in the country; 
− Strengthening the State’s regulatory role in key sectors of the economy, including energy; 
− Prepare and implement the reforms needed to create favorable environment for local and 
foreign investment; 
− Put priority on a significant improvement in the provision of electricity in the country; 
− Promotion of alternatives to fuel wood and the promotion of renewable energies. 
133 More specifically, the Government of Haiti has established the following priority objectives for EDH: 
− Establishment of a management contract for EDH 
− Maintain electrical service for at least 12 hours per day in Port-au-Prince and in the rest of the 
country; 
Stbilitif EDH d tbliht f ditifit− Special attention to improve collection rate and commercial profitability; 
− Reduction of fraud and theft of electricity; 
− Obtaining better conditions in the PPA contracts with private producers, taking into account 
the interests of both parties. 
134 To stabilize EDH and enhance its services, a medium-term (5 years) management contract is 
envisaged, as well as implementation of a medium-term investment plan designed to increase access to
electricity of the population from 12.5% at present to 20% by 2013. 
135 Conservation of natural resources, especially forests. This can be done by several measures: 
− Support for more efficient use of charcoal and fuel wood; 
− Reforestation of strategic areas for safety of population, environmental protection and 
tourism;
− Generation of energetic forests; 
− Conversion to diesel, bio-diesel and to LPG of 1,000 small enterprises that use wood as fuel; 
− Financial support to cellulose briquette producers; 
− Initiation of a study to determine the feasibility of wood imports or exchanges with lime; 
− Promotion of renewable energies (wind and solar) through institutional reinforcement (and 
improved access for the poor to energy services).
136 Promotion of bio-fuels. This can be achieved through incentives for growing energetic crops and by 
encouraging investments in facilities for bio-fuels production and use. Main bio-fuels are bio-diesel,
ethanol and methanol produced from bagasse and different fast growing plants. 
6 Energy sector reform 
137 The reform of energy sector today should be guided by the idea of finding the most suitable form of 
partnership between public needs and private interests. Haiti public needs in energy sector are mainly
defined by the terrible deforestation of the country and low level of electricity supply. Public interest is 
to switch cooking from firewood and charcoal to fossil fuels, and increase the efficiency of cooking, and
to enlarge electricity distribution network, to connect more households to the grid, to have secure and 
reliable electricity supply and increase electricity generation capacity. Private interest is to make profit. 
Only market forces are not capable to acceptably solve all of these issues. There is need for state
intervention through the reform of energy sector, institutional and legal framework, new institutions 
such as a regulatory entity and new and immediate measures. In such a design of rules in energy sector, 
there must be enough space for private capital, and through the laws and secondary legislation, clear and
secure way to make profit in energy activities. 
138 There is a need to prepare the Concept of Energy Sector Reform compatible with this National Energy 
Plan. This Concept, adopted by government, must have the consensus of all parties in the country. In
such a concept must be stressed the basic ideas about all main issues in energy sector, including the
ways of privatisation, ways of development of energy markets, ways of regulation, ways of 
implementing renewable energy sources and energy efficiency, needed new institutions and measures 
etc. After the adoption of such an integral concept, there is need to prepare Energy law and secondary 
legislation. 
139 Basically, Haiti needs to develop transmission and distribution of electricity. Generation of electricity, 
especially in new units could be private through the concept of IPP (Independent Power Producer) is 
now a reality in Haiti. The presence of IPPs, plus free access to the electric networks define the concept
of the “single buyer market”. 
140 In order to have a management with better skills immediately, which is really needed, there is the 
ill dfhf hlil kIhihiibhinterested to maximise the profit through slow enlargement of networks. If such operators have to build
and operate networks, it is necessary to introduce new institutions, regulation of energy activities, to 
define tariffs and interest rate on invested capital, and to protect the consumers. 
141 Oil products market is typically a private activity, but in order to prevent deforestation by replacing
fuel wood and charcoal consumption with LPG and kerosene, there are needs to have clear definition of
relations between private investors and government (subsides, incentives), which can be defined in Oil
sector law and secondary legislation. For the implementation of these laws a National Authority and 
agencies working on site need to be established. 7 Energy sector development plan

Appendix 1: Final energy consumption per capita in Latin America and Caribbean in 2001
Appendix 2: Final energy intensity in Latin America and Caribbean in 2001Average heat content of fuel wood: 10-20MJ/kg, depending of the moisture content; lets suppose 
15MJ/kg for an average moisture content; average heat content of charcoal: 30MJ/kg; Heat content of 
5 kg of wood = 5 x 15MJ = 75MJ; Heat content of 1 kg of charcoal = 30MJ; So, the conversion 
efficiency is 30/75 = 40% for average moisture wood, 30/50 = 60% for high moisture wood and 
30/100 = 30% for low moisture wood; Depending on what kind of wood is used for charcoal

Appendix 10: Potential domestic production of alternative transport fuels (biodiesel, 
ethanol, methanol) 
Biodiesel : (Fatty acid methyl ester): domestically produced, renewable fuel that can be manufactured 
from vegetable oils (which can come from soy, rapeseed, linseed or sunflower seeds), animal fats, or
recycled vegetable cooking oil and greases collected from restaurants, hotels, schools etc. Blends of 
20% biodiesel with 80% petroleum diesel (B20) can generally be used in unmodified diesel engines. 
Biodiesel can also be used in its pure form (B100), but it too may require certain engine modifications 
to avoid maintenance and performance problems. A 5% blend is sold in France. Biodiesel is safe, 
biodegradable, and reduces serious air pollutants such as particulates, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, 
and air toxics. Emissions of nitrogen oxides increase with the concentration of biodiesel in the fuel. 
Glycerine (used in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, among other markets), lecithin and vitamin E are 
produced also as by-products. Biodiesel production represents also a positively recycling of waste 
cooking oil, which constitutes a serious environmental problem. Possible incentives: lower taxation
than standard diesel. 
Ethanol : (Ethyl alcohol): alcohol-based alternative fuel produced from any biological feedstoks that contain
appreciable amounts of sugar (sugar beets, sugar cane) or materials that can be converted into sugar, as starch
(corn, barley and wheat) or cellulose (trees and grasses). The ethanol produced from "cellulosic biomass" such 
as trees and grasses is called bioethanol. Ethanol is most commonly used to increase octane and improve the
emissions quality of gasoline. Ethanol can be blended with gasoline to create E85 (a blend of 85% ethanol and 
15% gasoline) or with even higher concentrations of ethanol, E95. Techniques are under development to make
ethanol from waste paper, sawdust and other low-cost materials. All today’s petrol motors can operate with 10% 
ethanol mixed with gasoline without the need for adjustments. Jamaica is looking into producing ethanol from 
sugar cane to reduce oil imports and the high cost associated with it. bagasse or wood chips. Methanol is a liquid fuel that can be used in an internal combustion engine or a 
fuel cell. 
Appendix 11: Electricity generation system least cost expansion programme 
According to the results of the MAED study, the electricity peak load will increase with about 150 MW from 
year 2000 to 2010 and with 165 MW from 2010 to 2015 due to economic and social development of the 
country. 
Artibonite region is expected to be connected to the main transmission grid in 2013-2015, when the maximal 
load will be 30 MW. Region North will be interconnected in 2013-2015 with a peak of 37 MW. Because of its 
low consumption and long distance to the existing transmission grid, the region South will be not connected to
main transmission grid until 2022. In 2015, this region will reach the maximal load of 26 MW. All load and 
electrical energy needs of these three regions, in the specified time horizons, will be covered with small diesel
units, wind farms and small hydro units. Until 2015 the following new capacities will be required: 25 MW in 
region Artibonite (until 2012), 25 MW in region South and 30 MW in region North. 
In the same time, some existing electricity generation capacities will be retired, as they will reach their standard
lifetime: about 50 MW during the period 2000-2010 and 45 MW between 2010 and 2015. Therefore, new 
electricity generation capacities will be necessary to be installed to meet the electricity demand with a 
satisfactory level of reliability of the electricity supply. If some 20% of reserve capacities are considered, than 
about 200 MW of new capacities must be installed between 2000-2012 and 240 MW between 2012-2017. The 
least cost expansion programme for the Haitian electricity generation system will be determined using the 
IAEA’s model WASP. 
WASP model is designed to find the economically optimal expansion policy for an electric utility system within 
user specified constraints. It utilises probabilistic estimation of system production costs, unserved energy costs,
and reliability, linear programming technique for determining optimal dispatch policy satisfying exogenous
constraints on environmental emissions, fuel availability and electricity generation by some plants, and the
dynamic programming method for optimising the costs of alternative system expansion policies. 
In order to obtain sound expansion cost evaluations for period until to 2017, a longer period (till 2022) will be
considered for the WASP model analysis. have to be done during the period 2007-2017. Building a new power plant requires however a preparation 
period consisting in studies and construction time, variable from one technology to another. Therefore, for the 
immediate future (2007-2009) some purchase of electricity by EDH from private companies and technologies 
requiring quick construction time (diesel engines, wind farms) should be considered. 
ICF plan propose the addition of 2 diesel units of 12 MW at Carrefour power station in 2007, one new power 
station of 120 MW (6 x 20 MW) in 2012 and some units out of Port-au-Prince (combined cycle, if it is 
possible). No hydro units are provided in ICF plan but Haiti has a good hydro potential. 
Having in mind all above considerations, the following electricity generation system expansion options have 
been considered: 
Technology type Fuel Size Construction time Available for 
operation from year: 
Diesel engines Imported heavy fuel 2.5 MW < 1 year 2007

No other hydro options have been considered because the respective technical and economic data were not 
available in the detailed format as required by WASP model. In addition to the above electricity generation 
system expansion options, the purchase of electricity by EDH from private companies or from Dominican 
Republic, if possible, is considered as a transitory solution for the period 2007-2009. hnical and economic characteristics assumed for the above electricity generation system expansion op

The unit size of 2.5 MW or sometimes multiples of this size are suitable for the small annual increase in
electricity demand of the respective regions. The localisation by regions of these units, in terms of installed
capacity, would be as follows: region Artibonite – 22.5 MW until 2015, region South – 20 MW, region North – 
27.5 MW and 10 MW for West until 2017. 
All the other expansion options were subject to WASP model optimisation, and the least cost development
programme for the Haitian electricity generation system has been determined based on the following 
hypothesis: 
• unserved energy cost of 1US$/kWh; 
• discount rate of 14%; 
• salvage value of assets determined based on linear depreciation method; 
• possibility of electricity purchase by EDH from private companies at a similar cost to that of the
existing purchase agreement (supply fuel and pay a certain amount for the purchased electricity) which 
results in a total cost of about 100 US$/MWh. 
Optimisation criterion is the minimization of the total discounted cost (investment + operation + unserved
energy – salvage value) of all possible expansion paths for the electricity generation system. 
The selected value of the discount rate is consistent with the figures being currently used in similar studies 
undertaken for Haiti, with the current interest rates practised by the banks for credits and with relatively high 
country risk for private investments in Haiti. 
The cost of unserved energy is a kind of penalty for the electricity non-supplied to customers and reflects the
average value of damages they may have if not supplied with electricity according to the agreed reliability
standards. The rationale of the penalty for the unsupplied electricity demand is the following: 
• When used in economic productive sectors, the electricity contributes to economic growth, creation of new 
jobs, and consequently to additional revenues for individuals, poverty alleviation. 
• When used in social services (culture, education, medical assistance etc.) and in households, electricity use
has beneficial effects, more difficult to evaluate in monetary terms but undeniable from social viewpoint: Unsupplied electricity constitutes, therefore, a loss of these economic and social benefits and must be penalised 
in the energy planning studies. If not penalised, the unsupplied electricity represents the cheapest
“development” option for electricity generation system. 
In assessing the average cost of unserved energy for WASP calculations, two reference figures were available: 
− the current marginal electricity supply cost of about 100US$/MWh for the existing electricity purchase 
agreement; 
− the final electricity intensity (ratio of annual final electricity consumption to total GDP) for Haiti in year 
2000 is, according to MAED study, of 0.256 MWh / 1000 US$ (762 GWh / 2970 million US$), which is 
equivalent to about 3,900 US$/MWh. 
The selected value of unserved energy for WASP calculations is of 1 US$/kWh, which is equivalent to 1000 
US$/MWh and represents an intermediate penalty, ten times higher than the current marginal electricity supply 
option (100 US$/MWh) and 39 times lower than the equivalent (3,900 US$/MWh) of the average final
electricity intensity at the country level. Sensitivity studies will be necessary to see how robust is the least cost
expansion programme to the variation of the above economic parameters. 
In determining the least cost expansion programme for the Haitian electricity generation system, a difficult
decision has to be taken for the very next years (2007-2008) when some of the considered system development 
options: combustion turbines (simple cycle), combustion turbines (combined cycle), steam power plant, hydro power plant
are not available for operation because their respective construction time and other practical reasons. In fact, for 
the very near future only the following electricity supply options are available: installation of small diesel 
engines (2.5 MW) in some isolated regional networks and additional purchase of electricity by EDH from 
private companies, which can be applied from 2007 and installation of diesel engines (12 MW) and/or wind 
farms, which could be operational from 2008. 
After the consideration of all the above electricity supply options, with their respective constraints, the reference 
least cost programme of electricity generation system expansion and operation determined with WASP model is 
the following:

The following comments can be made in relation with the above least cost programme of electricity generation 
system expansion and operation: 
− the installation programme for the small diesel engines (2.5 MW) in isolated regional networks has beenunits of 12 MW at Carrefour power station in 2007, one new power station of 120 MW (6 x 20 MW) in
2012 and some units out of Port-au-Prince (combined cycle, if possible); 
− the diesel engines of 12 MW are not chosen in competition with the electricity purchase in period 2007-
2009 and with installation of combustion turbines (combined cycle), 30 MW, in period 2010-2017 because 
of their high overnight pure capital investment cost (950 US$/kW) and of their low efficiency (30-33%); 
− the wind farms of 10 x 1 MW are not selected in competition with the electricity purchase in period 2007-
2009 and with installation of combustion turbines (combined cycle), 30 MW, in period 2010-2017 because 
of their high overnight pure capital investment cost (1500 US$/kW) and low capacity factor of 30%
(reflected in WASP calculations through the forced outage rate parameter); 
− the combustion turbines (simple cycle), in all size options, are not selected in competition with the
electricity purchase in year 2009 and with installation of combustion turbines (combined cycle), 30 MW, in 
period 2010-2017 because of their lower efficiency (30-35%); 
− the combustion turbines (combined cycle) of 30 MW are preferred to all other expansion options, starting
with their first year of availability for operation (2008), because of their higher efficiency (40-55%); this 
technology can have a even higher efficiency but conservative figures have been selected purposely in this
study;
− the size of 30 MW for the combined cycle units is preferred to the other two sizes (60 MW and 120 MW) 
for the same technology, in spite of its higher specific investment cost, because of its better fit with the low 
annual increase of the electricity demand; 
− the lignite-fired steam power plant, 30 MW, is not selected in competition with combustion turbines 
(combined cycle), 30 MW, because of its higher overnight pure capital investment cost (2300 US$/kW) and 
of its lower efficiency (23-30%); 
− the hydro power plant Artibonite 4C is selected for installation in 2014, one year after its availability for
operation in year 2012.

Note: 1. IDC - Interest during construction It should be mentioned that the cost of new capacity construction are not specified for the commissioning year 
of the unit but for its construction years, according to the “S curve” of capital expenditure. 
The average cost of the sent out electricity from the power plants, calculated as the ratio of the “discounted total 
expansion and operation cost” and “discounted electricity demand” is of 87.9 US$/MWh (8.79 US¢/kWh) if 
calculated for the period 2007-2017, and 84.7 US$/MWh (8.47 US¢/kWh) if calculated for the period 2005-
2020. The average cost is lower when calculated for the period 2007-2022 because between 2018-2022 many 
existing generating units with low efficiency are retired and replaced with combined cycle units with higher 
efficiency. 
The total costs for electricity generation system expansion and operation will represent between 3.1% (in 2007) 
and 5.6% (in 2009) of the total GDP of Haiti, out of which the expansion costs will be between 0.3% (in 2007)
and 2.4% (in 2009) of total GDP. As it can be noticed, the year 2009 will be the year with the highest financial
effort both for the operation of the electricity generation system and for its expansion (in this year several 
combined cycle units, 30 MW, and two diesel units, 2.5 MW, will be in different construction stages. 
The above least cost expansion programme is valid for the following intervals of variation of the main economic 
parameters: 
• discount rate: 14-19%; 
• cost of unserved energy: 0.6-1.2 US$/kWh; 
• cost of additional electricity purchases from private companies: inferior or equal to 126 US$/MWh. 
For the discount rate of 13%, the hydro power plant Artibonite 4C is advanced by one year, in 2014 instead of
2015. For the discount rate of 12%, the hydro power plant Artibonite 4C is also advanced in 2014 but, in
addition, one wind farm is included as part of the least cost expansion programme in year 2008 and some
combined cycle units, 30 MW, are postponed with one year, the total number in years 2017 and 2022 remaining
the same. For the discount rate of 20%, the hydro power plant Artibonite 4C is not selected anymore as part of
the least cost expansion programme and, on the other hand, some combined cycle units, 30 MW, are advanced 
by one year, 12 units being asked until 2017, instead of 11 units in the reference expansion programme. 
For the cost of unserved energy of 0.5 US$/kWh, only 10 combined cycle units, 30 MW, are asked until 2017, 
instead of 11 units in the reference least cost expansion programme and three wind farms are selected in years
2008, 2012 and 2014. For the cost of unserved energy of 1.3 US$/kWh, some combined cycle units, 30 MW, 
are advanced by one year but the total number of asked units until 2017 remain the same (11 units). 
For the cost of additional electricity purchases from private companies equal or superior to 127 US$/MWh the 
installation of a wind farm in year 2008 become more attractive than the electricity purchase. 
The annual amounts of additional electricity purchases by EDH from local private companies or from 
Dominican Republic (if possible) are quite large: 166 GWh in 2007 (14.4% of the estimated annual electricity 
demand), 212 GWh in 2008 (17.0%) and 266 GWh in 2007 (19.8%). If they are not available at a cost inferior 
or equal to 126 US$/MWh or they are not entirely available, than the only possible alternative options are: 
• unserved electricity in years 2007-2009, before the commissioning of the five combined cycle units, 30 
MW, in 2010, with the inherent damages caused to consumers (see the rationale for the cost of unserved 
energy); 
• installation of five diesel units, 12 MW, and of four wind farms, 10 x 1 MW, in year 2008 (alternative 
expansion programme). This alternative expansion programme will result in additional total costs of 35.1 million US$, as shown in the
next table.

The construction costs of the new capacities are higher in the case of Haitian electricity generation system
because of its small size, asking for small unit sizes with higher specific investment cost than the larger similar
units. From this point of view, a deeper integration of the electric systems of Haiti and Dominican Republic 
would be beneficial to both countries, but especially to the lower system, for several reasons: 
- Scale effect: larger interconnected system would allow for higher unit sizes with smaller specific 
investments; 
- Peak load of interconnected system lower than the sum of the respective peak loads at isolated operation 
and, therefore, lower necessary peak capacities; 
- Mutual assistance in case of unit outages and, consequently, lower necessary reserve capacities; 
- Coordination of unit scheduled maintenance. 
Appendix 12 Improvement of electricity tariff system 
MTPTC and the future regulatory entity should consider the improvement of the current electricity 
tariff system. As a general rule, energy prices in a country should reflect the economic cost of 
products. If subsidies are to be provided, they must be only on direct bases (for example, for a limited 
monthly electricity consumption by poor consumers – “life line tariff”). If not targeted correctly, i.e. 
only for really poor, the subsidised tariff of electricity will benefit primarily to welfare consumers
which will be invited to waste energy, and thus to tie up the scarce governmental resources. Energy 
prices have to provide correct signals to producers and consumers, to encourage energy efficiency and 
energy conservation. Correct pricing of commercial energy and efficient billing, accounting and 
collection systems are important elements in a sustainable energy system, as low energy prices or
“free” (stolen) energy result in inefficient energy use and economically unsustainable energy supply 
companies. 
The electricity rate setting should reflect the following principles: 
Rates should reflect full costs of generation, transmission, distribution and selling. The shift from the 
current rates to tentative ones can be done gradually but the ultimate objective must be followed 
unconditionally; 
Tariffs should be structured according to long run marginal cost (LRMC) principles: different tariff 
components for maximum power required (kW) and for energy consumption (kWh), different tariff by 
voltage level (higher tariff for lower voltage level) and for peak and off peak consumption (higher 
tariff for peak);not to the nature of their activity; allow consumers to choose the favourable type of tariff between the 
available ones; 
 A form of indexing should be carried out according to the fuel cost and inflation fluctuation.
