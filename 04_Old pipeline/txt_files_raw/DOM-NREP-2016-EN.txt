with a number of challenges, such as fuel import dependence, 
exposure to oil price volatility and uncertain energy supplies that 
constrain its economic development. Although one of the largest 
and most diverse economies in the Caribbean, it still relies on 
imported fossil fuels for nearly all of its energy needs.
However, the Dominican Republic has set out to tackle these 
challenges by scaling up its renewable energy resources, which can help meet energy demand 
while delivering significant socio-economic benefits. It aims to use 25% more renewable power 
by 2025.
Accelerated deployment of renewables in the Dominican Republic would cut energy costs for 
consumers, create new employment opportunities, stimulate economic activity and help meet 
international climate commitments, in line with the Paris agreement. In addition, it would reduce 
local pollution, improve public health and strengthen energy security. 
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) supports countries in achieving their 
sustainable energy transition through realistic, achievable technology and resource options. 
REmap – IRENA’s global renewable energy roadmap – offers valuable insights on the opportunities 
and challenges ahead.
The Dominican Republic should establish an enabling institutional and regulatory framework 
for renewables, along with adequate financial incentives to attract investment. With the right 
measures in place, variable sources like solar and wind can be smoothly integrated into the grid, 
and the country can tap into its vast potential for renewables in the heating, cooling and transport 
sectors.
The key actions outlined in this report can help accelerate the energy transition. Moreover, the 
experience of the Dominican Republic can provide useful lessons for other island nations seeking 
to achieve sustainable energy future.

FOREWORD FROM IRENAThe Dominican Republic is one of the ten most vulnerable 
countries to the effects of climate change. At the same time, our 
country needs to treat the specific contributions pledged under 
the Paris Agreement extremely seriously.
For our part, we fully recognise that achieving the objectives 
of those accords depends on the fulfilment of our own commitments. These mainly involve 
renewable energy development, as well as improving energy efficiency across the board.
This roadmap, therefore, is vitally important to the Dominican Republic reinforcing political 
decisions and identifying the main challenges to be faced in pursuit of our objectives. Along with 
adopting specific commitments, such analysis is essential to enable us to meet our goals.
This report on the Dominican Republic should be the first of many opportunities for collaboration 
through the National Energy Commission (CNE) and IRENA, with the aim of putting us on course 
for the development of renewable energy projects, especially in the electricity sector, and to 
ensure that by 2030 we have reliable, efficient, environmentally sustainable energy.

International Renewable Energy Agency REmap programme
By 2014, renewable energy use amounted to 18% of global total final energy consumption (TFEC). If existing 
and proposed energy plans and targets of countries are aggregated, the global renewable energy share by 
2030 would increase to 21%. This represents a continuation of past growth trends in renewable energy share.1
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) REmap programme shows it is possible to actually 
double the global share of renewable energy by 2030 compared to 2014. Such accelerated growth helps 
fulfil the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) for affordable and clean energy, and contributes to climate 
change mitigation.
REmap is a roadmap based on close cooperation and consultation with experts (energy statisticians, energy 
modellers and energy policy experts) nominated by governments. It is an analysis of the potential, costs and 
savings of renewable energy technology options. REmap provides a perspective on the technology options 
available at the sector level that represent the realistic potential of renewables beyond national energy 
targets and plans. These technology options are aggregated to build technology cost curves. As of July 
2016, REmap works with more than 40 countries responsible for over 80% of current global energy demand.
Context
The Dominican Republic is one of the largest and most diverse economies in the Caribbean region, and its 
energy consumption is growing rapidly. The country relies heavily on fossil fuel imports, which account for 
nearly all of its primary energy supply at present.
The Dominican Republic has set ambitious targets to reduce its per capita greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 
Another objective is to reduce import dependency and the local and global impacts of fossil fuel combustion 
on the environment, including those associated with climate change. The target is to reduce GHG emissions 
by 25% by 2030 compared to 2010. Realising this target will require a shift in the country’s energy mix. 
Renewable energy can play a key role in achieving the climate policy objectives as well as energy supply 
diversification. Moreover, accelerated renewable energy deployment can reduce energy cost for consumers 
and reduce the fuel imports bill. In 2014, renewable energy share in total final energy of the Dominican 
Republic stood at 16.3% (8.7% modern renewables and 7.6% traditional biomass use, Figure ES2).
The power sector is key for an increase in the share of renewable energy. At the moment power generation is 
predominantly based on hydrocarbons, as shown in Figure ES1. In recent years the sector has gone through 
a series of reforms to ensure secure and affordable electricity supply to consumers. This has been met with 
mixed success so far. As part of these reforms, Law 57-072 sets specific targets for the power sector to 
increase its share of renewables in the power generation mix to 25% by 2025. To achieve this target, a number 
of policy instruments have been introduced, including tax incentives and feed-in tariffs. A rural electrification 
programme also supports the deployment of renewable off-grid projects, and the country is extending its 
grid infrastructure to ensure universal electricity access. Furthermore, a blackout reduction programme aims 
to improve the quality of the power supply service to the population.
1 Renewable energy includes bioenergy, geothermal, hydropower, ocean, solar and wind energy.
2 Law 57-07 of 7 May 2007 on Renewable Sources of Energy Incentives and its Special Regimes.In this evolving environment characterised by increasing electricity demand, the pipeline of new power 
generation projects amounts to 2.4 gigawatts (GW). Of this total, 66% is renewable energy capacity – mainly 
onshore wind and hydropower. The country has significant additional renewable energy potential to go 
beyond what is being planned. This relates not only to power but also to direct uses of renewables for 
residential and commercial buildings, industry and transport.
This roadmap was developed in close co-operation with the National Energy Commission (Comisión Nacional 
de Energía or CNE). It quantifies what can realistically be achieved by 2030 in the Dominican Republic’s total 
energy system in terms of renewable energy technology potential, cost and savings. CNE has provided the 
background energy and economic data for the analysis, and the potential has been worked out by IRENA with 
CNE’s experts. This is the first report prepared for the Dominican Republic covering its entire energy system. 
As described in this roadmap, each sector has a number of specific challenges relating to the accelerated 
deployment of renewable energy technologies. With the right policy framework and technical solutions, the 
Dominican Republic can be a key country in the region attracting significant investment in renewable energy.
A rapidly developing power system
The Dominican Republic power sector is developing rapidly. The reforms that started in the late 1990s have 
shaped its current structure. As a result of these reforms, activities across the power supply chain have been 
unbundled, and private sector participation has increased.
The national interconnected system (Sistema Eléctrico Nacional Interconectado de la República Dominicana 
or SENI) supplies 87% of all the electricity consumed in the country. The high voltage transmission network 
belongs to a single, state-owned company (Empresa de Transmisión Eléctrica Dominicana or ETED). Three 
public sector companies distribute 78% of all the electricity consumed, with concessions in three different 
geographical zones. Seven smaller, mostly privately owned companies, generate and distribute electricity

Note: 1 kilotonne of oil equivalent (ktoe) = 41.868 megajoules (MJ)in noninterconnected zones. High electricity losses, at the distribution level in the three main concessions, 
currently affect the power system. This situation is being addressed by the government because it jeopardises 
the economic viability of the system.
Total national demand for electricity has experienced a rapid growth of approximately 45% over the 
past decade. Electricity generation reached 18 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2014 from a total installed power 
generation capacity of around 4.9 GW (including SENI, off-grid installations and autoproducers).3 More than 
60% of the installed capacity runs on oil products, mainly heavy fuel oil which is especially polluting.
Renewable energy technologies account for 15% of total installed capacity. The national share of renewable 
energy in the power sector is about 11.5% of total electricity generation. This consists of 9% hydropower, 
1.5% onshore wind and 1% bioenergy. The remaining 0.1% is met by solar photovoltaic (PV). This is displayed 
in Figure ES1. Installed capacity and generation from renewables is rising at the same rate as demand for 
electricity.
The renewables share in non-power sectors is thus far limited to bioenergy for industrial heating (amounting 
to 27% of direct uses of energy in industry) as well as cooking and water heating in buildings (representing 
41% of traditional biomass plus 8% of modern bioenergy use, in the non-power energy demand in this sector). 
Deployment in these sectors has been mainly driven by private initiatives. No policy directed at these sectors 
exist yet.
REmap analysis: renewable energy prospects for the Dominican 
Republic
The Dominican Republic’s total demand for final energy will grow by 2.2% per year between now and 2030, 
reaching 7 677 ktoe per year. These figures are based on the preliminary results of the CNE energy demand 
3 From the total installed capacity in this year, the SENI accounts for 3.7 GW and the autoproducers and off-grid installations 
represented about 0.9 GW and 0.3 GW respectively

Note: End-use sectors include renewable energy consumption from direct uses and electricityprojections for 2013-2030, worked out with Fundación Bariloche, which form the basis of the Reference Case 
(or business as usual). In the Reference Case, the share of modern renewable energy would be 13% of the total 
final energy mix by 2030, compared to 9% in 2014 (excluding traditional uses of bioenergy).
The Dominican Republic has abundant solar and wind resources. Several sources of small hydropower are not 
utilised. Agricultural residue and waste are the predominant potential sources of bioenergy supply. These can 
be used to meet growing demand and raise the share of renewables beyond the Reference Case.
Meanwhile, the renewable energy share of total electricity generation in the Reference Case rises from around 
12% in 2014 to 21% by 2030 if all renewable energy projects in the pipeline come online. This would imply 
that the target of 25% of renewable electricity generation by 2025 set in Law 57-07 might be missed in the 
Reference Case, thus there is a need for additional policies. According to the Reference Case, the share of 
renewable energy in end-use sectors experiences a slight increase between 2014 and 2030, from 21% to 23% 
in industry, 9% to 16% in buildings and 0.3% to 0.8% in transport. This is displayed in Figure ES2.
Implementing the potential additional renewable energy technology options identified in REmap would 
increase the renewable energy share to 27% by 2030 in the Dominican Republic’s total final energy mix. 
Industry and the power sector could have the highest renewable energy share, estimated at 43% and 44% 
respectively. This would be followed by buildings and transport at 40% and 5% each.
Under REmap, final renewable energy use could double to 2 080 ktoe per year by 2030 compared to the 
Reference Case. Bioenergy would be the largest source of renewable energy accounting for almost half 
of total final renewable energy use in 2030. This is explained by its various uses across all energy sectors, 
including power generation. Solar energy for power generation, heating and cooling would account for 
20%. Finally, wind and hydropower would represent 21% and 14% of the total final renewable energy use, 
respectively.
Wind and solar lead renewable power generation
Under REmap, 54% of all final renewable energy use is related to the consumption of power from renewables 
in 2030 as shown in Figure ES3. Data provided by CNE and IRENA estimates show that the Dominican 
Republic could generate 16 TWh of electricity from renewables by 2030. This would be produced from a 
renewable power generation capacity of 6 GW (from a total installed capacity of 10 GW, including nonrenewable technologies). Renewable electricity generation under REmap is higher than current levels by a 
factor of eight and significantly higher than the country’s planned expansion in the Reference Case (7.7 TWh

 direct uses mainly from hydropower and onshore wind). To realise the potential identified in Remap, the country’s major 
onshore wind and solar resources need to be utilised. These are also among the most cost-effective options 
in the mix.
Onshore wind would be the single largest source of renewable power producing 6.1 TWh electricity per 
year. The total wind capacity if all REmap Options are implemented is 2.3 GW in 2030. This translates into 
the construction of about 45 wind farms between now and 2030. Wind projects would be spread across the 
northern, eastern and southern parts of the country as shown in Figure ES4.
Solar PV could contribute 3 TWh from a total of 1.7 GW capacity under REmap by 2030. This potential 
includes both on-grid (utility-scale and decentralised) and off-grid capacity. About 60% of this potential is 
related to utility-scale plants, which would require an average annual installation rate of about 77 megawatts 
(MW) between now and 2030. Decentralised on-grid generation comprises 685 MW capacity by 2030 
for residential and commercial systems that would cover about 8% of all electricity demand in buildings. 
According to REmap, these solar projects would be split between the two major demand centres of Santo 
Domingo and Santiago as shown in Figure ES4. Solar home systems totalling 102 MW of installed capacity 
would supply electricity to 2% of the population, which will still lack access in 2030 (about 70 000 units).
Bioenergy and waste constitute other important source of renewable power generation. There is potential to 
increase total bioenergy capacity from landfill gas, bagasse and biogas, as well as through co-firing. By 2030, 
total installed capacity could reach 448 MW under REmap. This is divided into four sources. Firstly, landfill 
gas from the large Duquese and the other major landfills could supply 220 MW. The four largest sugar mills 
in the country could reach 148 MW bagasse based combined heat and power. Finally, animal manure could 
supply 9 MW in biogas and co-firing of biomass in coal fired power plants could supply another 70 MW. Most 
bioenergy projects would be in the southern parts of the country.

The other half of final renewable energy use under REmap, besides renewable power, comes from the 
direct use of renewables in end-use sectors. However, until now the national energy plans of the Dominican 
Republic do not make use of this potential.
Renewables for industrial heating offers the greatest potential among all end-use applications. Mediumtemperature process heat can be generated from industrial combined heat and power based on bagasse. 
Likewise, solar thermal systems can be employed to deliver low-temperature heat and cold. Under REmap, 
100 heating and about 85 cooling installations can be implemented in the industry plants by 2030, 
representing a total capacity of 125 MW.
In buildings, solar water heating capacity could reach 1.4 GW to deliver half of all energy demand for water 
heating in residential and commercial buildings – mainly hotels, under REmap. Demand for cooling has 
increased considerably. The main drivers for cooling are increased income, growing population and the 
hospitality sector. Solar cooling and seawater cooling systems can cover 20% and 5% of the total space 
cooling demand of the buildings respectively.
Hostelries generate significant amounts of organic waste among others, from cooking and from collected 
waste food that can be reconverted into biogas, using anaerobic digestion, usable as an energy source for 
cooking. About 100 such digesters can be installed by 2030 into hotels in the Dominican Republic, supplying 
the equivalent of 10% of the energy used for cooking in hostelry.
Under current policies, only limited growth is forecast for renewable energy in transport, which only includes 
biodiesel usage. Ethanol and electric mobility provide significant additional potential. This would be an 
important step for a sector that represents the largest share of total final energy demand in the Dominican 
Republic. Thousands hectares of land were previously used for sugar cane production. A share of now 
fallow arable land can once again be used for sugar cane production for ethanol. By 2030, more than 
170 million litres of conventional ethanol could be produced, allowing a blending rate of 15%, which requires 
flex-fuel vehicles. For biodiesel, a blending rate of 5% is estimated, for a total consumption of 50 million litres. 
The production of conventional liquid biofuels must be derived from sustainable sources and not compete 
with resources required for food production.
The number of four-wheel electric vehicles by 2030 could reach 220 000, representing 15% of the total 
passenger car stock. Two and three-wheeled electric vehicles have major potential, especially in congested 
parts of cities and in tourist resorts. Realistically, 500 000 such vehicles can be deployed by 2030. In 
summary these are opportunities to combine electric mobility with renewable power supply.
The energy storage offered by all types of electric vehicles represent a total capacity of 1.4 gigawatt-hours. 
This can provide significant flexibility to facilitate the management of the variability from wind and solar 
generation.
Significant savings to renewable energy mix in 2030
Increasing the Dominican Republic’s renewable energy share to 27% of its final energy mix would result 
in financial savings. In the REmap analysis, the cost and savings of renewables are estimated from both 
business and government perspectives. The business perspective is based on national energy prices which 
include local taxes and subsidies and uses a national discount rate of 12%. The government perspective is 
based on standard international commodity prices and a fixed 10% discount rate. The cost analysis in this 
roadmap is based on 2030 capital cost projections for energy technologies. It assumes an average increase 
of 40% in local fossil fuel prices between 2010 and 2030 (in real terms) and also no change to present energy pricing schemes. Assessment excludes the costs for infrastructure (e.g. additional generation or transmission 
capacity) and enabling technology costs (e.g. grid integration).
Under REmap, more than 80% of all renewable energy technology options could be deployed with financial 
savings when compared with the non-renewable technology counterparts they replace. From the business 
perspective, the mix of renewable energy technologies identified on top of the Reference Case translates 
into savings across all sectors of USD 62 per megawatt-hour of final renewable energy (or USD 17 per 
gigajoule – GJ). From a government perspective, this results in savings of USD 68 per megawatt-hour of final 
renewable energy (or USD 19/ GJ). This translates into total annual savings of USD 1 billion in the Dominican 
Republic energy system. A small proportion of the technologies will incur additional costs and will require 
total investment support of about USD 160 million per year.
Savings are also achieved due to reduced externalities from avoided carbon dioxide (CO2) and air 
pollutant emissions as estimated in this roadmap. When accounting for these reduced externalities, 
additional annual savings could range from USD 1.1-4.3 billion by 2030. This would result in total savings of 
USD 2.1 billion-5.3 billion per year.4
The health savings are estimated on the basis of the unit external costs of the five major outdoor air 
pollutant emissions caused by fossil fuel combustion in power generation, heating and transport.5 Traditional 
bioenergy use in households for cooking and water heating also results in indoor air pollution. These unit 
external costs are specifically applied to the case of the Dominican Republic by accounting for the expected 
4 The costs of renewables have been compared with the non-renewable energy technologies assuming a relatively high growth in 
crude oil prices to 2030 and the assessment of externalities has been carried out based on a set of standard parameters that may 
overestimate the savings in the context of islands. Therefore, a sensitivity analysis of these findings is provided in the full report.
5 The five air pollutants assessed include: ammonia, mono-nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, sulphur dioxide and volatile organic 
compounds.

reductiondevelopments in its gross domestic product by 2030. In addition, the calculation assumed a price range of 
USD 17–80 per tonne of CO2 with the same range applied to all other countries in the REmap programme.
In addition to these savings, the replacement of non-renewable technologies by renewables in REmap 
cuts fossil fuel demand by almost 2 170 ktoe by 2030 compared to business as usual. Much of this reduced 
demand is imported fossil fuel that lowers the annual energy bill by USD 1.6 billion in 2030.
Total investments in renewable energy technologies needed to attain the 27% renewable energy share would 
require USD 566 million in investment per year. Of this, USD 337 million would come from the REmap Options 
and USD 229 million from investments taking place in the Reference Case.
Lower fossil fuel combustion reduces CO2 emissions by around 8 megatonnes (Mt) per year of CO2 by 2030. 
This amounts to a 23% cut compared to the Reference Case in 2030. These reductions would be an important 
step for the country to realise GHG emission reduction targets in its Nationally Determined Contribution. 
Around 70% of that total mitigation potential comes from the power sector.
Challenges to accelerated renewable energy growth
If renewable energy use is to grow rapidly along the lines suggested in this report, a number of challenges 
need to be overcome. A Consultation with CNE and other stakeholders in the Dominican Republic energy 
sector has identified barriers to rapid growth of renewable energy technologies. The independent power 
system operator, project developers and equipment manufacturers were some of the institutions involved in 
the consultation. These challenges relate specifically to the national circumstances of the Dominican Republic 
today. In the case of the power sector, the main challenges are related to current institutional and regulatory 
framework and whether the required investment can be attractive to realise the REmap Options. In addition, 
there are technical challenges associated with integrating large amounts of variable renewables that have 
to be overcome.
Challenges in the power sector
Institutional and economic challenges
It is important to acknowledge that a long-term vision needs to emerge with intermediate renewable energy 
targets and necessary incentives to realise the potential according to the REmap Options. This means 
maintaining consistency between the national energy plan and national development strategies to bring 
legitimacy.
Strong institutional and regulatory frameworks need to be adopted to provide a stable and attractive 
environment for the required investments. The regulatory framework needs to allow the implementation of 
the changes required in the planning and operational procedures of the power sector, including the electricity 
market. The purpose of these changes should be to integrate a high share of variable renewables.
Technical challenges associated with high share of variable renewables
Generation adequacy and flexibility: to fulfil the potential identified in REmap at least 4 GW of dispatchable 
generation (both renewable and non-renewable) would be required to cover peak power demand in 2030 
in periods of low variable renewable energy generation. Long-term generation expansion plans with 
corresponding intermediate targets will be essential to achieve this condition. They will need to take the 
requirements for flexibility and firm dispatchable generation capacity into consideration. Appropriate 
financial mechanisms are required in order to guarantee that the firm capacity, alongside flexibility services from certain thermal plants, are available when necessary. The financial mechanisms should consider the new 
reduced utilisation conditions imposed by increasing shares wind and solar energy.
Adequate electricity grid development: Santiago and Santo Domingo are the two major load centres. Both 
are at a considerable distance from the rich resource areas of wind in the North, West and Southwest of 
the country. Fulfilling the potential under REmap would require transmission capacity expansion to avoid 
uneconomic wind power curtailment. Planning for this expansion will require co-ordinated action with the 
development of renewable energy capacity targets. Long-term transmission plans and annual operational 
restriction studies may need to incorporate the new renewable energy projects and the evaluation of 
alternative local balancing options. Long-term plans may need to look beyond transmission capacity 
expansion in order to find optimal ways of managing potential congestion in the transmission grid. The 
definition of clearer and attractive rules for financing the connection of new renewable generation and 
required reinforcements in the transmission system should also be considered.
Management of variability and limited predictability of variable renewable power: the operational procedures 
of the power system may need to be reviewed and adapted to the new conditions imposed by the variability 
and limited predictability of variable renewables. The adaptation of the power system operation and the 
corresponding market procedures should be in line with the mid-term generation expansion targets and the 
implementation of new renewable energy projects. Benefiting from advanced forecasting tools to reduce 
system operation costs would require an increased frequency in generation scheduling updates and the use 
of available flexibility options to respond to the updated schedules. Adapting the operational and market 
procedures may mean extending the existing grid codes. At the same time, incentives would be needed 
to implement flexibility options (outside generation), flexible generation and better forecasts of variable 
renewables to make them more predictable.
Management of instantaneous penetration levels for variable renewable power: in the isolated power system 
of the Dominican Republic, very high instantaneous penetration levels of variable renewables can create 
challenges to the security and stability of the electricity supply. This assessment suggests that under REmap,

system security. This assumes current state-of-the art technologies and operational procedures not currently 
implemented in the Dominican Republic. The use of the most up-to-date technologies and operational 
practices in the future may help reduce curtailment to less than 2%. This ratio was calculated taking the 
specific characteristics of SENI into consideration as far as possible but is largely based on parameters in line 
with international experience. Future developments in SENI’s characteristics and economics may change 
these estimates. Hence, there is a need to understand and identify the maximum penetration levels for 
different system configurations. The necessary measures to efficiently manage possible curtailments need 
to be defined in line with the mid- and long-term generation expansion targets.
Challenges in end-use sectors
Buildings: a wide range of renewable heating and cooling technologies exists to replace fossil fuels for 
households, commercial buildings and hotels. Even when externalities are not considered, REmap suggests 
that solar thermal technologies are cost-effective although investment support may be required for lowincome families. There is a need to raise more awareness among consumers of the opportunities offered by 
renewables. For example, the waste generated in the hostelry sector is a valuable resource that can be turned 
into biogas for in-house consumption. Current energy plans overlook this potential in both existing as well 
as expanding building stock.
Industry: this is still the largest renewable energy user in the country to generate process heat. This is due 
the availability of waste and residues utilised for heat generation by the plant owners. There is a further 
potential to supply low- and medium temperature process heat from solar thermal and bioenergy. However, 
to maintain cost competitiveness and security of operation, the fuel supply needs to be affordable and 
continuous. This poses a specific challenge to seasonal residual biomass feedstocks. Solar thermal systems 
will also require additional storage capacity. Moreover, not all industrial plants are designed to be retrofitted 
with solar thermal, which requires advanced planning for space and necessary process modifications.
Transport: this sector consumes the most energy in the Dominican Republic yet national energy plans do 
not consider renewables deployment for the sector. Liquid biofuels could replace gasoline and diesel but 
no market exists. Demand needs to be created by setting targets. Planning for the major potential from the 
sugar industry will also be essential but food security and sustainability concerns will need to be resolved. The 
major potential and reduced externalities (specifically related to air pollution) achievable by implementing 
the various forms of electric mobility identified in REmap need to be considered. Planning is required to work 
out the related infrastructure, how this can be financed and its potential implications for the power sector.
Challenges to bioenergy deployment
Under REmap, bioenergy is a key technology for power generation, heating and transport. However, the 
supply potential and range of arable feedstocks is limited. There is thus a need to prioritise the most resourceefficient and cost-effective uses of bioenergy across different sectors. On the supply side, waste and residues 
will be the key feedstocks as they do not compete with resources required for food production. Efficient and 
environmentally friendly feedstock collection systems will be essential to mobilise their availability. Large 
areas of arable land once used by the sugar cane industry is also available. Provided that sustainability and 
resource concerns are addressed, the potential offered by this land is achievable. Agricultural yields could 
reach the level set by the international best practice, particularly for ethanol production for transport.Policy suggestions
The full REmap Dominican Republic report covers the country’s policy landscape in detail and includes 
specific suggestions by sector. In this summary, these suggestions are outlined for each challenge identified 
in the previous section:
Taking into consideration the vision set in REmap, establish clear and consistent renewable energy targets. 
Ensure they are consistent with other national energy strategies and a stable institutional and regulatory 
framework with the right financial incentives to attract renewables investments.
» Ensure enough dispatchable generation is available to provide the firm capacity and flexibility 
required by the power system. Design appropriate incentives for this purpose supported by updated 
generation expansion plan with intermediate targets.
» Align transmission planning with renewable energy targets and assess the cost and benefits of grid 
expansion and other local balancing measures to efficiently manage possible grid congestion.
» Define measures in line with planning for renewable energy deployment and transmission capacity 
to guarantee economic levels of curtailment. Explore the feasibility of flexibility measures to manage 
it efficiently.
» Devise and introduce appropriate incentives and market mechanisms to promote a flexible power 
system able to deal with the new operational conditions imposed by the expected high share of 
variable renewables.
» Define codes and standards for buildings construction and renovation that consider renewables, such 
as solar water heating and cooling. Integrate renewables into energy and urban planning to accelerate 
its uptake by ensuring cost-effective supply of energy to the population.
» Plan and develop a strategy for renewables use in industry by paying particular attention to the 
technical/ economic design, operational hours and temperature levels of industrial processes.
» Create a market for liquid biofuels in transport and promote electric mobility in congested urban areas 
and touristic parts of the country. This market also needs to make use of synergies with the power 
sector and plan for related infrastructure and financing needs.
» Set targets for bioenergy use in applications lacking any other renewable energy alternative and 
where bioenergy creates added value to the system. Promote the uses of its most resource-efficient 
and cost-effective pathways to ensure sustainability.
This roadmap provides a detailed overview of the realistic potential of renewables in the Dominican Republic 
by 2030. Realising REmap Options by 2030 will require significant efforts to plan the intermediate targets 
and measures to achieve them, particularly in the power sector. The findings of this roadmap thus need 
to be complemented by detailed technical and economic studies focusing on operating and planning the 
interconnected systems containing a high share of variable renewables.
Upon request, IRENA can further support the Dominican Republic government by producing the necessary 
in-depth technical/ economic studies supporting the accelerated deployment of solar and wind power as 
outlined in this analysis.HIGHLIGHTS
● The Dominican Republic’s energy system largely 
relies on fossil fuels imports, which amount to 
around USD 5 billion per annum. This accounts 
for approximately 7% of the country’s gross 
domestic product (GDP) and 90% of its primary 
source of energy.
● The country’s Intended Nationally Determined 
Contribution (INDC) sets an ambitious national 
target to reduce the country’s GHG emissions 
by 25% by 2030 compared to the 2010 level. 
Renewable energy and energy efficiency could 
play an important role in realising these targets.
● Law 57-07 of Renewable Energy Incentives and 
Special Regimes is the country’s main legislative 
instrument promoting renewable energy, 
including a number of measures across all energy 
sectors, particularly the power sector. The law 
set a target of 25% of electricity from renewable 
energy sources by 2025.
● Total demand for energy across the country has 
been growing at about 1% per year for more than 
a decade. Total final energy demand reached 
5 433 ktoe (227 petajoules/PJ) per year by 2014. 
Fossil fuels meet 62% of this demand. Traditional 
and modern forms of bioenergy provide 14%, and 
electricity 24% – of which only 11.5% is renewable 
energy (mainly hydropower). On average, 8.7% 
of the country’s total final energy demand is 
covered by modern renewables.
● The structure of the power sector is the result 
of a reform process that started in the late 
1990s. This process unbundled the activities 
within the power supply chain, enabling private 
sector participation. The Ministry of Energy and 
Mines (MEM), formed in 2013, is responsible 
of formulating and managing energy policies. 
CNE, established in 2001, contributes to national 
energy policy development, including national 
energy planning.
● Total installed renewable electricity generation 
capacity in 2014 reached 795 MW to generate 
2.1 TWh per year of renewable electricity. This 
included 613 MW of hydropower, 85 MW of 
onshore wind, 70 MW of bioenergy and 27 MW 
of solar PV (including autoproducers). About 
two-thirds of planned new generation capacity 
is based on renewable energy, which includes 
588  MW of hydropower plants over 10 MW, 
715 MW of onshore wind, 175 MW of solar PV and 
9 MW of mini-hydropower.
● Compared to the promising developments in the 
power sector, end-use sectors are lagging behind 
in renewable energy deployment. Current use 
of renewable energy is mainly concentrated in 
households in the form of traditional bioenergy 
for water heating and cooking.
● This roadmap shows that the Dominican Republic 
has the potential to raise its renewable energy 
share to 27% by 2030 in the whole energy mix. 
This would result in an annual consumption of 
2 080 ktoe (87 PJ) of final renewable energy in 
that same year. This compares with the share of 
13% if the Dominican Republic merely follows its 
current plans and targets for renewable energy.
● If the potential of technologies in REmap is 
realised, the renewable energy share in the power 
sector reaches 44%. This is significantly higher 
than the 25% target in Law 57-07.
● Total installed capacity of solar PV and onshore 
wind increases to 1.7 and 2.3 GW in 2030 
respectively. Solar PV capacity is split between 
rooftop and utility-scale, and it is expected to be 
located mainly in Santo Domingo and Santiago 
provinces. Wind would be developed in the 
regions with the highest wind potential – the 
northern, southern and eastern provinces.
● In end-use sectors, renewable energy share 
reaches 43% in buildings, 41% in industry and 
5% in transport in 2030. The key renewable energy technology options are bioenergy for 
industry, solar water heaters for buildings and 
a mix of electric mobility (including two- and 
three-wheelers) and biofuels for transport.
● Under REmap, more than 80% of all renewable 
energy technology options could be deployed 
with financial savings when compared with 
the non-renewable technology they replace. 
Savings are also achieved as a result of reduced 
externalities from avoided CO2 and air pollutant 
emissions. When accounting for these, total 
savings reach USD 2.1 billion-5.3 billion per year.
● Total annual average investment needed in 
renewable energy technology deployment 
in 2016-2030 amounts to USD 695 million. 
USD 245 million is required each year to fulfil the 
Reference Case, and an extra USD 450 million per 
year is needed to implement the REmap Options.
● If renewable energy use is to grow rapidly 
along the lines suggested in this report, a 
number of challenges need to be overcome. A 
consultation with CNE and other stakeholders in 
the Dominican Republic energy sector has shed 
light on barriers to rapid growth of renewable 
energy technologies and the challenges ahead. In 
addition, this REmap report has further analysed 
the technical challenges for the integration of 
variable renewable energy technologies in the 
power sector.
● High-level suggestions are provided for dealing 
with the identified challenges, including the 
institutional and regulatory perspective, energy 
planning, technical challenges in the power 
sector, bioenergy market and specific measures 
to promote the use of renewables in end-use 
sectors.1 REMAP PROGRAMME AND REMAP 
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
1.1 IRENA’s REmap programme
REmap aims at paving the way to promote accelerated 
renewable energy development through a series 
of activities, including global, regional and country 
studies. REmap analysis and activity also informs IRENA 
publications on specific renewable technologies or 
energy sectors.
The REmap programme collaborates closely with 
governmental bodies and other institutions responsible 
for energy planning and renewable energy development. 
The analysis relies on broad consultations with energy 
experts and stakeholders from numerous countries 
around the world.
At its inception, REmap emerged as IRENA’s proposal 
for a pathway to support the United Nations’ (UN) 
Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) initiative, in its 
objective to double the global share of renewable 
energy from 18% in 2010 to 36% by 2030 (UN and 
World Bank, 2016). Since then, the 21st Conference of 
the Parties (COP 21) adopted the Paris Agreement in 
2015 with a target to minimise the earth’s temperature 
increase to below 2 degrees Celsius (°C) by 2050. The 
widespread development of renewables is a critical 
lever to fulfilling this objective.
To double the renewable energy share across the world, 
REmap takes a bottom-up approach. Country-level 
assessments are carried out to determine the potential 
contributions that each of them could make to the overall 
renewable energy share. The first global REmap report, 
published in 2014, included a detailed analysis of 26 
major energy-consuming countries representing around 
75% of global energy demand. The REmap programme 
has since expanded to 40 countries accounting for 80% 
of world energy use. The Dominican Republic joined the 
programme in 2015.
The REmap evaluation of the national plans of 
40 countries (which could be considered the businessas-usual case, referred in this study as the reference 
case) suggests that under current conditions and 
policy approaches the global share of renewables only 
increases to 21% by 2030. This indicates a 15 percentagepoint shortfall in relation to the target to double the 
global renewables share by 2030 (IRENA, 2016a). As 
one of the largest energy users in the Caribbean, the 
Dominican Republic plays a critical role in transforming 
the region’s energy consumption.
The Dominican Republic has implemented institutional 
and operational changes in its energy sector, including 
the formation of the Ministry of Energy and Mines 
(MEM) in 2013. One of its mandates is to formulate and 
manage the country’s energy policy. 
Classified by the UN as a Small Island Developing 
State (SIDS), the country faces several economic 
and environmental challenges ranging from climate 
change to high dependency on imported fossil fuels. 
As a consequence, the government and policy makers 
have been directing more attention to the extended 
deployment of renewable energy for electricity 
generation and in direct uses, such as cooling or 
transport. Raising awareness of the socioeconomic, 
environmental, and energy security benefits of 
renewables contributes to this effort. Improving energy 
efficiency and power sector operations are also core 
measures supporting the transition to more sustainable 
and affordable energy in the Dominican Republic.
In January 2016, the government of the Dominican 
Republic represented by the National Energy 
Commission of the Dominican Republic (Comisión 
Nacional de Energía), CNE, requested a REmap study 
from IRENA. Its aim was to explore the potential 
difference renewables could make to achieving the 
country’s energy policy and objectives to 2030 and 
beyond. The government asked IRENA to examine the 
following areas:
(i) Role of renewables for heating, cooling, and 
transport, as well as electrification to provide 
energy services in end-use sectors;(ii) Further potential for increasing the share of 
variable renewables in the power sector;
(iii) Cost and benefits of renewables; and
(iv) Identification of challenges to raising the 
renewables share in the power sector and highlevel suggestions about how to overcome them.
This report presents the detailed REmap analysis carried 
out for the Dominican Republic. REmap elaborates 
on the renewable technology options the country 
could deploy further to raise the renewables share by 
2030. To fulfil this aim, the Dominican Republic has the 
opportunity to extract more out of its wind, solar, and 
biomass potential in particular.
1.2 REmap approach
This section explains the REmap methodology 
and summarises the background data used for the 
Dominican Republic analysis. The annexes provide more 
detailed information.
REmap is a roadmap of technology options to increase 
the global share of renewables. It is a bottom-up, 
iterative analysis. By March 2016, IRENA’s REmap 
programme had assessed the renewables potential of 
40 countries in 2030, which accounts for 80% of total 
global energy demand. These are Argentina, Australia, 
Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Cyprus, 
Denmark, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, 
Ethiopia, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Iran, Italy, 
Japan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, 
Morocco, Nigeria, Poland, Republic of Korea, the Russian 
Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Sweden, Tonga, 
Turkey, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United 
Kingdom, the United States, and Uruguay.
REmap identifies the realistic potential for accelerating 
renewable energy deployment. This can be fulfilled with 
existing technologies and is economically practical and 
achievable by 2030.
It starts by building a country’s energy balance, using 
2010 as the base year built on national data and, in 
the case of the Dominican Republic, CNE statistics. 
To the extent data availability allows, information for 
more recent years (e.g. 2013 and 2014) is provided 
where relevant. The country then provides its latest 
national energy plans and targets for renewables and 
fossil fuels, collated to produce a business-as-usual 
perspective of the energy system. This is referred to as 
the Reference Case. This TFEC for each end-use sector 
(buildings, industry and transport). It distinguishes 
between power, district heating, and direct uses 
of energy6 with a breakdown by energy carrier for 
2010-2030.
Once the Reference Case is ready, the additional 
renewable energy potential by technology is investigated 
for each sector. The potential of these technologies is 
described as REmap Options.7 Each REmap Option 
replaces a non-renewable energy technology8 to deliver 
the same energy service. The resulting case when all 
these options are aggregated is called REmap.
Throughout this study the renewable energy share 
is estimated in relation to TFEC.9 Modern renewable 
energy excludes traditional uses of bioenergy.10 The 
share of modern renewable energy in TFEC is equal to 
total modern renewable energy consumption in end-use 
sectors (including consumption of renewable electricity 
and district heat, and direct uses of renewables), divided 
by TFEC. The share of renewables in power generation is 
also calculated. The renewable energy share can be also 
expressed in terms of the direct uses of renewables only. 
The renewable energy use by end-use sector covers the 
areas described below.
6 Final energy use/consumption from direct uses excludes electricity 
and district heat consumption.
7 An approach based on options rather than scenarios is deliberate. 
REmap 2030 is an exploratory study and not a target-setting 
exercise.
8 Non-renewable technologies encompass fossil fuels, nonsustainable uses of bioenergy (referred to here as traditional 
bioenergy) and nuclear power. As a supplement to this report’s 
annexes, a detailed list of these technologies and related 
background data are provided on the REmap website.
9 TFEC is the energy delivered to consumers as electricity, heat 
or fuels that can be used directly as a source of energy. This 
consumption is usually subdivided into transport, industry, 
residential, commercial and public buildings, and agriculture. It 
excludes non-energy uses of fuels.
10 The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN defines 
traditional biomass use as woodfuels, agricultural by-products, 
and dung burned for cooking and heating purposes.” In developing 
countries, traditional biomass is still widely harvested and used in 
an unsustainable, inefficient and unsafe way. It is mostly traded 
informally and non-commercially. Modern biomass, by contrast, is 
produced in a sustainable manner from solid wastes and residues 
from agriculture and forestry and relies on more efficient methods 
(IEA and World Bank, 2015). ● Buildings include the residential, commercial 
and public sectors. Renewable energy is used in 
direct applications for heating, cooling or cooking 
purposes or as renewable electricity.
● Industry includes the manufacturing and mining 
sectors, in which renewable energy is consumed 
in direct use applications (e.g. process heat or 
refrigeration) and electricity from renewable 
sources.
● Transport sector, which can make direct use of 
renewables through the consumption of liquid 
and gaseous biofuels or through electricity 
generated using renewable energy technologies.
Metrics for assessing REmap Options
To assess the costs of REmap Options, substitution 
costs are calculated. This report also discusses the costs 
and savings of renewable energy (RE) deployment 
and related externalities due to climate change and air 
pollution. Experts devised four main indicators. These 
are substitution costs, system costs, total investment 
needs and needs for renewable energy investment 
support.
Substitution cost
Each renewable and non-renewable technology has 
its own individual cost relative to the non-renewable 
energy it replaces. This is explained in detail in the 
REmap methodology (IRENA, 2014a) and is depicted in 
the following equation:11

This indicator provides a comparable metric for all 
renewable energy technologies identified in each sector. 
Substitution costs are the key indicators for assessing 
the economic viability of REmap Options. They depend 
on the type of conventional technology substituted, 
energy prices and the characteristics of the REmap 
Option. The cost can be positive (additional) or negative 
(savings) because many renewable energy technologies 
are or could by 2030 be more cost-effective than 
conventional technologies.
System costs
On the basis of the substitution cost, inferences can be 
made as to the effect on system costs. This indicator is 
the sum of the differences between the total capital and 
operating expenditures of all energy technologies based 
on their deployment in REmap and the Reference Case 
in 2030.

Investment needs
Investment needs for renewable energy capacity 
can also be assessed. The total investment needs of 
technologies in REmap are higher than in the Reference 
Case due to the increased share of renewables. On 
average, these have greater investment needs than 
12 Substitution cost is the difference between the annualised cost 
of the REmap Option and the annualised cost of the substituted 
non-renewable technology used to produce the same amount 
of energy. This is divided by the total renewable energy use 
substituted by the Remap Option.

The capital investment cost in USD per kilowatt (kW) 
of installed capacity in each year is multiplied with 
the deployment in that year to arrive at total annual 
investment costs. The capital investment costs of each 
year are then added up for the period 2016-2030. 
Net incremental investment needs are the sum of the 
differences between the total investment costs for all 
renewable and non-renewable energy technologies in 
power generation and stationary applications in REmap 
and the Reference Case in the period 2010-2030 for 
each year. This total was then turned into an annual 
average for the period.

Renewable investment support
Renewable investment support needs can also be 
approximated on the basis of the REmap tool. Total 
requirements for renewable investment support in all 
sectors are estimated as the difference in the delivered 
energy service cost (e.g. in USD/kWh or USD/GJ from 
a government perspective) for the renewable option 
against the dominant incumbent in 2030. This difference 
is multiplied by the deployment for that option in that 
year to arrive at an investment support total for that 
technology. The differences for all REmap Options 
are added together to provide an annual investment 
support requirement for renewables. The renewable 
option is not subtracted from the total if it has a 
lower delivered energy service cost than the incumbent 
option. By 2030, this is an increasing trend.

Government and business perspectives
Based on the substitution cost and the potential of 
each REmap Option, country cost-supply curves are 
developed for 2030 from two perspectives: government
and business.
● Government perspective: cost estimates 
exclude energy taxes and subsidies. In the latest 
global REmap study (IRENA, 2016a), a standard 
10% (for non-OECD member countries) or 7.5% 
(for OECD member countries) discount rate was 
used. This approach allows a comparison across 
countries and a country cost-benefit analysis; it 
shows the cost of the transition as governments 
would calculate it.
● Business perspective: this considers national 
prices (including, for example, energy taxes, 
subsidies and the cost of capital) in order to 
generate a localised cost curve. This approach 
shows the cost of the transition as businesses 
or investors would calculate it. A discount rate 
of 12% is assumed in the case of the Dominican 
Republic.
● By estimating the costs from two perspectives, 
the analysis shows the effects of accounting 
for energy taxes and subsidies while all other 
parameters are kept the same. The assessment 
of all additional costs related to complementary 
infrastructure are excluded from this report (e.g. 
grid reinforcements, fuel stations). IRENA analysis 
suggests that these would be of secondary 
importance to countries only just embarking on 
their energy system transformation.
Externality analysis
Several externality reductions obtained through REmap 
Options are considered. They include health effects 
from outdoor or indoor exposure to pollution in the case 
of traditional bioenergy, as well as effects on agricultural 
yields. In addition, the external costs associated with the 
social and economic impacts of carbon dioxide (CO2) 
are estimated (IRENA, 2016b).
Further documentation and a detailed description 
of the REmap methodology can be found at 
www.irena.org/remap. Further details on metrics for assessing REmap Options can be consulted in the 
appendix of the 2016 global report (IRENA, 2016c).
Units
Energy supply and demand numbers in this report are 
generally provided in petajoules (PJ), gigajoules (GJ) 
and terawatt-hour (TWh). In the Dominican Republic, 
commonly used units are tonnes of oil equivalent (toe). 
The relevant conversion factors are listed below:
● 1 GJ = 0.0238 tonnes of oil equivalent (toe)
● 1 GJ = 277.78 kilowatt-hour (kWh)
● 1 PJ = 23.88 kilotonne of oil equivalent (ktoe)
● 1 PJ = 277.78 gigawatt-hour (GWh)
● 1 PJ = 1 000 000 GJ
● 1 ktoe = 1 000 toe
● 1 TWh = 1 000 GWh = 1 000 000 MWh = 
1 000 000 000 kWh
1.3 Main sources of information 
and assumptions in REmap 
Dominican Republic
The main sources and assumptions from background 
data and literature used to prepare REmap Dominican 
Republic are summarised below for each case:
● Base year 2010: the starting point of the analysis 
is Dominican Republic’s energy balances for 
2010. The data are based on the national energy 
balances provided by the Dominican Republic 
government up to the year 2014.14 For the REmap 
analysis, all end-use demand is broken down into 
the following three sectors: industry15, transport 
and buildings.
● Reference Case: this is based on the data 
provided by CNE in its preliminary results of 
energy demand projections for 2013-2030 
prepared in collaboration with Fundación 
Bariloche(CNE, 2014a). For the power sector, 
other data complemented these projections, 
mainly based on estimates provided by CNE.
● REmap: this is based on IRENA’s analysis (details 
of sources and assumptions can be found in 
Chapter 3 and in the annexes) combined with 
the data provided in CNE’s alternative scenario 
(escenario alternativo). This covers a higher 
penetration of certain renewable technologies.
This report is structured as follows: Chapter 2 introduces 
the overall energy and power sector context in the 
Dominican Republic and presents the main renewable 
energy developments so far. Chapter 3 describes the 
renewable energy developments in the Reference Case 
and in REmap. Chapter 4 discusses how the renewable 
energy potential identified in the REmap case could 
be fulfilled. Chapter 5 describes in detail the costs 
and benefits of realising this REmap potential. Finally, 
Chapter 6 includes key recommendations for larger 
renewable energy uptake.
14 Original data expressed in higher heating values (gross calorific 
value) were converted to lower heating values (net calorific value) 
to be consistent with the REmap methodology.
15 The boundaries of REmap analysis typically include agriculture, 
fishery and all primary sector activities in a separate category. 
However, the Dominican Republic aggregates energy demand for 
agriculture with mining and construction sectors so all these have 
been included in the energy consumption of industry.2.1 Renewable energy drivers
The Dominican Republic is one of the largest and most 
diverse economies in the Caribbean region. Its Intended 
Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) sets an 
ambitious national target to reduce its GHG emissions 
by 25% by 2030 compared to the 2010 per capita 
level of 3.6 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) (UNFCCC, 
2015). Reaching this target depends on whether the 
Dominican Republic can wean itself off unsustainable 
energy sources. It currently relies on expensive fossil 
fuel imports while demand for energy is growing rapidly. 
There is no doubt that improvements in infrastructure 
will be required in the years ahead to meet the country’s 
growing energy demand.
Fossil fuel imports now amount to around USD 5 billion 
per annum, which accounts for approximately 7% of 
country’s GDP. Fossil fuel imports account for 90% 
of the country’s primary source of energy (Central 
Bank of the Dominican Republic, 2016; Killeen, 2015). 
Electricity generation is very much dependent on fossil 
fuel imports so operating costs are high. Oil products, 
natural gas and coal account for about 50%, 27% and 
15% of electricity generation respectively (CNE, 2016a). 
The high cost of electricity production is not reflected in 
the electricity tariffs because government-led pre-tax 
subsidies, amounting to USD 1 billion per annum, help 
keep tariffs relatively low. These subsidies account for 
about 2% of the Dominican Republic’s GDP.16 About 0.1% 
is applied to the fuels while the remaining 1.9% is directly 
applied to the electricity tariffs (Di Bella et al., 2015).
Diversifying the electricity generation portfolio could 
be key to reducing the country’s dependence on fuel 
imports and improving its energy supply security in light 
of its growing energy demand. It would be decarbonising 
16 Fuel tax exemption for the fuel used for power generation is not 
included in the public budget.
the economy at the same time. Renewable energy 
technologies offer a cost-effective path for the 
future. Wind and solar resources are abundant in the 
Dominican Republic. According to several estimates, 
wind power potential is around 30 GW while solar 
potential is similar to the southwestern US. The 
average global horizontal irradiance (GHI) amounts to 
5-7 kWh per square metre per day (kWh/m2/day), and in 
some regions this can rise to 8 kWh/m2/day (Worldwatch 
Institute, 2015). Renewable energy technologies can 
also play an important role in providing electricity to the 
low share of households which lack access so far. This is 
less than 5% of the total (Cruz Castillo, 2014).
The Dominican Republic government has demonstrated 
its commitment towards renewable energy technologies, 
particularly for the power sector. Article 21 of Law 
57-07, enacted in 2007, set a non-binding target of 
10% and 25% of electricity consumed in 2015 and 2025 
respectively to be supplied from renewable energy 
sources. This would imply that 25% of the electricity 
purchased by the distribution and retail companies 
should be sourced from renewable energy. Since not 
enough renewable power generation was available to 
meet the ambitious 2015 goal, the country is committed 
to increase its efforts to set itself on the path to meet 
the 2025 target. This REmap study prepared in close 
collaboration with CNE is one of the tasks aimed at 
achieving this goal.
2.2 Renewable energy policies
The main legislative instrument promoting renewable 
energy in the Dominican Republic is Law 57-07 on 
Renewable Energy Incentives and Special Regimes, 
enacted in 2007. This includes some provisions for 
renewable energy technologies across all energy 
sectors, particularly the power sector.
2 CURRENT PICTURE – ENERGY AND 
RENEWABLES DEVELOPMENT IN THE 
DOMINICAN REPUBLICA number of measures are included in Law 57-07. It 
provides a broad range of tax incentives, including a 
100% exemption for renewable energy technologies 
from import taxes and taxes on the Transfer of 
Industrialised Goods and Services17. It also gives a tax 
reduction on external financing and a 40% tax credit to 
autoproducers, which are defined as systems smaller 
than 1.5 MW.18 In addition, it enables low interest loans 
for community projects, which cover up to 75% of the 
cost of equipment for small-scale installations (less than 
500 kW). Finally, the law establishes a reference tariff for 
the remuneration of grid-connected renewable energy 
installations and sets the basis to have a remuneration 
scheme for the excess energy of autoproducers. 
The law is supplemented by the Regulation for the 
Implementation of the Renewable Energy Incentives 
and Special Regimes Law, enacted on 2008. More 
details on the law are provided in the description of the 
institutional and regulatory framework in section 2.3.
In addition to the renewable energy law, a net-metering 
programme was devised in 2011 for residential 
wind or solar PV installations (the latter applicable 
to installations smaller than 25 kW and commercial 
facilities under 1 MW). This makes them eligible to 
receive credits for excess power exported to the grid. 
Under this programme, 1 002 customers had connected 
21.3 MW of solar PV to the grid by December 2015 (CNE, 
2016b).
The use of renewable energy technologies for electricity 
generation has also expanded through energy access 
efforts. In 2009, the government launched a rural 
electrification programme with renewable energy 
sources that was operational during four years. Small 
hydropower and PV installations were deployed for 
off-grid electrification (SE4All, n.d). Some of these were 
run by CNE, which is subject to a government goal to 
install 500 PV systems in households not connected 
to the grid. The grid has also been extended in certain 
places throughout the Dominican Republic. The national 
level of electrification is now around 96%, and around 
120 000 (CNE, 2014a) households lack electricity access. 
Nearly all of these are in rural areas, and only a minimal 
number are in suburban zones.
17 Impuesto sobre Transferencia de Bienes Industrializados y Servicios
(ITBIS).
18 This rate applicable today had been previously modified by Law 
253-12 (law to reinforce the tax collection capacity of the State for 
Fiscal sustainability and sustainable development).
2.3 Recent trends in total final 
energy consumption
The average total final energy demand of the Dominican 
Republic has grown by 1% per year between 2000 
and 2014, reaching 227 PJ (5 433 ktoe). The growth 
was notable in the industry, commercial and services 
sector, whose annual growth rate rose to almost 3% 
per year over the period. By comparison, transport 
sector demand has remained about the same with a 
slight decline. Residential sector demand increased by 
approximately 1% per year (CNE, 2014b).
Transport is the largest consumer of final energy, 
representing 40% of the country’s total energy demand 
in 2014. This is followed by buildings, which accounted 
for a third of total final energy use in that year. Finally, 
industry demand accounted for a quarter of the total. 
Agriculture and fisheries also use energy, especially 
for pumps and transport but this is less than 3% of the 
country’s total energy demand. (CNE, 2014b)
In 2014, about 62% of the country’s total final energy 
demand was supplied by fossil fuels, mostly in the form 
of oil products, while electricity accounted for 24% of 
final energy use. Direct uses of renewables reached 
around 14% (mostly from wood fuel for cooking and 
water heating in the residential sector, and bagasse for 
process heat in the industry sector) (CNE, 2014b).
In terms of total primary energy supply, the country 
reached 8 219 ktoe (344 PJ) in 2014. Since most energy 
needs are covered by fossil fuels, and the country lacks 
local fossil resources, more than 90% of the country’s 
total primary energy supply is based on imports.
Peak electricity demand reached 2.63 GW in 2015, 
and about a quarter of the total final energy demand 
is related to electricity. This rate is higher than the 
average in the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean. 
However, consumption across the various regions 
of the country varies significantly. For example, per 
capita consumption in Punta Cana – one of the touristic 
regions – differs from the rest of the country by almost 
a factor of ten. The difference is higher when compared 
with the demand of the population in isolated areas.
Industry has an exceptionally high ratio of electricity 
use to total energy consumption, amounting to 38% in 
2014. By contrast, the share is less than 1% in transport – the lowest consumer of all sectors (CNE, 2014b). 
Within the buildings sector these proportions differ 
greatly. In the residential sector, the share amounts 
to around 30% whereas the commercial and services 
sector has a share of more than 80%. The potential for 
increasing electrification rates in some of these sectors 
is an important factor when considering the further 
deployment of renewable electricity.

Dominican Republic’s TFEC amounted to 8.7% in 2014, 
as shown in Figure 3 (if traditional uses of bioenergy 
are included, this increases to 16.3%5) (CNE, 2014b). 
The largest contributors are biomass in the residential 
and industry sectors while solar thermal energy in 
buildings and liquid biofuels in transport make a very 
small contribution. Most renewable energy consumed 
is used for heating in industry and buildings. A low 
share of renewable energy use corresponds to energy 
consumed through renewable electricity coming mostly 
from hydropower.
The industry sector has the greatest renewable energy 
share of all sectors at 21% (including electricity sourced 
from renewables). If electricity consumption is excluded, 
27% of renewable energy consumption arises from the 
direct use of fuels in the industry sector, all based on 
bioenergy.
The power sector has the second highest share of 
renewable energy in the Dominican Republic. 
Renewable energy technologies accounted for 12% of 
total electricity generation in 2014, mostly based on 
hydropower.
The buildings sector meets 8% of its direct fuel demand 
from modern renewable energy; if traditional uses of 
bioenergy are included, this share rises to 48%. This is 
mostly bioenergy with a minor contribution from solar 
thermal. Around 9% of total sector energy demand 
(including electricity) is met with modern renewables.
Transport has the lowest share at just 0.1%, coming 
entirely from biodiesel in 2014.
2.4 Power sector
In 2014, electricity accounted for nearly a quarter of the 
Dominican Republic’s TFEC. About 10% of the electricity 
was generated with renewable energy technologies 
(including hydropower plants over 5 MW). The share 
of renewable energy in the power sector is likely to 
increase, and every day its deployment is attracting 
more attention from the national policy makers.

Note: the share of renewable energy in end-use sectors includes electricity from renewable sources.The following sections briefly describe the institutional 
and regulatory framework as well as roles and activities 
of the main stakeholders within the power sector in the 
Dominican Republic. These sections are descriptive and 
aim to facilitate the understanding of the local context.
Institutional and regulatory framework
The structure of the power sector in the Dominican 
Republic is the result of a reform process that 
started in the late 1990s. Until then, the stateowned Dominican Electric Company (Corporación 
Dominicana de Electricidad) (CDE) was in charge of 
electricity generation, transmission, distribution and 
retail. Only a few private companies participated in 
the generation business through Power Purchase 
Agreements (PPAs).
A general reform in state-owned companies was 
implemented through the enactment of Law 141-97 on 
the Reform of Public Enterprises adopted in June 1997, 
which sets the basis for allowing private companies to 
participate in power sector activities. Later, the general 
electricity Law 125-01 adopted in July 2001 and its 
application rules defined the regulatory framework for 
the activities in the power sector. The reform aimed to 
address issues related to high electricity costs, tariffs 
driven by political interests, non-delivered electricity 
and operational inefficiency (CNE, 2008). As part 
of this process, the MEM was created in 2013. The 
aim was to formulate and manage policies for the 
entire exploitation of the national energy and mining 
resources under the principles of transparency and 
sustainability. The reform process unbundled activities 
within the power supply chain, enabling private sector 
participation and producing the following set-up:
● Generation activity is structured within a 
competitive wholesale market (mercado eléctrico 
mayorista) with participation from privately 
owned and public-private partnership generation 
companies.
● The transmission grid, hydropower generation 
and most of the distribution system assets
remain under the ownership of the Dominican 
Republic government.
● Three distribution concessions have been 
granted to three different state-owned 
companies, which deliver the electricity to the 
consumers connected at distribution level. The 
same companies are in charge of the electricity 
retail activities for their regulated customers.

Based on CNE (2014b) data● Through CNE, the government is in charge of 
preparing indicative long-term planning of 
the generation, transmission and distribution
systems. The indicative planning aims to 
provide appropriate signals to stakeholders in 
order to promote adequate investments in and 
development of the sector.
● Operation of the interconnected power system
– the operation of the National Interconnected 
Electrical System (Sistema Eléctrico Nacional 
Interconectado), SENI – is planned and coordinated by the independent co-ordination 
entity OC-SENI. It also administers the 
transactions in the wholesale power market.
● Real-time operation of the national 
interconnected system, SENI, is carried out by 
the Energy Control Centre (Centro de Control 
de Energía) (CCE), a division of the Dominican 
Electric Transmission Company (Empresa de 
Transmisión Eléctrica Dominicana) ETED, in coordination with OC-SENI.
● Energy transactions in the wholesale electricity 
market are made through over-the-counter 
long-term contracts between producers and 
large consumers (i.e. distribution companies and 
non-regulated consumers) or through the spot 
market.
Law 57-07 and its application rules defined the 
regulatory framework to promote investment and 
generation of energy with renewable sources, including 
provisions for power sector technologies. The law set 
a target for a renewable power share of 10% and 25% 
of total electricity produced in the Dominican Republic 
by 2015 and 2025 respectively. However, this target is 
not binding but does demonstrate the government’s 
commitment to renewable energy technologies.
As stated above, Law 57-07 also defined a special regime 
for renewable energy production, aiming to foster its 
deployment across the country. The grid-connected 
renewable energy installations in this regime (plantas 
de régimen especial) have the right to a ten-year feed-in 
tariff until 2018, which adds a premium payment to the 
wholesale electricity price. The feed-in tariff incentive 
levels (defined in US dollars but paid in Dominican 
pesos) are differentiated by technology and system size. 
Autoproducers also have the right to be paid for their 
excess generation at a regulated price.
Five types of power plants are currently subject to this 
special regime. They include: 1) wind power installations 
with an initial installed capacity of less than 50 MW; 
2) hydropower installations of less than 5 MW; 3) all 
types and sizes of solar PV as well as 4) concentrated 
solar power (CSP) systems lower than 120 MW; and 5) 
power plants using bioenergy as main fuel for at least 
60% of their fuel supply and with a maximum installed 
capacity of 80 MW. The installation size limits applicable 
for some technologies can be duplicated provided that 
the projects have been developed at least at 50% of the 
initial planned capacity. The details of plant size limits 
and possible project expansion are described in Article 
5 of the renewable energy Law 57-07.
In addition to this incentive, favourable conditions 
encourage system entry and market participation, 
namely priority of interconnection and dispatch, and 
fiscal incentives. These are described in section 2.1 as 
part of renewable energy policies.
Besides the legislation and main regulatory conditions, 
a set of technical rules developed by CNE, the Electricity 
Superintendency (Superintendencia de Electricidad) 
(SIE) and OC-SENI are enforced to allow the secure 
and efficient operation of the interconnected system. 
These technical rules include the connection code for 
generators, distribution systems and non-regulated 
consumers and the rules for the connection of 
distributed generation19.
Figure 5 summarises the timeline for the main 
institutional and legislation changes in the power sector 
of the Dominican Republic up to 2011.20
Main actors and activities in the power sector
The main stakeholders within the institutional framework 
of the power sector in the Dominican Republic include 
(CNE, n.d.):
19 Or Reglamento para la Interconexión de la Generación Distribuida 
in Spanish.
20 After this year no other major legislation or reform has been 
implemented, apart from some adjustments to the existing 
regulation.● Ministry of Energy and Mines – MEM: this was 
created by Law 100-13 adopted in July 2013. MEM 
is in charge of the energy and mines sector and 
responsible for developing the related energy 
policies.
● National Energy Commission – CNE: this was 
created by Law 125-01 in 2001. Amongst its 
other functions, the commission contributes to 
national energy policy development. For this 
purpose, CNE develops and updates a national 
energy plan. It is CNE’s responsibility to promote 
investments according to the strategies defined 
by the plan. In the power sector, CNE is in charge 
of the development and update of long-term 
indicative (non-binding) expansion plans for 
the generation, transmission and distribution 
systems. It also administers Law 57-07 to 
promote the investment of renewable energy 
technologies.
● Electricity Superintendency (Superintendencia 
de Electricidad) – SIE: Created through Law 
125-01 in 2001, it is the regulatory body in charge 
of the economic and technical norms related to 
the generation, transmission, distribution and 
retail of electricity.
● SENI Co-ordination Unit (Organismo 
Coordinador del Sistema Eléctrico Nacional 
Interconectado) – OC-SENI: formally established 
through Law 125-01 in 2001, OC-SENI plans and 
co-ordinates the operation of the interconnected 
system as well as co-ordinating and supervising 
commercial transactions between agents in the 
wholesale power market.
● Dominican Corporation of Public Electrical 
Companies (Corporación Dominicana de 
Empresas Eléctricas Estatales) – CDEEE: 
this is the umbrella company responsible for 
co-ordinating the strategies, objectives and 
actions of all the electricity companies owned 
or controlled by the government. Additionally, 
CDEEE is responsible for the government’s 
rural electrification programmes and the 
administration of existing PPAs with independent 
power producers.
● Dominican Electric Transmission Company 
(Empresa de Transmisión Eléctrica 
Dominicana) – ETED: ETED is the state-owned 
company responsible for operating, maintaining 
and administering the high-voltage transmission 
network (345-69 kilovolts – kV).

Note: each of the agents in the figure above are described below.● Distribution companies – EDENORTE, EDESUR 
and EDEESTE: the distribution of electricity 
within SENI is carried out by three state-owned 
companies which administer three different 
concessions across the national territory, as 
shown in Figure 13. The distribution companies 
also control the retail of electricity for regulated 
customers.
● Generation companies: as of December 2014, 
16 power generation companies were associated 
with OC-SENI. All the major hydropower 
generation assets belong to the state-owned 
Dominican Hydroelectric Generation Corporation 
(Empresa de Generación Hidroeléctrica 
Dominicana) (EGEHID). Two independent power 
producers, Compañía de Electricidad de San 
Pedro de Macorís and Generadora San Felipe, 
deliver power under PPAs administered by 
CDEEE. The remaining 13 companies own the 
thermal power plants and participate with the 
Dominican Hydroelectric Generation Corporation, 
EGEHID, in the wholesale market through energy 
and power transactions.
● Consumers: these are classified as regulated 
or non-regulated. Regulated consumers are 
represented in the wholesale market by the

regulated consumers is carried out by the 
distribution companies according to the tariff 
regime and rules established by the regulator, 
SIE. Consumers with demand of more than 1 MW 
can cover their electricity needs through direct 
transactions with generators in the wholesale 
market.
● Figure 6 summarises the roles and the interactions 
between these agents of the power sector of the 
Dominican Republic and the following sections 
describe the activities carried out by them. 
Before describing the activities, a brief discussion 
is presented on electricity demand to provide the 
context.
Electricity and power demand
Demand for electricity reached 15 TWh in 2014, with 
annual generation approaching 18 TWh in the same 
year (including autoproduction). Roughly 40% of this 
total is used in the industry sector. The remaining 
60% is consumed in buildings and is split into 35% for 
residential and 25% for commercial buildings. Demand 
for electricity has grown by 7% per year on average in 
the past decade.
The power demand profile changes according to days 
of the week and climate conditions. Typically, peak 
demand for power occurs in the evenings during the 
warmer months of the year. In 2015, the peak demand 
of the interconnected system reached 2.63 GW (OCSENI, 2015a).21 Figure 8 shows significant values for the 
demand profiles in 2015. The orange curve shows the 
percentile 99 of the demand profile for 2015, the blue 
one shows the percentile 1 and the grey curve shows 
the average.22
21 This figure includes projections of power demand not delivered 
due to programmed customer disconnections.

Based on IEA (2015)Generation
The total installed generation capacity in the country, 
including autoproducers and off-grid installations, was 
4.9 GW in 2014 (CNE, 2016c, 2014b; CNE and Fundación 
Bariloche, 2014; IRENA, 2016d). SENI contributed 
about 3.7 GW to this total. The evolution of generation 
capacity for SENI is presented in Figure 9. The annual 
average growth of installed capacity within SENI in the 
last five years has been around 5.2% (OC-SENI, 2014a).
As shown in the figure, the growth in installed capacity 
in SENI in the last few years has been dominated 
by internal combustion engine technologies. Most of 
these power plants can be operated with both oil 
products and natural gas. Due to lower fuel prices, 
internal combustion engine generators were up until 
2015 operated with oil products, mainly fuel oil and 
diesel.
Currently, 65% of the generation capacity within SENI is 
owned and operated by private companies. The largest 
market participant in terms of installed capacity is the 
privately owned AES Dominicana, with a share of 21% 
(815 MW). All the major hydropower generation assets, 
with a share of 16% of the total installed capacity, belong 
to the state-owned hydropower company EGEHID. 
Public-private partnerships such as Haina and Itabo 
own also significant shares of the installed capacity 
(CNE, 2015).
Of the 18 TWh of electricity generated in 2014, 14.3 TWh 
(about 79% of the total) was produced within SENI (OCSENI, 2014a). Oil products make up the largest share of 
fuel in electricity production within SENI, amounting to 
45.6%.23 Natural gas and coal accounted for 28.5% and 
15.4% of the total respectively. Renewable resources 
had a share of 8.8% and 1.7% for hydropower and wind 
power respectively (OC-SENI, 2014a). Figure 10 shows 
the breakdown of electricity generation in SENI by 
fuel type for 2010-2014. The variability in hydropower 
production is explained by the effects of the El NiñoSouthern Oscillation phenomenon which periodically 
affects the rainfall in the country.
In response to the fast growing demand, several new 
generation projects have been planned and received 
a development concession from the government. 
23 A number of dual fuel power plants exist in the country. These can 
either use liquefied natural gas or oil. The generation from these 
power plants was aggregated according to the fuel consumption 
breakdown of each plant provided by SENI (OC-SENI, n.d).

Based on OC-SENI (2015b)Given that construction has not yet started on all the 
projects with final concessions, it cannot be said that 
all this planned capacity will be realised. However, this 
still reflects the interest in expanding the generation 
capacity. The combined capacity of the projects with 
a final concession totals 2 385 MW (CNE, 2016c, 2015,

Based on OC-SENI (2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014a) datap. 16). About a quarter of this capacity is expected to 
be developed by state-owned companies, and 64% 
corresponds to renewable energy technologies, with 
wind, large hydropower and solar PV having the largest 
share. Table 1 provides an overview of the projects with 
final concession.
Transmission
ETED is responsible for operating and maintaining 
the high-voltage transmission grid in the SENI. Up to 
2014, more than 85% of total electricity demand in the 
Dominican Republic was met through SENI based on 
the ETED transmission network. Table 3 provides details 
about the existing infrastructure.
The transmission system mainly has a radial configuration 
in the most remote zones in the North, South and East 
of the country. These zones are connected with each 
other at 138 kV and 69 kV. The two main electricity 
consumption centres, Santo Domingo and Santiago, are 
supplied through 138 kV rings and are interconnected 
through 345 kV and 138 kV circuits.
For planning operations, the system is divided into 
four areas: Central, East, South and North. A diagram 
of the transmission system and its operational areas 
and sub-areas is provided in Figure 11. The Central area, 
which includes the capital city Santo Domingo, has 
the greatest power demand. Its peak load represents 
around 47% of the national peak load. This is followed by

MVA – megavolt amperesthe security limits for transferring power between the 
systems’ areas and sub-areas. The mid-term analysis is 
based on the present system topology. The long-term 
analysis includes transmission projects expected for 
the time horizon of the study according to existing 
Transmission Expansion Plans. The limits for maximum 
power transfer between operational areas according to 
the latest study are summarised in Table 3.
In 2014, there were 51 hours of congestion in the 
transmission system mainly related to scheduled 
maintenance works. After taking into consideration 
existing restrictions, planned generation projects and 
power demand growth forecasts in each area, ETED 
worked out a master plan for expanding the transmission 
system for 2013-2020 (ETED, 2013). That plan is currently 
under implementation. The main expansion projects are 
in the North area and summarised in the table below. 
The order of implementation is defined according to 
system needs and priorities identified by OC-SENI and 
ETED. Interconnections with the neighbouring country 
of Haiti are not planned for the moment.
The transmission infrastructure and ETED operation are 
financed through a regulated transmission fee. ETED is 
obliged by law to allow third-party access (generators, 
major consumers and distributors) to its high-voltage 
network. According to the current regulation, the 
generator initially bears the costs of connecting new 
generation and the corresponding reinforcements 
required in the existing grid. ETED compensates for 
these generator costs throughout the lifetime of the 
project.
Distribution
As of 2014, around 78% of all electricity demand in 
the country was distributed by the three state-owned

Based on ETED (2013) dataEDENORTE and EDEESTE have been distributing fairly 
equal amounts of electricity in recent years. In 2014, 
each supplied around 4 TWh of electricity. The National 
District and Santo Domingo province, which accounts 
for the most demand in the Dominican Republic, is 
supplied by EDESUR (for the municipalities of Santo 
Domingo West) and EDEESTE (for the municipality of 
Santo Domingo North and East). EDENORTE, EDEESTE 
and EDESUR are also in charge of the electricity retail 
for regulated costumers in their jurisdictions. Figure 14 
shows the evolution of annual electricity distributed by 
the three main distribution companies for 2009-2013. 
Delivered electricity in each jurisdiction in Figure 14 does 
not correspond exactly to electricity demand because 
some of it has not been supplied due to programmed 
disconnections.
The high electricity losses at the distribution level 
explain one of the challenges faced by the Dominican 
Republic power sector. As reforms were introduced, the 
three main distribution companies were acquired by 
foreign electricity firms. In 2000-2010, the government 
repurchased the shares of the three companies due to 
financial difficulties associated with tariff collection and 
high levels of non-technical losses.
According to CDEEE estimates, the total annual losses 
in the distribution system are around 35.9% of the

Based on CDEEE and EDEs (2015) dataelectricity purchased by the EDEs. This value includes 
electricity purchased by the distribution companies but 
not billed, as well as billed electricity with an uncollected 
tariff. Total losses in the Dominican Republic are well 
above regional levels, as in other countries these are 
around 15% (CDEEE and EDEs, 2015).
The majority of losses at distribution level are nontechnical. This has affected the capacity of the 
distribution companies to recover their operational 
costs through tariffs. This situation poses a risk to 
the long-term future of the country’s entire power 
supply chain and has resulted in a number of supply 
interruptions.
Figure 15 shows a breakdown of total distributed 
electricity for 2009-2013 with a breakdown of tariffs 
collected and uncollected as well as the volume of 
losses. The share of collected electricity has been 
increasing. The distribution company losses have 
decreased slightly. In addition, uncollected electricity 
has shown a slight fall over the same period.
Independent system operation
OC-SENI is in charge of planning and co-ordinating 
the operation of the interconnected system in the 
Dominican Republic. The operation aims to deliver 
electricity at a minimal economic cost, fulfilling the 
reliability and quality criteria set in the regulation. The 
process involves five stages with different time horizons:
● Long-term operation planning (four years ahead, 
updated every year)
● Outage scheduling for major maintenances (one 
year ahead, updated every year)
● Mid-term operation planning (one year ahead, 
updated every month)
● Short-term operation planning (generation 
scheduling, day and week ahead)
● Redispatch of daily operation in co-ordination 
with the real-time operator (intraday)
The long- and mid-term operational plans assess 
the availability of generation resources to guarantee

Losses Collected Uncollected
Based on CDEEE and EDEs (2015) dataenough power and energy to cover demand at 
minimum operational costs in the corresponding time 
horizons. Additionally, OC-SENI makes annual updates 
of the assessment of the transmission capacity in coordination with ETED. They identify secure limits for 
the transfer of power between the different operational 
areas of the transmission system.
The long- and mid-term plan results, as well as the 
updated information on network restrictions, power 
plant availability and operational costs, are used by OCSENI for weekly and day-ahead generation scheduling. 
Generation is scheduled on a merit order basis with 
hourly resolution. This means the bids of available 
thermal plants with the lowest-declared variable 
operational costs are used to cover forecast hourly 
demand.24 The resulting hourly marginal cost, the 
marginal short-term cost of energy, is used to value 
energy transactions in the spot market.
Renewable energy resources included in the special 
regime of Law 57-07, as well as run-of-river hydropower 
plants, take priority in the merit order. They are 
dispatched according to their declared availability. 
Hydropower plants with reservoir regulation are 
scheduled by OC-SENI according to the available 
weekly energy declared by EGEHID. According to 
current regulation, OC-SENI aims to use the available 
energy from the hydropower reservoirs during peak 
hours or when they can provide operational reserves or 
security-constrained generation. The operational costs 
of hydropower reservoirs are assumed at zero.
Due to security constraints in the system, out-of-merit 
order generation can be scheduled by OC-SENI. In these 
cases, generation is compensated with the declared 
variable operational costs as long as it is below the 
indexed price cap (costo marginal tope) defined by 
the regulator SIE. In December 2015, the indexed price 
cap stood at USD 93.56 per megawatt-hour (MWh) 
(OC-SENI, 2016).
During real-time operation, the day-ahead programme 
is rescheduled in case of grid contingencies or major 
deviations from forecast generation or demand. 
24 Hydropower availability is declared weekly by EGEHID, and power 
is dispatched by OC-SENI to minimise operational costs according 
to available energy.
This includes generation outages or changes in the 
availability of special regime or run-of-river renewable 
generators.
Currently 3% of expected scheduled generation is 
allocated for primary and 3% for secondary reserves. 
Unless previously agreed, all the units in SENI are 
obliged to provide primary reserve services. Secondary 
reserve is provided only by selected units.
Wholesale power market
Electricity in the Dominican Republic interconnected 
system is traded between generators and large 
consumers through the wholesale power market. Large 
consumers include the non-regulated users and the 
distribution companies. Electricity is traded through 
long-term bilateral contracts or the spot market.
The amount, price and conditions of the long-term 
contracts are bilaterally agreed between generators 
and consumers. The spot market settles differences 
between contracted, produced (according to merit 
order) and consumed electricity. According to present 
regulation, at least 20% of total energy must be traded 
through the spot market.
Figure 16 shows a breakdown of the amount of the 
electricity taken by distribution companies, nonregulated consumers connected at transmission level 
and losses in the transmission network. Figure 17 shows 
monthly energy traded through long-term contracts 
and spot market in 2014.
Figure 18 shows the monthly average price paid by the 
EDEs for an energy unit in 2014-2015. According to 
Martínez (2013), major factors influencing spot market 
behaviour include availability of thermal units, fuel 
costs, long-term contract prices, demand evolution, 
reservoir levels and water inflows.
Generators in the market are also remunerated for 
the firm power generation capacity they provide to 
the system. This is done through power transactions 
(transacciones de potencia) in proportion to firm 
power the generators can contribute to cover peak 
demand every month. As of 2014, the monthly payment 
for firm power was around USD 8.6/kW (OC-SENI, 
2015d). According to the definition in Law 57-07 and 
its application rules, non-dispatchable renewable Figure 16: Annual energy measured by SENI for selected years (2002-2014)

Off-grid systems25
There are seven large off-grid systems in the Dominican 
Republic (see Table 6). These are mainly located 
in touristic areas. Most are owned and operated 
25
by private companies. Total installed generation 
capacity in the isolated areas is around 270 MW at 
the moment – close to 6% of the country’s installed 
capacity. The net electricity generated in these seven 
areas is estimated at around 1 TWh, representing 
approximately 7% of total national demand. Table 6 
provides basic information about the largest off-grid 
systems in the whole country:

Source: CNE (2016d)The off-grid system in the touristic area of Punta Cana, 
owned by the private company CEPM, is the largest in 
the country. The total installed capacity, mainly fossil 
fuels (heavy and light fuel oil), is around 181 MW, and 
annual electricity generation close to 855 GWh. CEPM 
provides electricity from its own generation resources 
and through a PPA with EGEHAIANA which injects 
power from the Sultana del Este power plant through a 
dedicated transmission line.
2.5 Current renewable energy 
status by sector
Renewable energy in the power sector
In 2014, total renewable generation installed capacity 
amounted to 795 MW. The installed renewable capacity 
in SENI was 717 MW – about 19.2 % of the total installed 
capacity in SENI. This included 613 MW of hydropower 
(66 MW of small-scale plants with capacity below 
10 MW), 85 MW of onshore wind, 27 MW of solar PV 
(including autoproducers) and 70 MW of bioenergy 
(including residues and waste) (CNE, 2016c; IRENA, 
2016d; Worldwatch Institute, 2011).
In the course of January to July 2016, 50 MW of wind 
power (Larimar I) and 30 MW of solar PV (Monte 
Plata) have been commissioned. In addition, 30 MW of 
bagasse cogeneration is expected to be online by the 
end of 2016.
According to projects with a final concession (see Table 
1), about two-thirds of generation expansion capacity 
is based on renewable energy resources. The planned 
projects include 588 MW of hydropower plants over 
10 MW, 715 MW of onshore wind, 175 MW of solar PV and 
9 MW of mini-hydropower (CNE, 2016c, forthcoming).
As previously discussed, renewable energy resources 
have priority in the order of dispatch determining 
the power system daily operation. The use of these 
resources for power generation thus mainly depends 
on their availability. In 2015, electricity generated from 
renewable resources in SENI was 1 217 GWh, representing 
8.1% of the SENI total. Despite the increase in both total 
installed capacity and wind power production, the total 
share of renewables has not grown constantly over the 
last four years (see Figure 19). This has been attributed 
to the severe droughts of 2014 and 2015 (El Dinero, 
2015).

Based on OC-SENI data (2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014a, 2015a)As shown in Figure 20, electricity generation from 
hydropower plants has decreased considerably over the 
last two years. While electricity production has fallen, 
installed capacity has increased from 2011 to 2015.. This 
is mainly due to 90 MW commissioned from the Tavera, 
Valdesia and Palomino plants in 2012.
Figure 21 presents the statistics for the monthly 
incoming flow of five of the country’s main dams (ACQ 
y Asociados, n.d.) and the hydropower figures reported 
by OC-SENI (OC-SENI, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 
2013, 2014a, 2015a). These were used to observe the 
seasonality of the hydropower resource availability and 
operation. The blue bars show the incoming flow times 
in relation to the annual average with a 99% confidence 
level while the red line shows the average monthly 
capacity factor in 2008-2014.
In 2010, there were 26 small hydropower plants of less 
than 5 MW with a total capacity of 15.4 MW. More than 
nine micro-hydropower plants have been built within 
the past two years, benefiting more than 4 000 families 
and ten schools. In total, more than 15 300 people 
benefited from this, and 665 kW micro-hydropower 
plants were have been installed (Liu et al., 2013)
Installed wind power capacity is currently 135 MW 
(as of mid-2016). It consists of four power plants: Los 
Cocos I and II, Quilvio Cabrera and Larimar I, the plant 
commissioned in 2016 (CNE, 2016c; IRENA, 2016d). All 
the existing wind power plants are in the southwest of 
the country (CNE, forthcoming). Figure 22 details the 
evolution of installed wind power capacity and annual 
wind power generation in the Dominican Republic. 
In 2015, total wind power generation was 284 GWh, 
representing 1.9% of total electricity production in SENI 
(OC-SENI, 2015a). The annual average capacity factor 
has amounted to around 34% over the last three years 
of operation (OC-SENI, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014a, 
2015a).
Figure 23 shows operational seasonality over the last 
few years (2012-2014) of the main renewable energy 
resources, wind and hydropower. The wind capacity 
factors are over 30% most of the months and at their 
maximum in December- January and June-July.

Based on OC-SENI data (2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014a, 2015a)However, a steep decline can be observed in SeptemberOctober. The hydropower capacity factor and resource 
availability experiences one of its peaks during this 
period of low wind energy production. This behaviour 
suggests that the complementarity between both 
resources could be subject to more detailed analysis in 
future.
Direct uses of renewables in heating, cooling 
and transport
There have been as yet no major deployment in the use 
of renewables as direct fuel for heating or transport. 
Biodiesel or biogasoline (referring mainly to ethanol 
produced from biomass feedstocks) is hardly used at 
all for transport (biodiesel only represented around 
0.1% in 2014). However, the country is developing 
biodiesel from vegetable oil. At least 11 pilot projects 
are growing the necessary feedstock crops, and two 
bioethanol projects are using sugar cane and sweet 
sorghum as feedstock (National Renewable Energy 
Laboratory, 2015). To date, they have not reached 
commercial scale.
Despite the low growth in renewables use for transport, 
there are electrification plans. Expansion of the existing 
Santo Domingo metro is planned. If renewables could 
meet the demand for new electricity, the transport 
sector’s renewables share would increase accordingly.
Biomethane is another potential technology option 
in the Dominican Republic transport system but no 
production has taken place yet. Today, more than 15 000 
natural gas vehicles refuel at 27 service stations. These 
figures are expected to increase and can increasingly 
be replaced with biomethane produced from various 
waste streams if cost-competitiveness allows (Institute 
of Americas, 2015).
Demand for heating (mainly for cooking and hot water) 
in Dominican Republic residential and commercials 
buildings is low, representing less than 20% of the 
total. Cooking and cooling account for the majority 
of the total energy use in residential buildings, which 
compares with significant demand for cooling and 
lighting in commercial buildings, notably hotels. There 
is still no market for cooling systems based on solar 
water heating and renewables. By comparison, other 
countries in the area, such as Barbados, have made 
important advances in deploying for instance solar 
thermal technologies for water heating thanks to longterm policies.

Hydropower (2008-2014) Wind (2013-2015)
Based on OC-SENI data (2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014a, 2015a)This section first describes the potential for renewable 
energy resources in the Dominican Republic (Section 
3.1). This is followed by the Reference Case with a 
view on the renewable energy prospects assumed in 
the Dominican Republic’s national energy planning 
(Section 3.2). By contrast, REmap proposes a more 
optimistic view of renewables, investigating the source 
of additional renewables potential and how it could be 
fulfilled. This takes into consideration the associated 
costs and savings arising from an accelerated renewable 
energy uptake (Section 3.3). The findings to 2030 for 
both cases are explained throughout this section.
3.1 Renewable energy resource 
potential
The Dominican Republic has abundant solar and 
wind resources. 26 Micro-hydropower also offers some 
remaining potential in certain parts of the country. 
Bioenergy potential is limited to several specific 
feedstocks but could benefit both from vast experience 
of sugar cane plantation and unexploited land without 
facing land use change or forestry resource concerns.
Solar potential is particularly large, with GHI levels 
at 5-7 kWh/m2/day across most parts of the country 
(Worldwatch Institute, 2015).27 Irradiance is consistent 
throughout the year, offering a particular advantage 
(with the maximum difference in irradiation reaching 
3 kWh/m2/day between December and July). For 
example, the irradiation levels in the two largest 
cities in the country, Santo Domingo in the South 
26 Further details on the distribution of renewable resources in 
Dominican Republic can be found online in IRENA’s Global Atlas 
tool. One of the maps available can be consulted in the next link: 
http://irena.masdar.ac.ae/?map=1694. Maps with GHI and wind 
speeds are also provided in the annexes of this report.
27 This is double the GHI levels observed in Germany, which are 
around 3 kWh/m2/day.
and Santiago de los Caballeros (Centre-North) average 
over 5 kWh/m2/day throughout the year. This provides 
favourable conditions for rooftop solar PV systems. 
Likewise, most tourist areas have at least the same 
level of resource availability for similar rooftop and/
or off-grid systems to completely or partly replace 
diesel-based systems. Solar system deployment for 
heating and cooling in buildings and industry are 
another avenue because the Dominican Republic also 
experiences strong direct normal irradiance.
Wind potential in this country is also large. A zoneby-zone analysis of wind potential shows that around 
half the nearly 500 grid points assessed has a capacity 
factor of at least 20%. Meanwhile, 120 and 78 points have 
capacity factors of at least 25% and 30% respectively 
(Worldwatch Institute, 2011).
Much of the country’s large hydropower potential 
has already been utilised. Potential exists to use this 
capacity more efficiently, thereby increasing individual 
plant capacity factors that are today limited by water 
dispatch regulation to prioritise water use for drinking 
and agriculture. By comparison, there is potential 
generation capacity from smaller hydropower plants 
amounting to tens or hundreds of kW, especially in the 
northern parts of the country.
IRENA’s analysis of the bioenergy supply potential 
in 2030 and the related supply costs according to 
feedstock is displayed in Table 7. Waste from the 
agriculture sector provides the greatest potential, as 
well as animal manure and household waste for biogas. 
Typical sources of agricultural waste include sugar cane, 
rice, coffee, banana and cocoa plantations. Apart from 
harvesting residues that require additional collection 
costs, these feedstocks come at affordable costs of 
USD 1-3/GJ. There is some potential for woody biomass 
(both fuel wood and forestry residues). However, this is 
low and its costs are significant (IRENA, 2014b).
3 RENEWABLES POTENTIAL BY 2030 
ACCORDING TO NATIONAL ENERGY 
PROJECTIONS AND REMAPThe country benefits from low- to high-temperature 
geothermal resources too but more studies are needed 
to determine the technical potential. To that end, MEM 
and the French National Geological Survey (BRGM) 
have signed an agreement to assess this in an initiative 
funded by the Inter-American Development Bank 
(DominicanToday, 2016). No data are yet available to 
work out the potential deployable geothermal capacity 
so this has not been not considered in the REmap 
Options assessment.28
3.2 Reference Case 2030
As mentioned in section 1.3, the Reference Case for 
the Dominican Republic was prepared on the basis 
of the preliminary results of the energy demand 
projections between 2013 and 2030 calculated by 
CNE and Fundación Bariloche (CNE, 2014a). They used 
the baseline scenario (escenario tendencial).29 The 
electricity demand and generation projections were 
scaled up to match total demand and supply estimated 
28 In addition, land suitable for sustainable sugar cane harvesting is 
available i.e. without affecting sugar cane for food production. This 
is estimated at around 100 000 hectares and also offers additional 
energy crop potential. For further details on supply potential and 
costs estimations, please refer to the IRENA paper on biofuels 
(IRENA, 2014b).
29 For bioenergy use in buildings, it was assumed that all woody 
bioenergy consumed in the residential sector corresponds to 
traditional uses of bioenergy. However, the minor amount of 
charcoal consumed was considered to be for modern uses. This 
assumption is maintained for the entire 2010-2030 period.
more recently for the period 2016-2030. These were 
provided by CNE.30
The Reference Case indicates the Dominican Republic’s 
demand for energy will increase by 41% between 2010 
(the base year for IRENA’s REmap analysis) and 2030 
from 220 PJ (5 254 ktoe) to 320 PJ (7 685 ktoe). This 
represents a growth of 1.9% per year in the same period.
Fuel consumption in transport increases by just under 
45%, continuing to make it the country’s largest energyconsuming sector with a total energy demand of 135 PJ 
(3 224 ktoe) in 2030. In industry, demand increases 
from 56 PJ (1 337 ktoe) in 2010 to 100 PJ (2 388 ktoe) in 
2030. For those years, buildings sector energy demand 
increases from 68 PJ (1 624 ktoe) to 86 PJ (2 054 ktoe). 
Demand growth in buildings is significantly lower than 
for the transport and industry sectors. This is explained 
by the substitution of traditional uses of bioenergy for 
cooking and heating with more efficient fuels such as 
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)/kerosene or modern 
bioenergy.
Total power generation also sees a significant increase. 
Annual generation doubles from 16 TWh to 35 TWh in 
2010-2030 (taking into consideration the whole power 
system i.e. SENI, off-grid systems and grid-connected 
autoproducers). Electricity consumption grows at a 
similar rate, resulting in a rise in annual demand from 
30 The projections provided were based on generator technology so 
the following assumption was made: all power generation capacity 
reported under the ‘dual’ category was considered a petroleum 
product (applies to power generation with combustion engine, 
combined cycle, open cycle etc.). However, this includes small 
volumes of natural gas during some generation periods.

Wood construction, demolition and furniture waste 1 1 17
Total 38 84 6-8.1about 14 TWh in 2010 to 31 TWh over the same period. 
The share of electricity consumption in the country’s 
total energy demand grows from 22% in 2010 to 34% 
in 2030. It amounts to about a quarter of total energy 
demand today.
In the Reference Case, the share of modern renewable 
energy in TFEC (excluding traditional uses of bioenergy) 
increases only slightly from 8% in 2010 to 13% in 2030. 
The renewable energy share shows only minor growth in 
the entire period but this does not mean renewables use 
does not grow. Instead, this is an outcome of the major 
increase in the country’s total energy consumption, 
which rises as fast as renewables demand.
When including traditional uses of bioenergy, the share 
of renewables in the total energy mix remains almost 
the same at around 16% throughout the period to 
2030. This is because traditional uses of bioenergy are 
replaced by modern forms as well as other modern fuels 
such as LPG or kerosene. These tend to show higher 
technical efficiencies for cooking or water heating, 
thereby utilising less fuel.
Renewables experience only limited additional direct 
use applications for heating and transport. The main 
development is for bioenergy in the industry sector, with 
additions of around 4 PJ (96 ktoe) for process heating. 
This comes to 13 PJ of bioenergy and represents 13% of 
energy demand in this sector. There are minor additions 
of solar thermal for buildings and liquid biofuels for 
transport, amounting to 0.6 PJ (14 ktoe) and 0.8 PJ 
(19 ktoe) respectively.
The renewable energy share in the power sector 
rises from 10% to 21%. The Reference Case sees an 
increase in hydropower generation (2.3 TWh), onshore 
wind (2.3  TWh) and bioenergy (almost 1 TWh) which 
combined amounts to less than the increase in 
conventional generation of almost 12.8 TWh. In the 
Reference Case, coal generation would by 2030 reach 
10 TWh, oil generation would reach 12.2 TWh (mainly 
fuel oil and diesel), and natural gas generation would 
reach 5.3 TWh.31
3.3 REmap
Power sector and potential for higher 
renewable energy uptake
The Reference Case projections indicate electricity 
demand growth will be increasingly covered by 
petroleum products, coal and natural gas generation 
capacity. REmap instead shows that a share of this 
new demand can actually by supplied by hydropower, 
onshore wind, solar PV and bioenergy. In the case of 
31 Values for the base year 2010 are given in this section, being this 
year the base for the REmap analysis, nevertheless values for 2014 
or 2015 when available have been provided in summary tables of 
results and annexes.

that would be decommissioned by 2030 could also be 
substituted with renewables.
Coal generation is the highest power capacity addition 
observed in the Reference Case and is estimated at 
four times higher than today. The renewables potential 
identified in REmap substitutes almost half of this 
additional capacity with small hydropower, utility-scale 
solar PV and landfill gas power generation. Moreover, all 
new petroleum-based generation capacity is substituted 
with onshore wind and solar PV.
Figure 25 depicts the location of the main solar PV, 
onshore wind and bioenergy power capacity that would 
be in place in 2030 under the REmap case. The detailed 
assumptions and findings are presented by technology. 
The power generation sector capacity and generation 
mix are summarised below in Table 8.
● Hydropower: up to 90% of all potential 
hydropower resources for large hydropower 
plants have already been exploited (Worldwatch 
Institute, 2015). Small hydropower therefore 
provides the remaining potential, that is defined 
in the current Dominican Republic renewable 
energy law as plants with capacity lower than 
5 MW. The 90 MW REmap addition implies 
building around than 20 small hydropower 
plants. Hydropower resources are spread across 
the country thus providing several opportunities 
where it is more environmental and economically 
feasible and where demand exists.
● Onshore wind: if the 50 MW limit for wind power 
capacity (explained above in section 2.3) is used 
as a reference, the total addition of REmap 
capacity of 1.5 GW translates to around 45 wind 
farms to be built between now and 2030. If each 
of the 78 points identified by the Worldwatch 
Institute (2011) can host a 50 MW wind farm, it 
would have a capacity factor exceeding 30%.
● Bagasse based combined heat and power 
(CHP): the country’s sugar cane production is 
expected to increase by around 40% by 2024 
(US Department of Agriculture, 2014). The main 
energy by-product from this industry is bagasse,

Background map from d-maps (n.d.)which is today combusted to supply power and 
heat to the sugar mills. There is major potential to 
increase combustion efficiency. Combined with 
growing production and improved efficiency, 
the resulting additional bagasse-based 
cogeneration capacity is estimated at 48 MW. 
This would be installed in three of the largest 
four sugar mills across the country, namely 
Cristóbal Colón, Barahona and Porvenir. As 
there is some CHP capacity already existing or 
planned in the Reference Case, the total power 
generation capacity in sugar mills reaches 148 
MW in REmap. This would be spread across the 
sugar mills as follows: 10 MW in Porvenir, 24 MW 
in Barahona, 54 MW in Central Romana and 
60  MW in Cristóbal Colón.32 It is assumed that 
the sugar mills would cogenerate electricity and 
heat mainly to prioritise their own energy needs, 
especially during the sugar cane harvest, which 
can last up to 200 days. Surplus electricity could 
be sold to the system.
● Biomass co-firing for power generation:
agriculture and small amounts of forestry 
residues can be used in co-firing plants, increasing 
installed capacity to 70 MW in REmap by 2030.
● Biogas for power generation: in the Reference 
Case, no growth is assumed from existing biogas 
power generation capacity. Hence, under the 
Reference Case, 2030 continues to see an 
installed capacity of around 790 kW from nine 
installations. REmap shows a realistic potential 
of 9 MW by 2030, implying around 60 farms in 
the country using biogas for power generation 
integrated with anaerobic digesters fed from 
animal manure.
● Landfill gas for power generation: there is major 
potential for waste-to-energy from municipal 
solid waste, especially from the country’s large 
landfills. Total daily urban solid waste amounts 
to around 8 000 tonnes, with the largest landfill 
(Duquesa) receiving more than 3 750 tonnes 
32 The sugar mills have the following existing power generation 
capacity to supply their own energy needs, according to the 
Worldwatch Institute (Worldwatch Institute, 2011): 3 MW in 
Porvenir, 6 MW in Barahona and 54 MW in Central Romana. In 
addition, the sugar mill Cristóbal Colón is commissioning a 30 MW 
plant.
(OPD, 2015). In the Reference Case, landfill 
gas generation includes the planned power 
generation project based on landfill gas at the 
Rafey site. This 80 MW power plant (40 MW 
biogas and 40 MW natural gas) is due to operate 
a combined cycle gas turbine and a steam 
turbine based on the gasification of municipal 
solid waste. The project is estimated to consume 
1 500 tonnes of waste per day (SIE, 2016).
REmap assumes the construction of an 80 MW 
landfill gas-powered plant for the Duquesa 
landfill site. This plant would utilise around 3 000 
tonnes of waste each day (assuming its design 
were similar to the planned Rafey landfill, which 
will have a gasifier). More than 350 landfills have 
been identified across the country (Ferreras, 
2015). If the 10 major and formal ones are 
considered, it could be possible to deploy the 
potential for around 60 MW in capacity on top of 
the one proposed for Duqesa landfill, increasing 
the total to 220 MW (assuming around 80 MW 
are deployed in the Reference Case, including the 
capacity in Rafey landfill).
● Solar PV utility-scale: there is an addition of 
871  MW for on-grid utility-scale solar PV. As 
shown in Figure 25, it is assumed that this will 
be located close to the main demand centres, 
namely in the provinces of Santiago and Santo 
Domingo. Considering the developments 
expected in the Reference Case, total installed 
capacity would be above 1 GW in REmap in 2030.
● Solar PV decentralised (on-grid): the alternative 
scenario in CNE demand projections considers 
250 MW of installed decentralised solar PV 
capacity. This has been taken into account and 
further expanded to include a 665 MW REmap 
Option comprising on-grid installations for 
residential and commercial use added to the 
Reference Case. This can be split into rooftop 
and ground-mounted systems, and the resulting 
generation would cover around 25% of buildings 
electricity demand. Assuming all of this is for 
rooftop systems, 3.7 million m2 in roof area is 
required for residential installations. This would 
represent about 2% of the available household 
rooftop area. Likewise, around 1.9 million m2
would be used for commercial installations, representing around 7% of available rooftop area 
for this type of building.
It is assumed that some of the decentralised PV 
capacity will be integrated with battery electric 
storage. The corresponding energy storage 
capacity for this in REmap is 440 MWh, and 17% 
of decentralised PV installations are built. This is 
an average 4 kWh/kW in energy storage.
● Solar PV for off-grid rural electrification: 
energy access is enhanced by the addition of 
off-grid PV for rural electrification. In developing 
countries, PV with storage is becoming 
increasingly common to provide electricity to 
rural regions lacking access to transmission 
or distribution networks (IRENA, 2016a). This 
includes residential and public off-grid PV 
installations with electric batteries (equivalent 
to 400 MWh of energy storage) which would 
increase the Dominican Republic electrification 
rate for remote rural areas.
The electrification rate today stands around 96%. 
According to CNE (2014a), this will reach 98% in 
2030 under the assumption that energy access 
programmes have greater coverage in the coming 
years. It identifies a solar PV potential of 102 MW 
for household electrification assuming that 
universal electricity access is achieved in 2030 i.e.
around 70 000 installations of 1.3 kilowatt-peak. 
For public and commercial applications, 9 MW 
are added in.

and buildings
In addition to the power generation sector potential, 
there is major potential for renewables in direct use 
applications for heating and cooling. This has so far 
been overlooked in the Dominican Republic energy 
projections used for the Reference Case. REmap 
identifies opportunities for direct renewables use 
for heating, cooling and cooking in buildings and for 
heating and cooling processes in the industry sector. 
Table 9 provides the results of the Reference Case and 
REmap mix, and further details by technology and 
sector are discussed below:
● Solar water heaters (SWH) in buildings:
the REmap Options estimate residential and 
commercial solar water heating potential of 
2.1 PJ. This is equivalent to adding 1.4 million m2
(around 960 megawatt-thermal – MWth) of solar 
collector capacity that would replace water 
heating boilers based on LPG or electricity. 
This is less than 1% of rooftop area available in 
2030 or around 2 600 commercial installations 
and 328 000 household installations. Around 
60% of the capacity is dedicated to installations 
in the commercial sector. This REmap Option 
concentrates on supplying 30% of energy 
demand for water heating in the residential 
and 35% in the commercial sector (nearly all to 
hotels).
● Solar energy for cooling in buildings: the REmap 
Option of 4.5 PJ for solar cooling would cover 
around 20% of the electricity demand used for 
space cooling in buildings in 2030. This 350 MW 
addition equates to 0.5 km2 of thermal collectors 
or around 71 000 installations. Less than 0.5% 
of rooftop area available in 2030 is required to 
install the collectors. In that year, energy demand 
for cooling is estimated to amount to 20% of 
buildings total energy demand.
● Solar energy for process heat in industry: this 
REmap Option would represent an additional 85 
MW in solar energy for industrial process heat. 
About half the capacity is based on flat plate 
solar and the rest on concentrated solar thermal 
(CST) collectors. This would imply around 77 and 
16 installations respectively in different sites in 
the countrys manufacturing plants. This provides 
over 0.7 PJ of heat in the form of hot water and 
steam, which would cover 15% of the energy 
required for low-temperature process heat 
generation (below 150 °C).
● Solar energy for cooling in industry: this REmap 
Option, amounting to 40 MW, is equivalent 
to around 85 solar cooling installations in the 
country’s food sector, which is one of its largest 
energy consumers.
● Anaerobic digester biogas for cooking in 
hospitality sector: this REmap Option is 
calculated for the hospitality sector, in which 
organic waste from food and cooking can 
generate biogas reused for cooking. This REmap 
Option would imply around 100 installations of 
this type.
● Seawater air conditioning (SWAC): this REmap 
Option would provide 4 440 tonnes of cooling 
mainly for the hospitality sector. The potential 
identified means introducing seawater cooling 
in the touristic zone of Puerto Plata. The Remap 
Option of 0.4 PJ covers 5% of cooling demand in 
buildings.
● Modern solid biomass for cooking: the amount 
of traditional bioenergy used today in the 
residential sector (mainly for cooking and to 
some extent water heating) is almost a quarter of 
buildings energy use. According to a CNE study 
(Cruz Castillo, 2014), around 12% of Dominican 
Republic households still lack modern energy 
access for cooking, relying mainly on wood fuel 
and charcoal. Although demand for traditional 
forms of bioenergy declines significantly, the 
Reference Case also indicates it persists in 2030. 
Its share decreases to just above 10% of total 
energy use in buildings. In REmap, all traditional 
bioenergy use replaced by modern bioenergy 
divides into 40% biogas and 60% solid biofuels.33
Each of these is two or three times more efficient.
33 The REmap methodology does not allow for the replacement 
of traditional biomass by fossil fuels such as LPG. However, this 
replacement is assumed to have occurred in the Reference Case 
because traditional biomass use declines by about 25%, and oil 
product use increases by around 75%.● Anaerobic digester biogas in the residential 
sector – this REmap Option concerns modern 
energy access in the residential sector. This means 
substituting traditional uses of solid biomass 
for cooking in the Reference Case with biogas 
derived from anaerobic digesters for households.
● Solid biomass for cooking (modern) – this 
REmap Option concerns modern energy access 
in the residential sector. This means substituting 
traditional uses of solid biomass for cooking in 
the Reference Case with efficient biomass cook 
stoves in REmap 2030.
● Not specified – includes all modern biomass for 
cooking and heating purposes which is part of 
Reference Case, with no technology specified.
Role of renewables in the transport sector
The main results and related indicators for the REmap 
case in the transport sector are presented in Table 10. 
The two main options for transport based on renewables 
are electrification sourced with renewable power and 
biofuels – both liquid biofuels and biomethane. The 
resulting number of battery electric passenger road 
vehicles (60 000) in REmap would represent around 4% 
of total passenger road vehicle stock in 2030. Likewise, 
160 000 plug-in hybrid electric (PHEV) passenger road 
vehicles would make up around 11% of the total.34
The electrification of public transport has also been 
considered as an option which adds around 1 100 battery 
electric buses. This represents around 6% of public 
transport bus stock estimated for 2030. In addition, 
375 000 two- and three-wheelers are estimated, raising 
the share of electric vehicles in the passenger road 
vehicle stock to 30%.
There is potential to deploy biogasoline from sugar 
cane (conventional ethanol) as well as from bagasse 
(advanced ethanol). Hundreds of thousands of hectares 
of land previously used for sugar cane production are 
no longer harvested so a fraction of this arable land 
34 All traditional uses of biomass projected in the Reference Case are 
substituted with modern forms of biomass in REmap 2030 (40% 
with biogas and 60% with modern biomass cook stoves).

of 40 000 hectares for ethanol production yields 
conventional ethanol production of 173 million litres per 
year in 2030. This would mean a volumetric blend of 14% 
with gasoline.35 In addition, 20 million litres of advanced 
ethanol from the remaining quantities of bagasse has 
been estimated for 2030. Finally, additional biodiesel 
potential in 2030 equating to 20 million litres per year 
and added to the 30 million litres in the Reference Case 
raises the blend to 5% in REmap.36
The increased use of electric vehicles provides a 
significant new potential source of mobile storage. 
This is one flexibility option for the Dominican Republic 
power sector, which will increasingly be required to 
accommodate a higher share of variable renewables 
because renewable electricity generation does not 
always match demand. In the Dominican Republic, 
this is particularly important given that the demand 
profile is rather flat (as shown in Figure 8 in Chapter 
2) and is somewhat higher during the evening. Since 
PV generation reaches its peak at midday, a significant 
increase in electricity produced from this technology 
would change the residual load duration curve (see 
35 This is in line with the CNE alternative scenario projection for 
energy.
36 This addition is based on the CNE alternative scenario projection 
for demand.
Section 4.1). This depends on the share and mix of 
variable renewable energy (VRE) (Ueckerdt et al., 2015).
The energy storage offered by electric vehicles can be 
deployed under a range of schemes. It could provide 
services and flexibility measures for load shedding 
and dispatch to the power system. It could reduce 
curtailment in hours where renewables generation 
exceeds maximum penetration of VRE allowed in the 
system. According to REmap findings, electricity storage 
capacity from two- and three-wheelers, passenger road 
vehicles and electric buses for urban transportation 
could provide a 1.4 GWh in energy storage.
Summary of REmap Options
In the Reference Case, final renewable energy use is 
forecast to slightly increase from 37 PJ in 2010 and 38 in 
2014 to 52 PJ in 2030 (1 234 ktoe, Figure 26). Bioenergy 
in 2010 accounted for 83% of total final renewable 
energy use and continues to dominate the mix in 2030 
although its share is expected to decrease to 77% 
in 2030. The hydropower portion falls from 16.3% to 
14.6% because of wind power growth, which rises from 
negligible use to 5% of total final renewable energy use. 
In the electricity sector, hydropower and wind account 
for most total renewable power production, followed 
by bioenergy. In the Reference Case, bioenergy remains 
the main heating and transport sector source. With

for nearly 30% of total final renewables use in 2030 
under the Reference Case compared to 17% in 2010 at 
the expense of the heating/cooling sector. This sees its 
share of total final renewables use falling from 83% to 
69% in the same period.
With all REmap Options implemented, total renewable 
energy use in the Dominican Republic TFEC would reach 
87 PJ (2 080 ktoe) in REmap, double the 2010 level. More 
than 60% of this would be renewable power (57 PJ) and 
the remainder heating, cooling and transport fuels 
(30 PJ). Modern renewable energy use in the Dominican 
Republic TFEC would reach 27% in REmap compared 
to 8% between 2010 and 2014 and 13% in the Reference 
Case in 2030. Installed renewable power generation 
capacity would rise from 2.4 GW in the Reference Case 
to 5.8 GW in REmap. The increase comes mainly from 
wind (an additional 1 453 MW), solar PV (1 532 MW) and 
biomass power (268 MW).
Figure 27 shows renewable energy developments by 
sector in 2010-2030. Compared to their TFEC, buildings 
and industry would have the biggest renewable energy 
share in REmap, at 43% and 41% respectively, not

2010 2014 Reference Case 2030 REmap 2030these are accounted for, each sectors renewable energy 
share is estimated at 45% and 44% respectively as shown 
in the figure below. The transport renewable energy share 
would rise to 5.1% in REmap from around 0.3% in 2010. In 
power generation, the renewable energy share increases 
to 44% in REmap from almost 10% in 2010 (12% in 2014) 
or from 21% in the Reference Case in 2030.
Biomass would remain an important source of 
renewables in the Dominican Republic, accounting 
for about half the total final renewable energy use in 
REmap. However, this is still significantly lower than the 
83% in 2010. Solar and wind would account for 15% and 
22% respectively. The share of hydropower compared 
to total renewable electricity would fall from more 
than 90% today to 26% by 2030. This is explained by 
the substantial growth in all other renewable energy 
sources in 2010-2030.
This section has focused entirely on the role of renewables 
in the Dominican Republic. However, demand for energy 
is growing rapidly so the renewables potential needs 
to be complemented by energy efficiency to reduce 
demand growth. This will enable a higher share of 
renewables and avoid energy-related CO2 emissionsand 
air pollution (see below in Section 5).The Dominican Republic has several main objectives for 
its energy future. It wishes to supply growing demand 
for energy securely and affordably, ensure actors 
involved in the power sector make a profit, meet power 
supply quality standards and shift to a lower-carbon 
system. However, like any other developing economy it 
could encounter a number of challenges while coping 
with growing energy demand.
This chapter provides more detail on the potential 
difficulties the Dominican Republic may face as its 
renewable energy share under REmap grows to 27% by 
2030 in the total energy mix. It starts with the obstacles 
in the power sector (Section 4.1) by paying particular 
attention to institutional, regulatory, economic and 
technical issues. Potential concerns affecting end-use 
by buildings, industry and transport follow (Section 4.2). 
Given bioenergy is a cross-cutting resource offering 
potential for all sectors, its challenges are discussed 
separately.
Each main concern is matched with several suggestions 
for policy makers and other stakeholders to consider. 
The objective of this chapter is not to provide policy 
makers with a microscopic examination of challenges 
and potential solutions. Rather, it identifies and draws 
attention to the most significant areas affecting the 
delivery of a higher share of renewables. A detailed 
evaluation of each challenge would require further 
in-depth investigation, which is beyond the scope of 
this study. The purpose of this section is not to replace a 
detailed power or energy system analysis; the purpose 
of raising awareness of these challenges is to assist 
high-level decision-making.
4.1 Power sector
Institutional and economic challenges
Since the first reform in the late 1990s, the power 
sector in the Dominican Republic has gone through 
a number of difficulties. These have affected all the 
stakeholders in the power supply chain and have 
required government intervention to support the sector 
with different incentive schemes. According to the 2010 
National Energy Plan (PEN 2010) (CNE, 2010), the main 
challenges to the sector more than a decade after the 
reform included (CNE, 2010):
● financial sustainability
● high dependency on oil products and vulnerability 
to price volatility
● loss of confidence by private investors
● loss of consumer confidence in the sector’s 
ability to provide a reliable, sustainable and costeffective service
● lack of engagement of private investors in the 
electricity distribution sector
According to CNE (2010, 2008) the main reasons for 
the problems are as follows: high dependency on fossil 
fuels coupled with increasing international oil prices; 
political difficulties in passing increased production 
costs onto the tariff; and difficulties in reducing nontechnical electricity losses and increasing tariff revenue 
collection.
The Organic Law on National Development Strategy 
of the Dominican Republic 2030 enacted in 2012 
establishes a reliable, efficient and sustainable energy 
supply as one of its general objectives (Ministry of 
Economy, Planning and Development, 2012). One 
specific aim is to ensure a reliable electricity supply 
with competitive prices and conditions for financial and 
environmental sustainability. To achieve this, six lines 
of action address the challenges currently experienced 
by the power sector to open up new opportunities for 
deploying renewables. The lines of action include:
1) Promote the diversification of the generation 
mix, focusing on the deployment of renewable 
and clean sources like solar and wind.
2) Strengthen the power sector institutional and 
regulatory framework to ensure competitive 
4 WHAT IS NEEDED TO FULFIL REMAP 
POTENTIAL?tariffs and promote the investments for sector 
development.
3) Plan and promote the development of the 
generation, transmission and distribution 
infrastructure to operate the power system 
with the quality and reliability criteria set by the 
standards.
4) Promote the application of strong environmental 
regulation in power generation to adopt 
sustainable practices and mitigate climate 
change.
5) Develop the right culture to promote energy 
efficiency.
6) Promote a civic and private sector culture aiming 
for energy efficiency by introducing rational 
energy practices and encourage the usage of 
processes and equipment allowing more efficient 
use of energy.
In addition to this, the law on national development 
strategy foresees the completion of a pact between all 
stakeholders (known as Pacto Eléctrico) to solve the 
crisis that has affected the power sector. The pact was 
drafted in 2015, and discussions are ongoing.
This step forward is one of several indicating progress 
towards achieving the established targets. Measurable 
changes like reduced fuel oil consumption for power 
generation, the increase in the distribution company 
Cash Recovery Index (CRI) and reduced debt to the 
generation companies can be similarly interpreted. 
However, there is a long way to go yet.
Fulfilling the potential in REmap may not pose 
particularly great challenges from an institutional or 
regulatory perspective in relation to current experience 
and the Reference Case for 2030. However, the creation 
of an enabling environment for realising this potential 
will still be important.
A consultation with experts from the power sector has 
shed some light on the main barriers obstructing the 
development of renewables today. This consultation 
goes beyond reports performed by the government 
and other organisations. Some of these findings are 
presented below as perceived by stakeholders. This 
section does not provide a complete overview of all 
barriers. Its aim is to inform the reader of the view of 
stakeholders directly involved in day-to-day renewables 
implementation in the Dominican Republic’s power 
system:
● Stability of the regulatory framework. Law 57-
07 amended in 2012 is in the process of being 
amended again to revise the provisions relating 
to fiscal incentives. The incentives work as income 
tax credits that are equivalent to a share of the 
total investment to be redeemed in three years. 
The share of investment eligible to receive credits 
was cut from 75% to 40%. This modification has, 
on one hand, decreased renewables investment 
attractiveness to autoproducers, and on the other 
created uncertainty in the regulatory framework 
and in governmental decisions.
● Co-ordination and a common vision among 
the different national institutions is needed if 
they deal directly or indirectly with renewable 
energy regulation, implementation etc. This 
concerns the effective implementation of the 
existing legislation and incentives, as well as 
administrative procedures.37
● Human capacity-building to implement 
effective regulation and planning for 
renewables deployment. This needs to be 
expanded and improved in relation to renewable 
energy technology and potential and the use 
of modern fuels, especially for decision-makers 
or policy makers defining laws, regulations and 
planning. Policy makers and key decision-makers 
in the energy sector should also pursue a holistic 
vision of the needs and challenges arising in the 
energy system as a whole when renewables are 
included.
37 One example of the lack of co-ordination and common view 
among government institutions is the change to Law 57-07 on 
fiscal incentives for renewable investments. Some government 
bodies may be erroneously perceiving a decrease in tax collected 
due to a high fiscal incentive. This perception also relates to the 
approach used to estimate taxation. For example, an autoproducer 
decreasing its expenses with a lower energy bill earns a higher 
income and thus pays higher income taxes in the long term. Taking 
a more systemic approach, the reduction in the industry energy 
bill also stimulates its competitiveness, yielding accompanying 
economic benefits for the Dominican Republic. These are 
overlooked when discussing suitable incentives for renewables.● Effective implementation of existing and 
future regulation. Law 57-07 established a good 
regulatory framework with general guidelines, 
yet there have been some limitations to effective 
implementation of its provisions. Coupled with a 
somewhat immature renewable energy sector, 
this has resulted in some less effective or efficient 
results than foreseen.
● Development of regulations that fit the national 
context. When drafting and implementing 
the renewable energy laws and its secondary 
legislation, some provisions are based on 
international practice and often benchmarked 
with developed countries, which successfully 
pioneered renewable energy. This approach 
is a good start to constructing the necessary 
frameworks but over the long term may not be 
effective because these frameworks need to 
adjust to national circumstances.
In general, stakeholders believe that the Dominican 
Republic needs to guarantee a stable regulatory 
framework and better co-ordination between the 
different governmental entities involved with renewable 
energy at all angles. This needs to start with policy 
and planning and continue all the way through to 
implementation. This is essential to ensure the sector 
functions correctly, and to incentivise private sector 
participation in future developments.
Deploying renewable resources in the Dominican 
Republic power system will mean overcoming existing 
and future institutional and technical challenges. As well 
as attaining the strategic targets in the energy plans 
to overcome current institutional difficulties, a new 
comprehensive action plan is needed. This should deal 
with potential future grid operation issues arising from a 
high share of VRE like wind and solar PV. This especially 
if VRE are to play a major role in the total national 
electricity production.
The technical challenges
VRE resources have different physical characteristics 
and are usually operated differently from conventional 
power generation plants. Depending on the share of 
VRE and the power system features, these differences 
may prompt changes in the way the systems are planned 
and operated to guarantee a reliable electricity supply.
Figure 28 summarises the characteristics of VRE 
technologies, and how these could impact the operation 
of the power systems.

Impacts
T&D – Transmission and distributionThe REmap Options include high amounts of VRE 
generation resources. Their integration into the 
electricity system of the Dominican Republic would 
make an impact at the technical level. System planners 
and operators should be aware of these impacts and 
be prepared to implement the required measures 
to guarantee the reliable and economic supply of 
electricity.
A qualitative and simple description of the main 
technical challenges to be expected from the integration 
of the VRE REmap Options in the power system of the 
Dominican Republic is given in the sections below. 
This description is not intended to replace a detailed 
power system simulation studies. It aims to provide a 
reference to identify potential issues that may require 
the attention of the sector planners, policy-makers, and 
operators.
Detailed grid integration studies are recommended 
to assess the challenges described below and identify 
their potential impact and appropriate measures to 
overcome them. This should precede any steps to 
implement high amounts of variable renewables. The 
challenges identified are explained further below.
Challenge 1: Generation adequacy and 
utilisation of conventional generation fleet
One potential problem is whether enough energy and 
power would be available to meet growing demand 
for electricity at any given time. The variability of the 
resources leads to low VRE firm capacity. This creates 
uncertainty associated with the amount of generation 
that these technologies could provide, and on the 
amount of installed capacity required.
According to the country’s projections, peak power 
demand within SENI is to increase from about 2.63 GW 
in 2015 to about 4.5 GW in 2030. Figure 29 shows the 
projected demand growth for two scenarios and the 
corresponding hourly load duration curve. The 2030 
medium- and low-growth scenarios were obtained by 
scaling 2015 demand according to the expected growth 
rate. Only the medium-growth case is analysed below, 
which looks at the expected production of power from 
VRE resources and the residual load duration curves for 
2030 with Remap options.
The installed capacity under the REmap case for the 
power sector reaches 2.3 GW and 1.7 GW of gridconnected onshore wind and solar PV developments 
respectively. The location and size of the developments 
is summarised in Table 11. Both solar and wind 
developments were located using a resource assessment 
study carried out by the Worldwatch Institute 
(Worldwatch Institute, 2015). These figures represent 
the installed capacity for the regions rather than the 
installed capacity of individual power plants. For 
instance, the reported wind capacity for La Altagracia 
means 192 MW of wind could be installed in the region 
through one or more power plants.
The performance of the solar PV power plants was 
modelled using PVLIB, an open source modelling 
tool developed by the PV Performance Modelling

and Groenendyk, n.d.; PV Performance Modelling 
Collaborative, 2014). Solar radiation, wind speed and 
ambient temperatures reported by the Worldwatch 
Institute were the inputs for the tool. In both Santiago 
and Santo Domingo, the utility-scale resources 
were modelled by ten power plants with 54 MW of 
installed capacity. Similarly, grid connected distributed 
generation was assumed to only occur in Santiago and 
Santo Domingo. These encompassed the aggregated 
modelling of 114 667 individual power plants with 3 kW 
nameplate capacity.
The performance of the wind developments was taken 
from the Worldwatch Institute report (Worldwatch 
Institute, 2011). This shows the aggregated 
performance of different power plants in six different 
regions based on hourly synthetically generated data. 
This performance is assumed to continue, and only 
installed capacity for each region was escalated. The 
share of installed capacity for each region was also 
retained.
PV and wind production for the entire year were then 
modelled and compared to projected power demand. 
This allowed the calculation of load duration and residual 
load duration curves for the year 2030. Figure 30 shows 
the resulting curves, and compares them with the 2015 
load duration curve.
Figure 30 shows that the residual peak demand is 
high when compared to peak demand – 3.95 GW 
and 4.55 GW respectively. This means there at least 
3.95 GW of dispatchable generation capacity is needed 
to cover demand for electricity when production from 
VRE is available. This requirement increases to the full 
4.55  GW when no production from VRE is available. 
The line represented by red dashes corresponds to the 
expected installed capacity without hydropower and 
without VRE in 2030. As can be seen, non-VRE installed 
capacity without hydropower is higher than peak 
demand. This in turn means that enough capacity would 
exist to cover demand at any given time even when 
no VRE resources are available. However, appropriate 
financial mechanisms need to guarantee that this firm 
capacity exists in 2030. If hydropower is taken into 
account, the system would have larger reserve margins. 
Nonetheless, a detailed generation adequacy study 
is strongly recommended to validate and strengthen 
these conclusions.
The area below the line represented by blue dashes in 
Figure 30 illustrates the amount of energy consumed 
in 2015, and generated with dispatchable power 
plants. Wind generation exists but its contribution to 
generation is very low, and therefore, not considered 
in this analysis. The amount of energy required by 
dispatchable plants in 2030 depends on the level of 
VRE curtailment imposed. In this analysis, it is assumed 
that the level of curtailment is defined by VRE maximum 
instantaneous power penetration restrictions, which 
associated with the system stability. These restrictions 
are further discussed in the next challenge. For this 
analysis, three possibilities were evaluated: curtailment 
at 55% and 75% instantaneous penetration levels, and 
no curtailment. Table 12 condenses the results of the 
three scenarios.
Under the no curtailment scenario, the amount of energy 
required from dispatchable (non-VRE) sources would be 
represented by the two yellow areas in Figure 30, while 
the energy generated from VRE would be the sum of 
the green and the two orange areas. Under this scenario, 
the share of VRE in electricity production would amount

plants would amount to 4.86% less than that produced 
in 2015. The dark yellow area at the left represents the 
energy that has to be generated by dispatchable power 
plants and not required in 2015. That area could be 
viewed as the required “growth” for dispatchable power 
plants. The height of this area represents the required 
installed capacity while the x axis dimension represents 
the amount of time this capacity would be required. The 
x axis is the percentage of hours in a year.
All this signals two important conclusions for the energy 
mix. Firstly, less energy from dispatchable plants is 
required. This means these plants would sell less energy, 
thus affecting their profitability or at least the revenue 
from sales of energy. This is even more accentuated 
if considering new thermal power plants planned or 
under construction. The profitability of these plants 
could also be affected by their low utilisation factors (as 
required by the system). Low utilisation factors could 
signify more frequent plant and engine start-ups, which 
can increase plant operating costs, and accelerate its 
degradation. Plant operating costs increases due to 
the need of running the power plants at sub-optimal 
efficiency operating points (Edmundus et al., 2015; 
Trüby, 2014).
The ‘no limit’ scenario is more illustrative than 
realistic. Even power systems with the most 
advanced operational practices impose instantaneous 
penetration limits to non-synchronous generation. 
The amount of energy supplied by VRE under the 
75% instantaneous penetration limit would equal the 
green plus the light orange area. The energy required 
from dispatchable plants would be represented 
by the two yellow areas added to the dark orange 
area (see Figure 30). Under this scenario, the total 
production of VRE would amount to about 44% of 
total electricity generated, while about 1.7% of the VRE 
generation would have to be curtailed. This curtailment 
is relatively small and would probably not jeopardise 
project development. The share of dispatchable plants 
under this scenario is 3.56% lower than the share in 
2015. Again, this could affect the profitability of these 
power plants.
The last scenario analysed is within a 55% instantaneous 
penetration limit. Under this scenario, the share of 
electricity generated by VRE would be 41%. There is 
less VRE participation in electricity generation because 
up to 9.8% of possible VRE generation is curtailed. This 
curtailment could decrease the profitability of VRE 
projects but increase the profitability of dispatchable 
(non-VRE) projects. Electricity generation by 
dispatchable plants would be 2.8% higher than in 2015.
This simplified assessment of firm capacity requirements 
and conventional generation utilisation draws out the 
following conclusions:
● The energy required from dispatchable power 
plants depends on the production and need for 
VRE technology curtailment. Forecast models for 
long- and mid-term planning are thus essential 
and must be accurate. This could help size 
the amount of fuel required by thermal and 
hydropower plants, which in turn, could lead 
to better economic decisions in terms of when 
and how much fuel to buy. Long- and mid-term 
forecasts could also allow better reserve planning 
over that timeframe.
● At the level of penetration proposed in REmap 
relating to installed capacity, VRE could provide 
41%-45% of electricity consumed in the Dominican 
Republic, depending on VRE curtailment. The 
latter is another important parameter because 
it could make a negative impact on VRE project 
profitability. Diminishing the amount of energy 
required by dispatchable power plants could also 
affect their profitability as well as reducing their 
utilisation factor, increasing cycling or requiring 
more frequent start-ups.
● The study suggests there could be enough 
installed dispatchable power plant capacity for 
2030 under this scenario (REmap). The installed 
capacity of hydropower would probably mean 
some of the older non-hydro power plants 
could be decommissioned without affecting the 
system’s supply security (see Figure 30).
The previous conclusions require detailed generation 
adequacy studies in which seasonality, volatility of 
primary energy prices and other variables are 
stochastically managed. This type of study could 
strengthen the conclusions drawn here. Generation 
adequacy studies could also serve to size reserve 
allocation and assess the need for new generation 
scheduling practices.Challenge 2: Managing high instantaneous 
VRE penetration levels
Regardless of the presence or share of VRE in a power 
system, balance between power generation and 
demand has to be achieved. Power imbalances may lead 
to system frequency diversions from its nominal value. 
If improperly handled, these could result in serious 
operational and stability problems, or even complete 
system blackouts.
Traditionally, balancing activities have been supported 
by large, fully controlled synchronous generators 
such as diesel and other thermal power plants. These 
generators provide inertia and governor response to 
the system, which help to manage contingency events 
without major impacts.
A system containing a high level of VRE would displace 
some of these conventional synchronous generators, 
thus lowering the rotating inertia. In turn, this means 
that the more VRE are in a system, the bigger and 
faster frequency excursions could occur. This especially 
critical in isolated power systems like in the Dominican 
Republic, and even more in the event of contingencies.
Measures to overcome this challenge exists, including, 
fast frequency response electricity storage, VRE 
production curtailment, interconnection with 
neighbouring power systems, designating must-run 
power plants for system reliability, or the requirement 
for VRE to support balancing activities. The latter is a 
requirement included in the most advanced grid codes 
(IRENA, 2016e). The most appropriate solution depends 
the country’s particular grid characteristics, costs and 
economic projections.
The scale of the potential problem in the Dominican 
Republic under the REmap case was assessed by 
estimating the expected instantaneous penetration 
level of VRE (non-synchronous generation). This was 
achieved by dividing expected VRE generation by 
expected demand for each hour of the year in 2030, 
both calculated in the previous section.
Figure 31 depicts the estimated instantaneous 
penetration of VRE (non-synchronous generation) in 
2030 under the REmap case. The figure shows an 
instantaneous VRE penetration range of 11.9%-125.4% of 
demand. Current practice in the most advanced isolated 
or nearly isolated power systems, such as Ireland, limit 
instant penetration to about 55% of demand (EIRGRID 
and SONI, 2016a) mainly because of grid stability 
issues. The limit to instantaneous VRE penetration in 
the system may result in VRE power curtailment. This 
means not all the potential available variable renewable 
electricity is utilised.
VRE curtailment is not necessarily unacceptable in a 
power system. When a large share of VRE is planned in 
a system, possible changes in infrastructure, regulation, 
market design and system operation are needed. 
Curtailment could then provide a temporary solution in 
anticipation of further adaptations to the system (NREL, 
2013). These may include acquiring the necessary 
technical skill to manage a system with low inertia.
Renewable energy curtailment in the Dominican 
Republic could rise to as much as 10% if instant 
penetration is limited to 55% of demand. If instantaneous 
penetration is allowed to reach 75% of the demand, VRE 
curtailment could fall below 2% with REmap options. 
The 55% and 75% represent the current and future 
targeted instantaneous penetration limits in poorly 
connected front runner power systems (EIRGRID and 
SONI, 2016a, 2016b).
Figure 31 shows that a 55% instantaneous penetration 
limit would require VRE curtailment up to 29.6% of the 
time in a given year. The corresponding number for 75% 
instantaneous penetration is 8.8%.
This simplified assessment reveals the important 
message that instant VRE penetration (nonsynchronous generation) could impose a technical 
challenge on the operation of the system. VRE power 
curtailment could act as a countermeasure to allow 
infrastructural, regulatory, operational and market 
design changes ushering in a reliable system at higher 
instantaneous VRE penetration levels. As with the 
previous challenge, in-depth analysis of the system 
and especially of its stability would disclose the actual 
limits to instantaneous penetration of non-synchronous 
generation and the consequent curtailment expected. 
The 55% and 75% limits used in this simplified analysis 
assume that state-of-the-art infrastructure, regulatory, 
market and operational measures are embedded in 
the Dominican Republic. All these measures have to be 
co-ordinated and built in line with the same vision of 
the sector, matching technical grid code specifications with market incentives, regulatory framework and 
operational needs is key.
Challenge 3: Flexibility requirements due 
to change in the system net load and 
management of different and more uncertain 
ramp rates
In general terms, challenges associated with the 
balance between power demand and power generation 
within a timeframe of seconds and milliseconds are 
related with the instantaneous penetration levels of 
VRE. These challenges have been discussed above. 
Power balance (demand plus losses minus generation) 
within longer timeframes is managed through forward 
generation scheduling, which is planned ahead. This 
generation scheduling ensures that enough power can 
be generated to cover all demand.
System operators do not know the exact demand 
ahead of time. Thus, in order to create the generation 
scheduling, they rely on forecasts. Deviations between 
forecast and actual demand are resolved by adjusting 
the output of some generation units that are able to 
rapidly do so (or changing the demand by adjusting the 
load, which is often known as demand-side response). 
When demand exceeds the forecasts, balance is 
guaranteed by means of the so-called, operational 
reserves. The operational reserves are composed of 
power generation capacity that can be deployed within 
a short timeframe (shorter than the dispatch periods). 
Typically, the generation scheduling programmes are 
completed one day ahead with intervals that range 
between 15 minutes and one hour.
In building the generation scheduling programmes, 
system operators take into account several factors, 
including: the overall cost of power production of each 
generation unit and each unit’s ability to change its 
power output (the speed at which a unit is able to 
change its power output depends on the particular 
technology and equipment used); previously committed

events); and uncertainty associated with the demand 
forecasts and VRE generation forecasts.
In an ideal scenario there would be no unforeseen 
events (such as plant outages), and no uncertainty 
in demand and generation, including the power 
produced by VRE. In reality, events do happen, and 
demand and VRE generation prediction models are 
not 100% accurate. Scheduling and dispatch practices 
therefore need to be reviewed to account for new 
uncertainties arising from the introduction of VRE. 
Within the timeframe of the dispatch intervals, 
the uncertainty and risks accompanying these 
technologies must be mitigated through operational 
reserves, or other means. This would compensate 
for potential differences between planned output 
generation and actual power demand.
The increased need for ramping capabilities to cover 
the forecasted demand for power is another challenge 
related to the incorporation of VRE into a power system. 
This also affects the generation scheduling programmes. 
The ramp of a power generating unit is defined as its 
ability to increase or decrease its power output within 
a certain amount of time. A power system with no 
VRE would still have ramping requirements. However, 
these requirements would only be a function of power 
demand (the extent to which power demand changes 
from one dispatch period to the next).
VRE power output can experience rapid, unexpected 
and steep changes. Thus, the ramping requirements of 
a system with a large share of VRE can be larger and 
more uncertain. The increased ramping requirement 
from dispatchable units caused by the presence of 
VRE can be explained by the speed of change of VRE 
power output. For instance, it is logically expected 
that at sunset the power generated from all PV power 
plants would decrease. At those times, dispatchable 
units would have to ramp up or increase their power 
production to account for the power that is no longer 
produced by the PV power plants. The uncertainty and 
variability of VRE power generation leads to higher and 
more uncertain ramping capabilities needs.
To assess whether the Dominican Republic could 
easily handle ramping requirements under the REmap 
scenario, the required ramps by the system in 2015 
were calculated and compared to those required in 
2030. Figure 30 shows the comparison. The 2015 ramps 
were obtained by analysing real operational data with 
one-hour resolution without demand-side management 
measures. Extreme events, such as blackouts were 
excluded from the analysis by applying a ± 3 standard 
deviation filter. The 2030 scenarios were constructed by 
analysing the estimated net load with REmap options 
and without new VRE generation – again with no 
demand-side management measures.
The maximum one-hour ramp requirement by the 
system changes from about 296 MW per hour in 2015 
to about 514 MW per hour in 2030. This is a substantial 
increase in ramp requirements, but only represent 
the estimated changes in the demand profile. The big 
ramping requirement change can be explained by the 
expected growth of the demand (peak demand passes 
from 2.63 GW in 2015 to about 4.5 GW in 2030). The 
maximum one-hour ramp requirement by the system 
in 2030 with the REmap scenario is about 695 MW per 
hour, which represents about a 35% increase in ramping 
needs due to the introduction of VRE (comparing the 
two 2030 scenarios).
The 35% increase in ramp requirements in nominal terms 
(MW per hour) seems big. However, if the requirement 
is compared to as a percentage of the peak demand 
in the system, the increase in ramp requirement due to 
the introduction of VRE in the system is not as big. In 
2015, the ramp requirements of the system are about 
11.2% of the peak demand (296 MW per hour divided by 
2.63 GW). Similarly, the ramp requirements by the system 
in 2030 is 11.2% and 15.4% of the peak demand without 
and with REmap Options (514 MW per hour divided by 
4.5 GW, and 695 MW per hour divided by 4.5 GW).
The green line in Figure 30, representing the system 
in 2030 with REmap Options, is steeper in the middle 
region when compared with the other scenarios (from 
about 20% to 80% of the hours of the year). This 
suggests ramp requirements would be more variable. 
The variability of ramp requirements should be assessed 
because of the implications on measures that the system 
operator would have to take. The green line is also much 
steeper than the blue one at around 0%-20% of the 
time, which suggests that steeper ramp requirements 
would be needed under the REmap scenario. In turn, 
this means that the high ramping capacity would be Figure 32: Ramp duration curve for 2015 and 2030 with REmap VRE

due to VREutilised for only very short periods of time. This should 
also be assessed in order to ensure that appropriate 
regulatory measures are taken to ensure the ramping 
capacity exists when needed.
The effects of VRE introduction in the Dominican 
Republic can also be assessed through ramp envelopes 
in Figure 31. These envelope curves indicate the ramp 
requirements of the system in a multi-hour timeframe. 
The multi-hour ramps are useful when allocating 
operational reserves and when designing the generation 
scheduling programmes. The line represented by 
magenta dashes in Figure 31 symbolises the ramping 
requirements of the system in 2030 due to the load. This 
is much wider than that of the 2015 envelope (solid blue 
line). Both of this lines, only represent how fast the load 
or demand for power changes in the system. The solid 
green line in Figure 31 shows the ramp requirements of 
the system in 2030 with VRE. This envelope is notably 
wider the other two. This means that under the REmap 
scenario, the power system would require much higher 
flexibility than that under the current system or in a 
future system with no VRE.
Three important conclusions can be drawn from this 
analysis. First, system operators and system planners 
need to take into account the following key elements: 
system has to be flexible enough to handle larger 
and more uncertain ramps; advanced forecasting 
algorithms are needed to reduce uncertainty in VRE 
power generation. Second, reserves are not the only 
means to add flexibility to the system. Storage units, fast 
ramping power plants and demand-side management 
are other options already commercially available. Future 
technologies may also emerge, and they need to be 
considered too. Third, a detailed and dedicated study 
to assess the flexibility of the system and the reserves 
allocation is advised.
Challenge 4: Adequacy of the transmission 
network
The optimal location in terms of availability of wind 
and solar resources does not necessarily coincide with 
high demand centres. This means that large-scale VRE 
projects may bring changes in the amount and direction 
of power flows within the transmission system.
The REmap Options for the power sector include 
additions of 1 453 MW of onshore wind power capacity, 
871 MW of utility-scale PV, 665 MW of distributed 
on-grid PV, 91 MW of small hydropower, 149 MW of 
biogas and landfill gas, 49 MW of bagasse-based power 
generation and 70 MW of biomass co-firing.
According to the Worldwatch Institute (2011) resource 
assessment, the locations with the highest potential for 
wind power are in the northern, southern and eastern 
provinces of the country (see map in Figure 34). These 
regions, with high wind resources, are a significant 
distance from the main load centres, which are located 
in the central region and in Santiago.
Harnessing energy from remote locations may 
require the construction of new transmission lines 
and reinforcements in other parts of the transmission 
system. This new infrastructure or reinforcements 
have to be carefully planned to maximise the 
utilisation and intrinsic benefits of renewable energy 
technologies. The expansion and reinforcements in 
the transmission network also have to take into 
account increasing demand and the reliability and 
power quality criteria defined in the country’s 
legislation. National and international experience has 
demonstrated that expanding transmission networks 
could take several years (in average around 5 to 
10 years). It is therefore important to plan and start 
expanding the network before it is actually fully 
required. Anticipating sites for development (grid 
expansion) when no committed projects exist has its 
risks. It is beyond the scope of this report to try to 
asses these risks in the Dominican Republic. However, 
different solutions around the world exist. One 
example is the Electric Reliability Council of Texas 
(ERCOT), which decided to invest in grid expansion 
to achieve high wind potential. ERCOT expects the 
private sector to invest and build wind farms on these 
sites (ERCOT, 2008).
A simplified assessment of the power transfer 
capacities required to evacuate potential wind and 
solar generation was conducted for this report. This 
illustrates the potential impact of the REmap Options 
on transmission system utilisation and needs. The 
assessment concentrated on the required transmission 
capacity and did not include a detailed representation 
of the electricity network. It excluded different voltage 
levels in the system and potential stability problems. 
The intention of this study is not to replace a detailed 
power system simulation but rather to identify potential requirements to increase the capacity of electricity 
transmission within the country.
This simple transmission system adequacy analysis 
identifies maximum capacities that may be required 
by the system in 2030, in order to be able transport 
all wind and solar generation to the load centres, with 
acceptable levels of curtailment due to congestions.
To carry out the analysis, the transmission system was 
aggregated according to current operational areas 
and sub-areas. Each node of the aggregated network 
represents a sub-area of the system (as in Figure 11). 
Trough load duration curves of the net load for each 
sub-area (projected to 2030 according to expected 
regional load growth and generation expansion), 
statistical significant, possible exchanges of power 
between areas and required transmission capacities 
were identified along with potential curtailment.
In previous sections, curtailment has been considered 
only in relation to instantaneous VRE penetration 
at a system level. In this section, curtailment of VRE 
is assumed to be caused by network congestion or 
limitations. Curtailment under these circumstances 
competes with the cost of expanding the grid. Full costbenefit analysis methodologies should be employed to 
find the optimal solution.
The location of the renewable energy projects in the 
REmap scenario originated from a Worldwatch Institute 
study which detected sites with most wind and solar 
potential (2011). All these projects were allocated in 
an electrical node on the aggregated transmission 
network. Table 13 shows where the projects are located 
geographically and electrically (see also Figure 34).
After locating the projects and allocating them an 
electrical sub-area, the local residual demand for each

Based on Worldwatch Institute data (2015); background map from d-maps (n.d.)node (sub-area) was obtained. Figure 35 shows the 
net load of the four outermost sub-areas in the country 
(in terms of distance to the load centres). As seen in 
the figure, the sub-areas are characterised by low local 
demand and high VRE generation. Positive numbers in 
the plot represent excess power while negative numbers 
signify a need to import power into the node.
Excess local VRE generation translates to a need to 
export power to another region or node. It occurs about 
70% of the time for Sur Profundo and over 90% of the 
time for the Norte Noroeste and Norte P. Plata subareas. This means that the sub-areas would essentially 
need to evacuate most of their power production. The 
expansion of the network or required capacity has to

against the cost of expanding the network. However, 
this cost comparison is beyond the scope of the present 
analysis.
As an illustration, the Sur Profundo sub-area (Figure 35 
top left) is further analysed. According to the current 
transmission restriction analysis from OC-SENI, the 
sub-area transmission capacity is 45 MW (EIRGRID 
and SONI, 2016a). This means that under the REmap 
scenario and with no expanded network transmission 
capacity, VRE curtailment locally would be in the 
order of 55%. This would mean 730 GWh of clean 
power could not be utilised in the system. This level of 
curtailment would take place even if no other power 
plants were running. This is an optimistic scenario 
because conventional power plants may be required 
for reliability (instantaneous penetration) and local 
voltage regulation. This analysis clearly reveals the 
need to expand the grid in three of the four sub-areas 
analysed.
The South area was also further analysed (see Figure 36). 
This area can currently transfer a maximum 345 MW to 
the Central region (OC-SENI, 2015c). At current power 
transfer limits, VRE would have to be curtailed about 
7% of the time even without considering that other 
power plants might be needed for reliability and other 
reasons. Again, this signals the requirement to expand 
the overall capacity to transfer power from the South 
area to the Central sub-area, the location predicted for 
most electricity consumption in 2030.
This simple assessment demonstrates the need to expand 
the electrical transmission network to accommodate and 
transfer power from the sites with the highest potential 
to demand centres. The South area, together with 
the Sur Profundo, Norte Noroeste, and Norte P. Plata 
sub-areas have been identified as locations for possible 
transmission capacity expansion. Current transmission 
expansion plans are based on the scenario from 2012. If 
REmap options were to be realised, it may be necessary 
to update these expansion plans.

Current transmission limit
Note: Curtailment of VRE power can occur due to several reasons (including technical, and regulatory factors). These reasons could co-exist 
at the same time (e.g. a limit due to network congestion, another due to instantaneous penetration, the existence of long-term contracts).
In the assessment of these technical challenges, only two reasons for VRE curtailment were considered. The first is due to the maximum 
instantaneous penetration level of non-synchronous generation, which is related to the stability of the gird, and the presence of fast 
frequency balance technologies. The second, is the presence of congestions at the transmission electrical network. There are technical 
solutions to both these limiting factors (e.g. state-of-the-art operating practices, strict and forward-looking grid codes, incentivising thermal 
plants to work as must-run or back-up power plants, and electrical network expansion). The optimal solution is system specific requires 
in-depth analysis and dedicated studies.4.2 End-use sectors
In the Reference Case, much renewable energy is 
deployed in the power sector although direct uses of 
renewables for heating, cooling and cooking also present 
interesting opportunities to replace non-renewable 
energy carriers. The biggest challenge is to make policy 
makers and users aware of the renewables potential in 
end-use sectors and to implement appropriate solutions 
and policies that realise this potential.
The rest of this section describes the main opportunities 
and key action areas for the successful deployment of 
renewables in end-use applications.
Industry
Industry in the Dominican Republic is dominated by 
industrial processes based on low-temperature steam, 
mainly in the food and beverage industry. Industry 
is also populated by a large number of micro and 
Table 14: REmap findings on direct uses of renewables in industry, 2030
REmap findings Action areas
Bioenergy
● Bioenergy (including renewable waste) can provide industrial process heat 
at all temperatures and scales but is not a straightforward option. In the 
case of the Dominican Republic, bioenergy can be easily integrated to the 
production processes of food, chemicals, and other small and medium scale 
industries that require low to medium process heat temperatures. In that 
respect, CHP can be a favourable option to produce also on-site electricity 
to meet auxiliary and motor drive needs. Its use in other sectors mean there 
is competing demand for this limited resource. Sufficient onsite storage is 
required as biomass feedstocks are seasonal, as is the case of bagasse. 
t Feedstock storage 
to ensure continuous 
daytime and harvesttime supply
● The sugar cane production yield is around 40 tonnes per hectare, which 
is half the global best practice achieved in Brazil today. Improvements 
in agricultural yields can make a significant contribution to feedstock 
availability, both considering the direct use of the feedstock (e.g. to produce 
conventional ethanol) or its residues (e.g. taking advantage of the higher 
amount of bagasse after sugar cane production).
t Increase sugar cane 
agricultural yield 
Solar heat
● As in many other countries, industry solar thermal energy use is not part 
of the national energy plans for 2030. REmap estimates that solar thermal 
energy can provide around 10%-15% of the low- (< 200°C) and mediumtemperature (200°C-450°C) process heat use in 2030. This equates to a 
total installed capacity of 85 MW supplying around 16 ktoe (0.7 PJ) of heat 
with conventional and CST installations.
● Given the continuous demand for heat, the design of the installations will 
need to include appropriate storage capacity. Hybrid solutions with fossil 
fuels can be another option.
● Many industrial processes require large amounts of heat, and many plants 
have limited space. This might create a problem for installing collectors 
covering a wide area. An alternative is to install them on the roof. Existing 
buildings would not usually accommodate this but it is a consideration 
for new buildings design and construction. Alternatively, CST is an option 
to optimise the use of available space as well as to raise process heat 
temperatures. REmap considers a 46 MW option for CST. Organised 
industry regions can create symbiosis between different plants within them, 
and this can to some extent resolve the space problem.

opportunities for deployment of renewables.
Energy costs are a substantial part of the industry 
sector’s overall expenditure. This is an issue in particular 
for small businesses with low operating budgets beyond 
the energy-intensive sectors. There is major potential 
for solar thermal and bioenergy systems in small-scale 
plants and less energy-intensive industries like food 
and beverages, textile or some chemical installations. 
Most enterprises in the Dominican Republic fall under 
these categories. A share of the energy used for heat 
generation in many of the low-temperature processes 
in REmap is therefore easily supplied by solar and 
bioenergy.

Liquid biofuels
● Around 100 000 hectares of appropriate land are available for sustainable 
sugar cane harvesting and could be dedicated to liquid biofuel production 
(i.e. without affecting sugar cane for food production). This represents 
less than 30% of the total arable land for sugar cane production. Given 
that enough land is available, ethanol uptake is a potential consideration 
and could supply a significant share of transport energy demand. Current 
national plans do not yet take this into account.
● In REmap, conventional ethanol use in road transport reaches 173 million 
litres in 2030. Assuming that production yields remain at today’s levels, 
this would imply cultivating around 50 000 hectares of land for sugar 
cane production – equivalent to half the suitable land available for this 
purpose. A market for both biofuels demand and supply should be 
created to incentivise production.

● Bagasse remaining after industrial processes provides a significant 
opportunity for advanced biofuel production for the benefit both of local 
businesses and technology development. REmap estimates that at least 
19 million litres of advanced ethanol could be produced per year from 
bagasse.
t Accelerate production 
and research and 
development for 
advanced liquid biofuels
Electric mobility
● With growing urbanisation and demand for mobility, a large market for 
electric mobility could open up, especially in major cities such as Santo 
Domingo, Santiago de los Caballeros, La Romana. National energy 
projections do not include electric mobility estimates for road transport. 
REmap proposes electric mobility penetration amounting to 2% of road 
vehicle energy demand in terms of distance. This represents 9.6 billion 
passenger-kilometres.
● Battery electric and plug-in-hybrid electric car estimates in REmap 
would replace cars fuelled by petrol. This would amount to around 4% 
and 10% of total vehicle stock in 2030 respectively (220 000 vehicles).
● There is an opportunity for the early introduction of two- and threewheelers in major urban areas and beyond. This is motivated in particular 
by short distances, which means less need to recharge than for fourwheeled electric vehicles. This is also an attractive tourism option. REmap 
considers 375 000 two- and three-wheelers on the road in 2030.
● REmap suggests that battery electric buses used for urban public 
transportation could form a fleet of 1 100 out of 19 000 units in 2030.

REmap findings Action areas
Solar water heating
● Solar energy use in the Dominican Republic’s residential sector today 
covers around 12% of energy demand for water heating. In the Reference 
Case this would increase to 17% in 2030. Given that solar water heaters 
are already cost-effective their actual potential is largely overlooked.
● Water heating accounts for one-fifth of energy demand in the 
commercial, public and service sectors. This stays stable in the period 
to 2030. The Reference Case includes 10% of this demand supplied 
with solar water heaters in 2030 but there is potential to exceed this 
proportion. REmap proposes to replace LPG meeting 35% of energy 
demand for hot water in 2030. This would imply deploying around 
775 000 m2 of solar water heater capacity.
● The economic development expectations in the Dominican Republic are 
reflected in building stock expansion. To fulfil the additional potential 
for residential solar water heating in REmap in 2030, it suffices to install 
solar water heaters in 35% of new households constructed in 2017-2030. 
This is three times current levels.
● Solar water heating is particularly competitive in middle- and highincome households given that they desire more hot water than lowincome households. They also find this more affordable. By contrast, 
low-income households may need financial support to adopt this 
technology.

Solar space cooling
● Solar space cooling has been overlooked in energy projections in most 
countries across the world yet some technologies could already offer 
competitive alternatives to electricity use for air conditioning. Cooling 
energy demand represents 25% of energy use in urban households and 
more than 45% in commercial buildings.
● The Reference Case ignores renewable cooling. Under REmap, 20% of 
cooling demand in buildings would be supplied by solar thermal cooling 
installations. These would cover around 500 000 m2.
● REmap estimates that 6% of cooling demand is equivalent to more than 
200 000 PV rooftop installations.

Modern bioenergy cooking
● Tourism is growing in the Dominican Republic so there is an opportunity 
to develop waste-to-energy technologies for different applications. 
REmap proposes a minor option to make use of organic waste arising 
from the hospitality sector to produce biogas in anaerobic digesters.
● REmap considers the integration of 100 biogas systems in hotels 
(80-100 cubic meters – m3 – size). It is assumed that the biogas produced 
is used for cooking but it could also be used for other purposes e.g. for 
water heating. A business case exists for such applications. However, 
limited experience of the technology means the hospitality sector needs 
to improve its understanding of the opportunity and benefits of biogas.
t Raise governmental 
and public awareness of 
renewables opportunities
t Energy planning and 
strategies
t Building codes and 
designpotential of energy crops (such as sugar cane) is limited 
so the appropriate pathways need to be moulded to 
avoid interfering with land and water use for food and 
feed production.
The alternative to biofuels is electric mobility sourced 
with renewable power. This requires a policy effort 
for both electric vehicle deployment and modal shift, 
thereby changing consumer behaviour as well as 
investing in infrastructure. Electric two- and threewheelers present an early opportunity for major urban 
areas in the Dominican Republic and beyond. This is 
because distances are short, and the need to recharge 
is lower than for four-wheeled electric vehicles.
Buildings
Although energy plans currently include some 
renewables development, the vast potential of direct 
renewables use in buildings is not fully integrated in the 
long-term vision. This omission could become a major 
issue considering that most renewable technologies 
that can be used for heating, cooling or cooking are 
more sustainable and cost-effective than non-renewable 
alternatives.
The following table summarises the main findings on 
renewables development relating to REmap estimates 
in the buildings sector.
The major potential for renewables use in direct 
applications in buildings could both decrease consumer 
energy bills and increase the renewables share in the 
energy mix.
Key action areas for renewable energy use in 
end-use sectors
To ensure renewables are successfully integrated in 
the years ahead, a number of obstacles need to be 
overcome. They include high initial investment costs 
for renewable installations, fossil fuel subsidies, high 
interest rates, limited access to financing for equipment 
purchase, lack of end-user confidence in the technology 
and few experienced installers. Law 57-07 already 
incentivises renewable technologies in end-use sectors, 
in buildings through exemptions on import duties for 
solar thermal components or collectors, for example, 
but further efforts are needed.
Based on the findings of each of the sectors described 
above and considering the additional potential identified 
in REmap, the key areas for government and policy 
maker attention are explained in further detail below. 
Some of them are relevant for more than one end-use 
sector, while others are sector-specific. This will provide 
a platform for the major adoption of direct uses of 
renewables.
Cross-sectoral
● More ambitious representation of renewable 
technology options in end-use sector energy 
planning. It is necessary to include realistic 
but ambitious estimates in the projections of 
renewable energy use in all end-use sectors. 
This means the strategies accompanying energy 
plans can be shaped with the aim of achieving a 
higher share of renewables. The establishment 
of targets is a possible complementary measure.
● Improve public education and awareness of 
the economics and direct uses of renewable 
technologies. Many end-users and local industry 
stakeholders currently have limited awareness of 
the benefits and economics of renewables. Yet 
the building sector is the largest energy user after 
transport and numerous benefits could arise from 
renewables use. These include energy bill savings 
and reduced air pollution in urban settlements. 
To harness the renewable potential by 2030, the 
Dominican Republic should consider promoting 
further educational and training initiatives. This 
would improve the understanding of renewables 
opportunities particularly of solar and biomass 
technologies for household, commercial and 
industrial applications.
● Reactivate sugar cane production land and 
increase agricultural yields. Some years 
ago, sugar cane was cultivated on around 
350 000 hectares of Dominican Republic land 
(Instituto Interamericano de Cooperación para 
la Agricultura, 2007). However, sugar cane 
production has declined significantly so today 
only around 100 000 hectares of land are used 
for this purpose. Given the vast experience of the 
sugar industry, the unused arable land presents 
an opportunity to decrease dependency on imported transport fuels and boost activity in 
the sector. 
Improvements in agricultural yields can make a 
significant contribution to feedstock availability, 
both considering the direct use of the feedstock 
(e.g. to produce conventional ethanol) or its 
residues (e.g. taking advantage of the higher 
amount of bagasse after sugar cane production). 
The low sugar cane production yields also offer 
a major opportunity for improvement. However, 
this needs to be realised sustainably without 
resulting in increased water stress, excessive 
fertiliser application etc.
● Include urban planning and promote renewable 
energy at the municipal level to adopt it more 
rapidly through local action. As population and 
economic growth accelerate urbanisation, city 
demand for clean, reliable and affordable energy 
will increase exponentially. Significant urban 
planning efforts are therefore key to integrating 
more renewables in heating and cooling and also 
electric mobility. Local governments, at state or 
municipality level, can play an important role 
here by encouraging, enabling and regulating the 
increased uptake of renewable energy. Even cities 
that do not directly control power generation have 
options to drive clean energy use, e.g. supporting 
low-carbon transportation solutions including 
the implementation of charging stations (IRENA, 
2016f). As managers of local infrastructure, cities 
and local governments can develop solutions 
that integrate renewable energy (IRENA, 2016a) 
and can set an example by integrating renewable 
technologies into public buildings. All this needs 
to be held together by sound national policy and 
planning with common goals and enforcement 
mechanisms.
● Build a solid industry along the entire 
renewable technology value chain with high 
expertise and quality assurance to help develop 
successful renewable markets. Manufacturers, 
system designers, distributors and installers need 
to have enough expertise and quality compliance 
in the use, installation and maintenance of 
renewable technologies. This too will enable 
direct renewables to thrive. Government can 
support this by defining standards, certification 
and control mechanisms, which will ensure that 
renewable installations are fully functional and 
reach their optimal efficiency. This is needed to 
retain the interest and trust of end-users in these 
technologies and sustain market development.
Barbados is a success story in the development 
of direct uses of renewables, particularly in 
solar thermal applications. By 2009, almost 
half the island’s homes had water heating 
systems (Energy Transition Initiative, 2015; 
UN Environment Programme, n.d.). Some key 
measures included programmes to improve 
local skills of solar water heating technicians and 
financial incentives such as low-interest loans 
aimed at manufacturers.
Industry
● Sufficient feedstock storage to ensure 
continuous daytime and harvest-time supply. 
Bioenergy (including renewable waste) can 
provide industrial process heat at all temperatures 
and scales but is not a straightforward option. Its 
use in other sectors means there is competing 
demand for this limited resource, and supply 
logistics can be difficult. Sufficient onsite storage 
is required, and in many cases customised 
solutions are needed. This is particularly 
important because most industry plants have 
a continuous need for energy to produce heat. 
By contrast, biomass feedstocks are seasonal. 
Bagasse, one of the main residues exploited in 
the Dominican Republic, is one example.
Transport
● Develop electric vehicle infrastructure. It is 
important to develop the necessary infrastructure 
to enable the uptake of electric vehicles and to 
account for the role of electric mobility coupled 
with electricity generation based on renewables 
in energy system planning. Charging points need 
to be readily accessible to make electric vehicles 
an attractive option. On the other hand, charging 
stations will not be an attractive investment 
until more electric vehicles create the necessary 
demand for infrastructure (IRENA, 2016a). 
Infrastructure development plays a significant 
role in raising the number of early adopters and 
could be one way to achieve a breakthrough. Increasing home, public, and workplace charging 
options is crucial. In addition to charging point 
expansion, charging needs to be rapid (IRENA, 
2016a). However, this is likely to be a minor 
concern in the Dominican Republic because 
vehicles cover fairly short distances, making this 
an opportunity for electric vehicle deployment.
● Open up an avenue for advanced biofuels. 
Given the opportunity to use excess bagasse 
from industrial applications, the Dominican 
Republic could develop expertise in advanced 
biofuels production. This will be critical in 
the long term because there are limits to the 
production of land-intensive conventional 
biofuels. Bioenergy waste streams arising from 
industrial applications should also be utilised for 
advanced liquid biofuels production. However, 
this means developing technology and creating 
finance resources for advanced biofuels capacity, 
which up until now has been subject to only 
limited commercial development.
Buildings
● Embed codes and standards that integrate 
renewable technologies in buildings 
construction or renovation and make them 
part of urban development. The Dominican 
Republic is a country with growing population 
and energy demand. It is thus in a good position 
to integrate renewables in the residential and 
commercial segments since it is easier to 
build for renewable energy use than to retrofit 
(IRENA, 2016a). Renewables can ride on this 
growth if measures are introduced to stimulate 
their use in the construction and renovation 
of buildings. Examples include command and 
control mechanisms such as building codes and 
technology standards or incentives such as lower 
interest loans or end-user fiscal incentives. When 
promoting renewables in buildings, the whole 
range of technology options should be considered. 
Examples include different arrangements and 
types of solar thermal collectors for heating and 
cooling, anaerobic digesters producing methane 
for cooking or water heating and PV panels for 
electricity production.
● Optimise the use of building space available 
for renewable installations. One factor to 
take into account when different renewable 
technologies are proposed is the optimal use 
of rooftop and other available spaces to install 
different technologies. This is essential, especially 
in cities rising vertically such as Santo Domingo. 
Maximising buildings-integrated PV at the same 
time is another possibility.

taken up by PV rooftop applications. Even with all 
this potential installed, only 5% of total available 
rooftop in the Dominican Republic in 2030 would 
be covered by a renewable energy installation.
● Provide accessible financial options for 
households to purchase renewable energy 
technologies. The widespread use of modern 
renewables requires new programmes making 
modern renewable technologies (solar water 
heaters, efficient cook stoves, solar cooling, PV 
installations etc.) more affordable to low-income 
households. This could be complemented by 
other types of economic or fiscal support. In 
remote areas, this will also be a key to modern 
and universal energy access. These can take the 
form of government initiatives but also presents 
opportunities for other stakeholders, including 
the private sector. Many schemes could be 
designed to fund and/or support households in 
acquiring renewable energy technology.
4.3 Bioenergy market development
A breakdown of primary energy use in the Dominican 
Republic is shown in Figure 38. The Reference Case 
sees a total annual demand of 42 PJ bioenergy in 2030. 
Buildings, power generation and industry each account 
for approximately a third of total demand in the country. 
There are changes to the sector mix of total demand 
in REmap. Following the decline in traditional use of 
bioenergy, the buildings share of total demand falls 
below 10%, which in absolute terms halves total demand. 
The share of transport and power generation in total 
bioenergy demand increases significantly; demand for 
power generation doubles and for transport increases 
by over 500% compared to the Reference Case.
According to IRENA estimates, annual primary 
bioenergy supply could amount to 38-84 PJ. More than 
three-quarters of this total derives from agricultural 
residues and waste. Potential for energy crops and 
forestry products is rather limited.
Industry and power generation will be the main source 
of demand for agricultural harvesting and processing 
residues. Biogas and municipal solid waste will be used 
to a great extent by the power generation sector (landfill 
gas) and for cooking in buildings. This is also where 
forestry products (e.g. charcoal) for modern cook stoves 
will be used. To a great extent, the transport sector will 
rely on sugar cane for conventional ethanol production. 
A small share of demand will be met by bagasse, a 
harvesting residue, for advanced ethanol production. 
Finally, feedstocks for minor biodiesel production will 
be imported.
There is a potential to meet demand according to the 
high end of the supply (according to IRENA estimates 
shown in Table 7) with limited reliance on imports. 
However, mobilising feedstock supply will not be easy. 
Markets for bioenergy will need to be created to realise

66 PJ/yrthis potential, implying a dual policy effort in supply on 
the one hand and demand on the other.
Three main challenges need to be overcome in relation 
to demand:
1) Traditional uses of bioenergy: in the Reference 
Case, demand is already very close to the low end 
of the supply range (as shown in Table 7) so that 
it can technically be met with local resources. 
However, the outcome is alarming when demand 
and supply are compared at the feedstock level. 
Buildings require 14 PJ of bioenergy in total of 
which 10 PJ is traditional uses of bioenergy for 
cooking. Total volume of forestry product supply 
is 3 PJ – significantly lower than the bioenergy 
demand for cooking. This points to potential 
deforestation in a country with already limited 
forest resources. Furthermore, traditional uses of 
bioenergy often result in indoor air pollution, a 
major cause of premature death.
Under REmap Options, demand for bioenergy 
in buildings declines significantly, and the 
traditional uses of bioenergy are replaced either 
by its modern forms or LPG. Modern forms of 
bioenergy include charcoal and biogas. According 
to REmap estimates, production for charcoal 
needs to more than double compared today’s 
level. Biogas digesters are not used at present 
and need to be introduced into rural areas.
Substituting traditional uses of bioenergy by 
modern forms of energy makes a significant 
impact on sustainability when their hidden costs 
(e.g. collection time) are also considered. In 
addition, it reduces household air pollution.
Hence improvements are needed in the efficiency 
of conversion technologies and appliances 
currently used with traditional bioenergy as well 
as in charcoal production for clean cook stoves 
and cooking.
2) Liquid biofuel use in transport sector: transport 
is the other major challenge. IRENA’s estimate 
is conservative in terms of the supply potential 
of energy crops (sugar cane) amounting to 
around 6 PJ. This represents around 40 000 
hectares of land use per year (based on average 
ethanol yield of 3 460 litres per hectare). As 
observed in Section 4.2, 100 000 hectares of 
land could be used for sugar cane production 
without disturbing food/feed production. 
Assuming this land is used, total conventional 
ethanol supply is doubled – and it is the main 
technology for increasing the renewables share in 
transportation. Bagasse used to make advanced 
biofuels increases the renewables share in the

Harvesting residuesector. To date, advanced biofuels production in 
the region is low, as in the rest of the world. The 
production costs of these fuels are much higher 
than their conventional equivalents.
A small market for liquid biofuel use already 
exists in the transport sector. A market needs to 
be created through blending mandates and/or 
volumetric targets by taking into account the 
projected growth in the sector’s demand for total 
energy. Law 57-07 in chapter V on the special 
regime of biofuels, already lays down the first 
foundations for incentives for biofuels production 
and for blending non-renewable fuels with liquid 
biofuels to 2020. Since the legal framework 
is already in place, CNE should next gradually 
introduce blending mandates to encourage the 
formation of the market. Depending on how 
markets evolve, incentives could be expanded 
beyond 2020.
Up until now, there has been limited production 
of advanced biofuels, and its increase requires 
more than blending targets. Research and 
development support and technology innovation 
will be key to accelerating deployment of the 
most cost-effective routes of production. The 
sustainability aspects of biofuels need to be 
taken into consideration when creating the 
market. This will mean not just meeting a 
target but also deploying the most resourceeffective pathways with the least intensive GHG 
emissions.
3) Creating a market for industrial heating and 
power generation: industrial heating and 
power generation are the two largest markets 
after transport for bioenergy in the Dominican 
Republic. Bioenergy is a readily available 
alternative to fossil fuels to generate process 
heat at various temperature levels. The main 
issues in the industry sector include the need for 
continuous bioenergy supply to run processes, 
and space to store feedstocks. However, lowtemperature and some medium-temperature 
processes can also be supplied with energy from 
non-bioenergy renewables. Examples include 
solar thermal, geothermal or heat pumps if a 
resource is available.
The Dominican Republic already benefits from 
rich solar, wind and geothermal resources to 
supply renewable electricity. Given limited 
bioenergy availability and competition from 
other sectors, bioenergy is not the first choice. 
However, bioenergy combusted to generate both 
heat and electricity in CHP plants can be viable. 
Power plants fired by bioenergy are dispatchable 
like their fossil fuel counterparts and can 
contribute to baseload power generation.
As a first step, demand needs to be created by setting 
targets that can make use of the synergies from 
bioenergy for medium- and high-temperature process 
heat, dispatchable power and transport fuels. This means 
accounting for feedstock seasonality and prioritising 
the development of the most resource-effective, least 
emission-intensive and most cost-effective bioenergy 
pathways across all end-use sectors.
The main supply-side challenges relate to mobilising 
a continuous supply of affordable and sustainable 
bioenergy feedstocks. A significant share of bioenergy 
supply in the country will originate from agricultural 
residues and waste. These feedstocks are sustainable 
but typically not collected and currently have no market. 
A collection and recovery system should be developed 
while maintaining sustainability criteria. Sugar cane 
yields should be improved to reach levels in advanced 
countries. The Dominican Republic surface area is small, 
and import dependency will be limited. Nevertheless, 
a strong logistics system will be required to distribute 
feedstocks across the country to conversion plants and 
end-users.
Agriculture is one of the main economic activities in the 
Dominican Republic so experience and channels exist. 
These can be developed on the basis of the existing 
market for energy crops. For instance, some sugar mills 
also cultivate and trade other energy crops used to feed 
process heat in industry on land not suited to sugar 
cane production. This may be a minor activity today but 
could be easily expanded.
To ensure supply, it will be necessary to harvest farm 
residues along with post-consumer waste and create a 
supply market and logistics system across the country. 
This must be affordable as well as stable when local 
harvests fluctuate.5.1 Investment needs
Total annual average investment needed in renewable 
energy technology deployment in 2016-2030 (i.e. capital 
investment in renewable capacity for power generation 
and end-use sectors) amounts to USD 695 million (see 
Table 15). USD 245 million is required each year to fulfil 
the Reference Case, and an extra USD 450 million 
per year would be needed to implement the REmap 
Options.38
Most of the additional investment39 is needed for the 
power sector (USD 344 million per year) as shown 
in Table 15, especially wind (USD 155 million per year, 
shown in Figure 40). Bioenergy technologies (including 
the capacity to produce liquid biofuels and biomethane 
for transport) also require an extra USD 105 million each 
year beyond the Reference Case. Bioenergy for heating 
technologies in industry (process heat) and buildings 
(mainly for cooking) will require additional investments 
of USD 56 million per year on average. Investment in 
solar heating and cooling systems will require a total 
annual average of USD 34 million.
38 These costs exclude infrastructure (e.g. additional generation 
or transmission capacity in the power sector or electric vehicle 
charging stations) and enabling technology costs (e.g. grid 
integration).
39 Additional investment needs represent the difference between 
investments needed in the REmap case and the Reference Case.
5.2 Costs of renewables in the 
Dominican Republic
Table 16 provides an overview of substitution costs by 
sector for 2030 based on the business and government 
perspectives. National prices are based on a discount 
rate of 12% and take into account energy tax and 
subsidies in energy prices in the Dominican Republic. 
International prices are based on a discount rate of 10% 
and exclude tax and subsidies in energy prices.
In both the business and government perspective, most 
of the industry and buildings options are cost-effective 
(except modern uses of solid biomass and SWAC in 
the business perspective). In the power sector 90% of 
the renewable energy supplied with REmap Options 
is cost-effective. This is a result of the country’s high 
dependency on expensive oil product imports.38 All 
power sector REmap Options substitute oil products 
and coal but even when PV or wind technologies are 
compared with natural gas generation, they are still 
cost-competitive.40
40 The estimated levelised cost of energy (LCOE) in this study for 2030 
is USD 0.075-0.09/kWh for onshore wind, USD 0.055-0.08/kWh 
for utility-scale PV and USD 0.14-0.18/kWh for natural gas power 
generation.

Transport 1 + 12 = 13Using the small amounts of bioenergy and waste from 
industrial processes to generate process heat as well as 
solar process heat is a cost-effective option.
In the government perspective, the average cost of substituting the selected technology options in each sector 
is lower than in the business case. This is explained by 
the exclusion of taxes and subsidies from energy prices.
Figure 41 and Figure 42 rank the costs of each REmap 
Option and show its contributions to the increased share 
of renewable energy. Table 17 shows the substitution 
costs of REmap Options in 2030 for the Dominican 
Republic (the same information as plotted in the two 
figures). The option cost ranges from USD -72/GJ to as 
high as USD +103/GJ in the government perspective. The 
business perspective starts off with options costing as 
low as USD -110/GJ and ends with options as expensive 
as USD +42/GJ. In both cases, over 80% of the energy 
from these options is cost-competitive and therefore 
incurs a negative substitution cost.
Most of the bioenergy technologies in the business 
perspective experience low substitution costs and would 
generate savings when compared to the petroleum 
product alternative. Onshore wind, cogeneration with 
bagasse, landfill gas generation and decentralised PV 
incur the lowest substitution cost for on-grid power 
generation. Solar heaters and coolers in industry and 
buildings are cost-competitive. This is explained by 
their low capital costs and the expensive petroleum 
products or electricity used as an alternative. In the 
transport sector, battery electric two- or three-wheelers 
and public buses are the cheapest REmap Option in 
the business perspective. This is due to the substitution 
of costly conventional fuels. Conventional biofuels

5.3 Benefits of REmap Options
Figure 43 shows primary energy supply trends 
in 2010-2030 in the Dominican Republic under the 
Reference Case and REmap. REmap Options would cut 
fossil fuel demand by 21% compared to the fossil fuel 
consumption in the Reference Case. The savings range 
from 19% for oil products to 34% for coal.
Total oil demand in REmap would be close to 2010 
levels. By comparison, coal rises 230% in Remap in 
2010-2030 (compared to 400% rise in the Reference 
Case over the same period). Likewise, total renewable 
energy supply in REmap grows about 240% over the 
same period (compared to 65% in the Reference Case).
The bottom-up CO2 emissions estimate of sectors 
covered in this analysis amounts to 20 million Mt CO2 per 
year in 2010 (or 2 tonnes CO2 per capita per year).41 In 
the Reference Case, total energy related CO2 emissions 
in the Dominican Republic increase to 35 million tonnes 
in 2030 (or 2.9 tonnes CO2 per capita). This is an 
alarming result, given that GHG emission reduction 
targets in the country’s INDC is 25% by 2030, compared 
with 3.6 tonnes CO2 equivalent per capita in 2010. This 
implies that total GHG emissions in 2030 should be at 
a level of 2.7 tonnes CO2 equivalent per capita (for all 
sectors including energy). Therefore, energy related 
CO2 emissions alone are already above the total GHG 
objective under the Reference Case developments.
41 For this same year, total energy related GHG emissions amount to 
2.5 tonnes CO2 per capita.If all REmap Options identified in this study are put in 
place, total CO2 emissions reduce to 27 million tonnes 
(or 2.3 tonnes CO2 per capita). This is 23% lower than the 
Reference Case in 2030 (or an annual absolute volume 
of 8 million tonnes CO2), as shown in Figure 44. These 
reductions would be an important step in meeting GHG 
emission reduction targets in the country’s INDC.
The power sector accounts for around 70% of that 
total mitigation potential. Meeting these emission 
reduction targets and making greater reductions 
means accelerating renewables deployment and energy 
efficiency measures to reach the emissions target 
reduction by 2030.
Table 17 shows a number of financial indicators for the 
Dominican Republic. The package of REmap Options 
for industry, buildings and power sectors would already 
result in annual savings of USD 1 billion in 2030 from the 
substitution of non-renewable technologies and fuels. 
The power sector shows the greatest potential for cost 
reductions with this particular energy mix. The transport 
sector REmap Options would be implemented for less 
than USD 190 million per year.
Reduced externalities from avoided CO2 and air pollutant 
emissions estimated in this roadmap42 also yield 
savings. Externalities related to air pollution (impacts 
on human health and agriculture) result on savings of 
USD 0.9-3.5 billion per year. Furthermore, at an assumed 
42 The five air pollutants assessed include ammonia, mono-nitrogen 
oxides, particulate matter, sulphur dioxide and volatile organic 
compounds.

carbon price of USD 17-80 per tonne, related externalities 
could save USD 0.2-0.8 billion each year.
When accounting for the savings derived from the 
substitution of non-renewable technologies and 
reduced externalities, total annual savings could amount 
to USD 2.1 billion-5.3 billion per year43.
If the REmap Options are analysed individually, some 
result in savings and others incur additional costs. REmap 
Options incurring additional costs require economic 
support, which amounts to less than USD 120 million 
per year in 2030. This represents around 2% of the total 
potential savings in REmap.
43 The costs of renewables have been compared with the nonrenewable energy technologies assuming a relatively high growth 
in crude oil prices to 2030. This and the assessment of externalities 
has been carried out on the basis of standard parameters which 
may overestimate the savings in the island context.
Since the savings largely offset the costs, policy makers 
should also consider innovative measures which could 
help balance the potential of renewables offering 
savings in some technologies and sectors. This would 
support the implementation of the REmap Options 
incurring some extra costs when compared to the 
non-renewable substitute.
In addition, the REmap mix estimated for the Dominican 
Republic cuts fossil fuel imports. Simply introducing 
REmap Options substituting oil and coal products 
decreases annual fuel input by about 91 PJ (2 170 ktoe) 
and save up to USD 1.6 billion a year in fuel costs. About 
three-quarters of these savings correspond to electricity 
generation fuel savings.Table 19: Financial indicators for renewable energy use in Dominican Republic, government perspective

CO2 emissions Reduction in 2030 due to REmap Options
Reference Case emissions 35 Mt

reductionThis roadmap has shown that the Dominican Republic 
has the potential to raise its renewable energy share to 
27% by 2030. This would result in an annual consumption 
of 87 PJ (2 080 ktoe) of final renewable energy. About 
half this potential is in the power sector and the other 
half in the direct use of renewables in end-use sectors, 
namely heating, cooling and transport.
If the potential of technologies in REmap are 
implemented, the renewable energy share in the power 
sector reaches 44%. This is significantly higher than 
the 25% target in Law 57-07. In heating sectors, the 
renewable energy share can reach 43% and 41% for 
buildings and industry respectively. In transport, it could 
work out as high as 5.1%. Existing energy plans and 
targets in the Dominican Republic do not account for 
this potential, especially in end-use sectors.
In terms of technology mix, bioenergy has considerable 
potential to account for about half the total final energy 
mix because it can replace fossil fuels in different 
applications across the energy system. Most importantly, 
onshore wind and solar PV show exponential growth 
between now and 2030 with total installed generation 
capacities reaching 2.3 GW and 1.7 GW respectively. 
Their combined output would represent 25% of total 
electricity generation by 2030 meaning VRE would 
represent a considerable share of the country’s total 
power output.
Realising the renewable energy share estimated in this 
roadmap would require an average annual investment 
of USD 695 million between now and 2030. When these 
investments are annualised, and the annual operation, 
maintenance and fuel costs accounted for, renewables 
actually result in savings compared to the costs of nonrenewable energy technologies that they substitute. 
This energy mix yields a number of important benefits 
in 2030. CO2 emissions relating to energy could be 
reduced by up to 23% compared to the baseline level 
in the same year. This means only the accelerated 
deployment of renewables suggested by REmap 
provides the important step the Dominican Republic 
needs to fulfil its INDC. Moreover, renewables would 
improve the environment and reduce externalities 
related to the human health impacts of fossil fuel by 
USD 1.1-4.3 billion per year by 2030. Finally, the country’s 
fossil energy bill can be cut by USD 1.6 billion per year.
Fulfilling this potential raises a number of challenges. In 
this roadmap, challenges specific to the power sector 
and end-use sectors are separately identified.
In the power sector, the challenges fall mainly into 
institutional, economic and technical. Technical 
challenges include generation adequacy and flexibility, 
adequate electric grid development, management of 
variability, limited predictability of variable renewable 
power and management of instantaneous penetration 
levels for variable renewable power.
End-use challenges can be broadly categorised around 
limited consideration in planning and limited awareness 
of the major potential offered by renewable energy 
technologies. For bioenergy, it will be important to 
create markets and ensure affordable and reliable 
supply while maintaining sustainability.
As far as the Dominican Republic policy landscape is 
concerned, these are the high-level suggestions for 
dealing with the specific challenges described above:
● In light of the vision in REmap, establish clear 
and consistent renewable energy targets. 
Ensure they are consistent with other national 
energy strategies and a stable institutional and 
regulatory framework with the right financial 
incentives to attract renewables investments.
● Ensure enough dispatchable generation 
is available to provide the firm capacity and 
flexibility required by the power system. Design 
appropriate incentives for this purpose supported 
by updated generation expansion plans with 
intermediate targets.
● Align transmission planning with renewable 
energy targets and assess the cost and benefits 
6 SUGGESTIONS FOR ACCELERATING 
RENEWABLE ENERGY UPTAKEof grid expansion and other local balancing 
measures to efficiently manage possible grid 
congestion.
● Define measures in line with planning for 
renewable energy deployment and transmission 
capacity to guarantee economic levels of 
curtailment. Explore the feasibility of flexibility 
measures to manage it efficiently.
● Devise and introduce appropriate incentives 
and market mechanisms to promote a flexible 
power system able to handle the new operational 
conditions imposed by the expected high share 
of variable renewables.
● Define codes and standards for buildings 
construction and renovation that take account 
of renewables such as solar water heating and 
cooling. Integrate renewables into energy and 
urban planning to accelerate their uptake by 
ensuring cost-effective energy supply to the 
population.
● Plan and develop a strategy for renewables use 
in industry by paying particular attention to the 
technical/economic design, operational hours 
and temperatures of industrial processes.
● Create a market for liquid biofuels in transport 
and promote electric mobility in congested urban 
areas and touristic parts of the country. This 
market also needs to make use of synergies 
with the power sector and plan for related 
infrastructure and financing needs.
● Set targets for bioenergy use in applications 
lacking any other renewable energy alternative 
and where bioenergy creates added value to the 
system. Promote the uses of its most resourceefficient and cost-effective pathways to ensure 
sustainability.
This roadmap provides a detailed overview of the 
realistic potential of renewables in the Dominican 
Republic by 2030. Fulfilling the REmap Options 
by 2030 will require significant effort to plan the 
intermediate targets and measures to achieve them, 
particularly in the power sector. The findings of this 
roadmap thus need to be complemented by detailed 
technical and economic studies on operating and 
planning the interconnected systems containing a high 
share of VRE. 
IRENA looks forward to further supporting the energy 
transition in the Dominican Republic, particularly by 
conducting any studies necessary. This research will be 
needed to prepare for the integration of the large share 
of solar and wind energy identified in this analysis, as 
well as the possible impacts of REmap Options on the 
power market. All this is inscribed in the context of the

Commodity price projections were taken from the following:
● Commodity prices as a first point for determining price projections were based on a number of sources. 
These include data provided by local experts and CNE and the Latin American Energy Organisation (OLADE) 
database on energy prices and IRENA assessments from other countries in the region.
● Biomass prices provided by IRENA bioenergy supply and cost assessment.

44 The table provides the conversion efficiencies used when estimating primary energy. Primary energy is, for instance, crude oil and lumps of 
coal before conversion into the gasoline and electricity – the “final energy” – that reaches consumers. Different organisations use different 
ways to estimate primary energy. In the REmap analysis, the Physical Energy Content method is used. This method, employed by the IEA and 
Statistical Office of the European Union (EUROSTAT), renewable electricity (e.g., wind, solar PV and hydropower) and biofuels are counted in 
primary energy as they appear in the form of secondary energy (i.e., using a 100% efficiency to convert them into primary energy equivalents), 
while geothermal, CSP electricity and nuclear electricity are counted using average process efficiencies (e.g., 10-33%) to convert them into 
primary energy equivalents.ANNEX 4: RESOURCE MAPS FROM IRENAS GLOBAL ATLAS

(www.openstreetmap.org)
The maps shows Vaisala’s Global Solar Dataset 3 km with units in W/m² per day. Vaisala’s Global Solar Dataset 
provides average annual GHI at a 3 km spatial resolution. Average values are based on more than ten years of 
hourly GHI data. They are derived from actual, half-hourly, high-resolution visible satellite imagery observations via 
the broadband visible wavelength channel at a 2 arc minute resolution. Vaisala processed this information using a 
combination of in-house research and algorithms published in peer-reviewed scientific literature.

DTU Global Wind Atlas: onshore and 30 km offshore wind climate dataset accounting for high resolution terrain 
effects. The Global Wind Atlas provides a high resolution wind climatology at 50, 100 and 200 metre hub heights 
above the surface for the whole world (onshore and 30 km offshore). These layers have been produced using 
microscale modelling in the Wind Atlas Analysis and Application Program (WAsP). They capture small-scale spatial 
variability of wind speeds due to high-resolution orography (terrain elevation), surface roughness and surface 
roughness change effects. The layers shared through the IRENA Global Atlas are served at a 1 km spatial resolution.
