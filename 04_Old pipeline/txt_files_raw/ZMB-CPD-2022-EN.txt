Results and resources framework for Zambia (2023-2027) ………………………………………… 9I. UNDP within the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Cooperation Framework
1. Zambia is a stable democracy and landlocked lower middle-income country that 
experienced a deterioration in the economy with real gross domestic product (GDP) growth 
declining from an average annual rate of 5.4 per cent between 2010 and 2015 to 1.4 per cent
between 2016 and 2019.1 The decline was compounded by the reduction of fiscal space, 
COVID-19 pandemic, and humanitarian crises related to one of its worst droughts in 
decades.
2, 3 Foreign direct investment, as a percentage of GDP, declined from 2.4 per cent in 
2019 to -1.0 per cent in 2020 while public debt in the social sectors was more than 100 per
cent of GDP.4, 5 The impact of the pandemic and climate change have posed a grave threat to
the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Socioeconomic impact 
assessments of COVID-19 show that nearly six in ten households had their incomes reduced 
while 93 per cent of households reported an increase in food prices due to the pandemic.6
2. Zambia has the third highest level of income inequality in the world.7 While Human 
Development Index (HDI) value increased by 38.7 per cent from 0.421 to 0.584 between 
1990 and 2019, the HDI discounted for inequality losses of 31.3 per cent, thereby hampering
social and economic progress.8 Furthermore, Zambia ranked 137 out of 162 countries on the 
Gender Inequality Index with a value of 0.584 in 2019. In 2020, Labour Force Survey 
reported income inequality by gender where the monthly earnings of women are 14 per cent 
lower than that of men with the gap rising to 81 per cent in the informal sector where most 
of the labour force is concentrated.9 Youth represent two thirds of the population and have 
limited livelihoods opportunities with 52.8 per cent unemployed in 2020 or not receiving
education or training.10
3. The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) is higher in provinces furthest from the 
railway line, which are mostly rural (Western, Northern, Luapula and Eastern). The MPI is
above 0.321 compared to 0.085 for Lusaka and 0.124 for the Copperbelt.11 Multidimensional 
poverty will worsen as adverse effects of climate change impact the productive sectors of the 
economy like agriculture and mining, threatening the livelihoods of the poor (56.7 per cent 
women).
12 Adverse economic impacts linked to climate change are anticipated to cause a real 
GDP loss of $5.44 billion US dollars over the next few decades given Zambia’s dependency 
on hydropower, which accounts for 85 per cent of renewable and clean energy in the country
and given the limited access to other renewables.13 Natural resources such as timber, water 
and minerals are depleting due to high consumption and production patterns that do not 
address food waste or promotion of a circular economy.
4. Zambia successfully conducted its ninth general elections in August 2021, which ushered 
in a new president from the opposition party with an unprecedented 70.6 per cent voter 
turnout and record-breaking youth participation—this despite COVID-19 challenges and 
amidst political polarization and rising social tensions.

orgzm/retrieved 26 August 2021development. Women accounted for 15.2 per cent of the seats in the newly elected 
parliament.16 People living with disabilities accounted for 10.9 per cent of the population 
above 18 who continue to face stigmatization and discrimination when accessing basic social 
services. While the country experienced an annual reduction (22.1 per cent) in reported cases 
of gender-based violence (GBV) in 2021, it remains prevalent with 20,540 cases reported 
where 85 per cent were criminal cases.
17
5. Zambia mainstreamed the SDGs into the national planning framework with 75 per cent 
alignment of SDG targets in the Seventh National Development Plan (7NDP). However, 
progress on four SDGs cannot be tracked as the Voluntary National Report (VNR) identified 
a need to strengthen national statistical systems at national and subnational levels to establish 
integrated monitoring frameworks to measure progress made on achieving national 
development priorities.18
6. After extensive consultations, the new administration finalized the Eight National 
Development Plan (8NDP) on 30 April 2022. The five-year operational strategy outlines the 
country’s path towards the national vision of becoming “a prosperous middle-income nation 
by 2030.”
19 The 8NDP promotes economic transformation through job creation and inclusive 
development to eradicate poverty and inequality while promoting environmental 
sustainability. The UNDP country programme, under the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) for the period 2023-2027, will support 
this national agenda focused on inclusive and sustainable development. 
7. Anchored in the central promises central of agendas 2030 and 2063, the UNSDCF adopts 
a multidimensional approach in line with the 5P principles of the 2030 Agenda that focuses
on: (1) prosperity, where all people, especially the marginalized and vulnerable, benefit from 
a resilient economy and opportunities for decent jobs and livelihoods; (2) people, where all 
people, especially women, girls and vulnerable groups, have equal access to universal social 
services; (3) planet, where sustainable management and use of natural resources and 
environmental services improves resilience to climate shocks; (4) peace, where all people 
benefit from inclusive, accountable and transparent governance systems, and (5) partnerships, 
which is an enabling and cross-cutting contribution across all priorities. As such, the 
UNSDCF adopted the following statement representing the value proposition of the United 
Nations development system (UNDS) to address national development challenges: “By 2030, 
Zambia is a middle-income country that is just, resilient, and where people enjoy equitable, 
sustainable and shared prosperity.”
8. UNDP is uniquely positioned to contribute to the UNSDCF based on its comparative 
advantages and as evidenced by (1) the Independent Country Programme Evaluation (ICPE)
of its current programme where UNDP is a recognized and trusted partner of choice of the 
government, partners, and United Nations country team (UNCT) to accelerate SDG 
implementation by connecting and bringing to the table key stakeholders, (2) its ability to 
leverage established Global Policy Network (GPN), Accelerator Labs, regional hubs and 
country offices to access highly skilled expertise to develop innovative solutions for 
economic diversification, structural transformation, and resource mobilization for the SDGs, 
and (3) strong collaboration with national partners including civil society and the private
sector. Collaborative support from a diversified donor base and established joint-programmes
help center core areas of the UNDP mandate such as resilience, gender equality, development 
financing, and SDG monitoring.20
9. In implementing the recommendations from the ICPE, UNDP will strengthen its 
strategic position in the country by improving responsiveness to deal with critical national 
development priorities.
21 This country programme will also establish scalable innovative 
development solutions to accelerate inclusive economic transformation and improve

21 Ibidlivelihoods while enhancing accountability and transparency through support to the digital 
transformation of public service delivery. In addition, interventions will build on the UNDP 
track record as a Technical Lead of the UNDS socioeconomic response to COVID-19, and
achievements made by the current country programme on gender equality and GBV to 
formulate multidimensional strategies that address discrimination and lack of access to justice 
and basic social services for all, especially women and youth. 
II. Programme priorities and partnerships
10. Priorities set out in this country programme derive from both UNSDCF and 8NDP with
substantial consultations from national and cooperating partners, including civil society and 
the private sector. The programme also draws on beneficiary feedback in evaluation reports 
and from monitoring missions, thereby leveraging South-South cooperation opportunities.
22
11. In line with its Strategic Plan 2022-2025, UNDP adopts an integrated people-centred
approach that recognizes the interconnection of the prosperity-peace-planet nexus in
contributing to the UNSDCF by deploying the following overarching theory of change: 
(planet) IF sustainable natural resources management capacities are strengthened; IF public
and private sector solutions promoting energy diversification and universal access are 
developed and applied at scale; IF integration of international conventions for mitigation and 
adaptation to climate change and disaster risk reduction are strengthened; (prosperity) IF
capacities for evidence-based SDG policy, strategy and programme formulation, 
implementation, and monitoring are strengthened at both national and sub-national levels; IF
Solutions to promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth benefiting women, youth 
and vulnerable people are developed; IF national capacities to develop and implement 
integrated financing framework for sustainable development agenda are strengthened;
(peace) IF capacities for effective, transparent, and accountable delivery of essential services 
are enhanced; IF institutional capacities and oversight of electoral processes for peaceful and 
inclusive democratic systems are strengthened; IF legal frameworks, policies, strategies, 
mechanisms fostering human rights, non-discrimination, social inclusion and equality are 
enhanced THEN people, including women, youth, people living with disabilities become 
more resilient and are empowered to escape multidimensional poverty.
Sustainable natural resources management and resilience
12. UNDP will respond to national priorities to enhance the management of natural resources 
through a strategy that integrates building the resilience of people and planet, gender 
mainstreaming, the formulation of innovative solutions, and promotion of policy incentives 
for community led, private and public sector partnerships to address climate change effects 
and improve livelihoods. These interventions will cut across UNDP Signature Solutions 1 
(poverty and inequality), 3 (resilience), 4 (environment), 5 (energy) and 6 (gender equality).
13. Underpinned by a deep commitment to sustainability, inclusion and equity, UNDP will 
strengthen capacities of institutions and communities at national and subnational levels to 
develop and implement gender-responsive policies, programmes, strategies and plans that 
reduce degradation of the environment and ecosystems, promote sustainable management of 
natural resources, and re-use and recycle waste. Subnational and national entities will be 
supported through Natural Capital Accounting systems to better manage natural resources 
for improved livelihood options and poverty reduction. 
14. Building on its corporate Climate Promise initiative that enhanced Nationally 
Determined Contributions (NDCs), UNDP along with the United Nations Environment 
Programme (UNEP) Regional Office and partners such as the European Union, will advocate
for more ambitious climate action by supporting the effective domestication and integration 
of the 2030 Agenda, Paris Agreement, the Sendai Framework and other international
frameworks into national and local development plans, and policy measures that build 
resilience of systems and people for accelerated sustainable development. 
22 Ibid15. Most rural people, the majority women and small-scale farmers, depend on agriculture 
for their livelihoods.
23 However, the sector is vulnerable to the impact of climate change and
increasingly frequent extreme weather (droughts, floods, and dry spells ) that lead to reduced 
productivity, food and water insecurity, as well as increased health issues. Building on its 
programme implemented with World Food Programme (WFP) and Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO), UNDP will support strengthening the climate resilience of smallholders
by implementing ‘climate-smart agriculture’ focused on commercialization and semiprocessing of products along with improved access to markets and alternative livelihoods. 
Additional support will improve farmer access to weather indexed insurance schemes and 
climate information services for climate risk management.
16. This country programme will support the formulation of gender-sensitive and responsive
policies and regulatory frameworks to advance access to renewable energy systems and 
energy efficient technologies at national and subnational levels, with a focus on rural areas. 
This includes the design and promotion of incentives to accelerate public and private 
investments in off-grid renewable energy solutions that improve the provision of education, 
health, and other social services in rural areas, urban informal settlements, and other 
disadvantaged areas. 
17. UNDP will support the government to ensure natural ecosystems are healthier through a 
people-centred approach where women, youth, vulnerable and marginalized people
contribute to, and benefit from, the sustainable management and use of natural resources and 
environmental services. This strategy is expected to build the resilience of these groups to 
effectively respond to climate change and disaster risks, as well as other shocks.
Inclusive economic diversification and growth 
18. A three-pronged approach will be applied in line with UNDP Signature Solution 1 
(poverty and inequality), 4 (environment) and 6 (gender equality) to set-up innovative 
solutions that leverage digitalization, strategic innovation involving communities, civil 
society, and the establishment of public-private sector partnerships.
19. First, UNDP will strengthen capacities at national and decentralized levels for the 
collection and analysis of gender-sensitive statistical and qualitative data for evidence-based 
policy formulation and decision-making that promotes inclusive economic growth and 
diversification. In collaboration with cooperating partners such as Sweden, the United 
Nations’ Children Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and 
International Financial Institutions (IFIs), UNDP will provide financial and technical support 
to the Zambia Statistics Agency (ZamStats) to improve its capacity for data collection and 
analysis. This includes strengthened collaborations with academia and local think tanks. 
20. Second, UNDP will focus on testing and scaling-up solutions that foster green job 
creation by complementing European Union interventions on climate and environmental 
investments that promote inclusive green economic growth.24 As a United Nations technical 
lead on youth issues, UNDP will leverage public-private collaboration and partnerships by 
providing business development support services to micro, small and medium enterprises 
(MSMEs) to create decent livelihood opportunities and promote value chain solutions. This 
will include the development of initiatives such as volunteerism, internships, graduate
programmes, and apprenticeships for young people that enhance their employability, in 
particular young women and youth with living with disabilities. UNDP will capitalize on 
existing political will to prioritize youth economic empowerment by developing scalable 
solutions. This includes the promotion of youth entrepreneurship that seizes opportunities 
offered by new administrative economic diplomacy that leverages the African Continental 
Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) opportunities.

implement an integrated financing framework for sustainable development. In so doing, 
UNDP will support initiatives for the better alignment of planning, budgeting and financing 
systems, including the formulation of gender-sensitive policies, strategies and programmes,
and the identification of innovative financing models for mobilization of additional resources 
that promote inclusive economic diversification to reduce poverty and accelerate SDG
implementation. 
Good governance, inclusive and participatory society 
22. Interventions under this area will apply strategies set out in the UNDP Signature 
Solutions 2 (governance) and 6 (gender equality). 
23. UNDP will continue to provide timely technical assistance to democratic processes by
promoting the inclusive participation of women, youth, people in lawful custody, people 
living with disabilities, and other marginalized groups. As a trusted broker in providing past
electoral assistance, UNDP will strengthen democratic processes and systems by building the 
capacities of the judiciary, parliament, and Electoral Commission of Zambia (ECZ). This 
includes building strong support for civic and voter education, peacebuilding, and advocacy 
for more women in leadership positions and political representation by supporting legal 
reforms, policies, strategies, and the design and implementation of women’s empowerment 
interventions.
24. The country programme will contribute to the consolidation of peace by developing or 
sustaining innovative solutions like early warning systems and building on existing 
partnerships with key national actors such as the government, civil society, women and youth
networks, faith-based organizations, media, and traditional leaders to detect risks of violence 
to prevent conflict, and advance peacebuilding and social cohesion prior to the next elections 
slated for 2026. 
25. UNDP will promote innovative digital solutions for the enhanced delivery of public 
services, capitalizing on success stories from Ghana and Rwanda where stakeholders 
leveraged innovation and technology hubs. South-South cooperation will be used to expand
propositionsset out in the UNDP Digital Strategy 2022-2025, and the e-Government Division 
will be assisted in implementing the Electronic Government Act through the formulation of
strategies and other reforms that enhance digital ecosystems for better accountability and 
transparency. This will enable digital solutions to be applied that perform core government 
functions, enhance systems, procedures and service delivery to citizens and marginalized 
groups such as people living with disabilities and refugees. Similarly, in collaboration with 
the United Nations-wide Task Group, the Legal Identity for All Agenda will be implemented 
in Zambia with the roll out of biometric national identities that will have far-reaching,
positive effects, including enhancing the integrity of electoral processes, improving
accountability and transparency in business, and social protection.
26. Building on past successes in developing a strong legal and judicial architecture to 
decrease GBV, including fast-track courts in all ten provinces and the introduction of key 
legislation, UNDP, in close collaboration with cooperating partners such as the European 
Union, will support legislative and policy frameworks to address the social and cultural 
norms that negative practices, foster societal inequality, and negatively affect the 
empowerment of women and girls. 
27. Legal reforms, policy and strategies will promote access to justice, human rights, and 
non-discrimination that affects marginalized and vulnerable groups such as women, youth, 
people living with HIV and key populations. This includes identifying links between duty 
bearers and rights holders to enable the fulfilment of human rights for all in line with regional 
and international treaties and conventions. 
III. Programme and risk management 
28. In the past two years, the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative socioeconomic impact on 
the lives of marginalized and vulnerable people. It will continue to pose a risk to development gains while disrupting the implementation of any recovery programmes. This country 
programme will mainstream digitalization for the formulation and implementation of 
interventions to address challenges related to the continuity of essential public services. 
29. Vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change may lead to extreme weather 
events resulting in humanitarian situations that divert focus and resources from key 
socioeconomic priorities. UNDP will work closely with national authorities and partners to 
promote preparedness and readiness to natural hazards and reduce disaster risks along with 
rapidly roll out the implementation plan related to nationally determined contributions.
30. The Russia-Ukraine war has led to the rapid inflation of prices for fuel and food, putting
pressure on an already stretched fiscal space and threatening food security in the country.27
UNDP will develop and implement a response strategy to deal with the inability to mobilize
adequate resources to implement the country programme by designing contingency scenarios 
where activities are scaled-down. UNDP will support national authorities to identify vital 
sectors that need to be protected from potential budget cuts and submit a substantive revision 
of interventions set out in this country programme. 
31. Identified risks can be mitigated by strengthening the National Local Content Strategy, 
ramping up exports in key sectors (mining and agriculture) while leveraging AfCFTA 
opportunities.28
32. UNDP will apply its Social and Environmental Standards and Accountability 
Mechanism and strictly comply with due diligence policies to manage identified risks and 
mitigate their impacts on the implementation of this country programme. 
33. This country programme document outlines UNDP contributions to national results and 
serves as the primary unit of accountability to the Executive Board for results alignment and 
resources assigned at the programme at country level. Accountabilities of managers at 
country, regional and headquarter levels, with respect to country programmes, is prescribed 
in the organization’s Programme and Operations Policies and Procedures and Internal 
Control Framework.
34. The Programme will be nationally executed. If necessary, national execution may be 
replaced by direct execution for part of the programme to enable response to force majeure. 
Harmonized Approach to Cash Transfers (HACT), will be used in a coordinated fashion with 
other UN agencies to manage financial and reputational risks. Cost definitions and 
classifications for programme and development effectiveness will be charged to the 
concerned projects. UNDP may also use a portfolio approach in responding to development 
challenges. 
IV. Monitoring and evaluation
35. UNDP will monitor the country programme along with national counterparts as part of 
the UNSDCF regular monitoring that is conducted by UNCT Thematic Result Groups. 
Furthermore, UNDP will conduct annual reviews of this programme in conjunction with the 
Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MFNP) in preparation of National Development 
Coordination Committee (NDCC) meetings that oversee the implementation of the 8NDP. 
This includes regular consultations with national and cooperating partners and beneficiaries 
based on informed decision-making processes with inputs from evaluation exercises. The 
assessment of progresses towards achieving agreed outcome and output indicators will be 
made using national statistics. 
36. Recognizing gaps in data availability to track demographic, economic, social and 
environmental trends with varying levels of coverage and disaggregation will be used to 
support programme and SDG monitoring efforts. Financial, institutional, and technical 
support will be provided to ZamStats to increase the demand of data for evidence-based

disseminate, and use data.
29
37. Efforts towards more data-driven and evidence-based approaches to planning, 
monitoring and evaluation will be intensified along with innovative approaches using remote 
monitoring and digital tools such as UN INFO Platform and Quantum+. A balanced selection 
of outcome and project evaluations will chart progress and lessons learned. Data from
ZamStats, Zambia Institute for Policy Analysis and Research (ZIPAR), and government 
departments will be used to support evidence-based monitoring and evaluation to track 
UNSDCF and 8NDP contributions. In addition, data gathered through UNDP sponsoredresearch will be used for planning, monitoring, reporting and evaluation purposes.
38. The programme established a monitoring and evaluation plan to undertake evaluations 
at programme and project levels through a dedicated monitoring budget set at three per cent
of the overall programme. UNDP will use the gender marker framework to plan and monitor 
gender-related investments and results in line with corporate priorities related to gender
specific interventions.
30 UNDP will invest in building communication capacities as part of 
the wider strategy to undertake advocacy on key development issues and associated policy 
responses. An elaborated communication plan and strategy will be launched to improve 
visibility and reach intended audiences through tailored communication products designed 
for local radio, social media, and online platforms. To this end, a dedicated communication 
budget will be included in the programme cost at inception.
