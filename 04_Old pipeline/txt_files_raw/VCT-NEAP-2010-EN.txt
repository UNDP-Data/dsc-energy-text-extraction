appliances, studies of consumption patterns to design appropriate EE measures, 
general awareness of EE in civil society, standard regulations for buildings, ban 
incandescent light bulbs II. Current Situation
2.1 Fuel imports and energy costs  
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) has a population of 100,272 (2006 estimate)1
inhabitants, with approximately 92,000 of those living on the main island, St. Vincent. 
Other islands of importance are Bequia, Union Island and Canouan. Because of its small 
size and a lack of large industrial activities, SVG has a low demand for energy. The 
country is currently almost completely dependent on imported petroleum products like 
gasoline (for transport), diesel (transport and electricity generation), kerosene (cooking) 
and butane/LPG (cooking, water heating, and industry). Only St. Vincent has indigenous 
hydro resources, which are exploited for electricity generation. Figure 1 presents increase 
of fossil fuel imports in the last 7 years.

2.1.1 Total energy consumption 
The total energy consumption (only fossil fuels) went from 64,840 Tonnes of Oil 
Equivalent (TOE) in 2002 up to ~91,000 TOE2
 in 2008. Meanwhile, hydro power 
contributed slightly less than 2,000 TOE in 2008, i.e. the share of renewable energy (not 
counting non-commercial biomass, charcoal and solar thermal energy) was about 2% of 
total energy consumption. On St. Vincent alone, renewable energy in the form of hydro

2.1.2 Fossil fuel imports trends 
1. Spending on imports of fossil fuels has increased considerably since 2002 
due to the rising price for petroleum on the world markets. The price of oil 
 
3
 Gross electricity production from hydro plants is used as the primary energy form, as suggested by the 
IEA Energy Manual of Statistics, 2005, pg.137. has increased from about US$ 32 per barrel at the beginning of 2004 to more 
than US$ 70 in April 2006 with a new record-high of US$ 147 in July 2008 
(see 
Figure 3). 
Figure 3. New York Mercantile Exchange prices for West Texas Intermediate 1996 - 2009
Considerable increase in expenditure for oil derivate imports have taken place in the last 
six years (see Figure 4), where almost 17% of the country’s GDP was destined to fossil 
fuels imports in 2008, see Figure 5. There is the general belief that petroleum prices tend 
to remain above previous levels due to increased shortages on the world market and oil 
findings (reserves) reaching a peak by the end of this decade4.

Nonetheless, they are still comparable to other island states in the region. fuel taxes imposed on energy consumption in other countries), with final consumer or 
retail costs for transport fuel (at petrol stations) standing at EC$ 7.25 per imperial gallon 
for diesel and EC$ 8.00 per imperial gallon for gasoline in March 2005, and EC$ 9.50 per 
imperial gallon for diesel and EC$ 11.50/imperial gallon for gasoline in the second half 
of 20066. In July 2008, gasoline was sold for EC$ 15.33/imperial gallon and diesel at 
EC$ 15.50/imperial gallon at the petrol station, doubling the price of just three years 
earlier. In August 2009 the price was EC$ 10.61 per imperial gallon for gasoline, 
showing an upwards trend (see Figure 6).

2.1.4 Prices for cooking and other purposes 
The price for LPG used in approximately 20,000 households mainly for cooking purposes 
was also increased in early 2006. In September 2009, a 20 lb cylinder cost EC$ 35-407, 
and a 100 lb cylinder EC$ 163-184.8,9 However, with the implementation of the Energy 
Cooperation Agreement (PETROCARIBE) signed by the Government in 2005, these 
price increases were effectively curtailed through the introduction of cheaper LPG 
supplies under the Agreement, a 22 lb cylinder costing EC$29.00 and a 100 lb cylinder 
EC$155.00. Further, kerosene fuel increased up to EC$15.10/imperial gallon in July 2008 
and went down to EC$ 8.77/imperial gallon in September 2009.

 New pricing schemes came into effect on January 25, 2006. Slightly discounted prices apply to the 
wholesale market. 
7
 Prices for LPG vary per Area, where Area I (Kingstown and suburbs) and Area II (windward up to 
Langley Park and leeward coast up to Wallilabou) its EC$ 35 per 20 lb cylinder; Area III (windward coast 
up to Fancy and leeward coast up to Richmond) is EC$ 36 per 20 lb cylinder; and Area IV (Grenadines) is 
EC$ 40 per 20 lb cylinder. 
8
 Price controls by the government for LPG were established in 2005 as consequence of conflicts with the 
only supplier, Texaco.

St. Vincent and the Grenadines Statutory Rules and Orders, 2006 No. 7. Gazetted 31st of March, 2006. 2.1.5 Fuel price regulation 
All fuel prices to end-consumers have a three-month delay10 and therefore do not reflect 
current variations of prices in the import market. Between January 2005 and January 
2006 prices were kept constant (under government control regulations) despite significant 
cost increases for the purchase of fuels, leading to government subsidies of EC$ 6 million 
in total. 
2.1.6 Electricity rates and generation costs 
Electricity tariffs are composed of a unit cost per kWh, a minimum base charge for 
domestic and commercial consumers, a demand charge for commercial and industrial 
customers, and a fuel surcharge per kWh, which varies monthly depending on fuel costs 
(in April 2006, the fuel surcharge was EC$ 0.372/kWh), see Table 2 for further details. In 
addition, a 15% Value-Added Tax (VAT) is levied on kWh consumption of over 200 
units for domestic consumers11, and on the total consumption for commercial and 
industrial consumers.

Table 2. Electricity rates in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines effective since December 198912
As a consequence of oil price hikes, electricity tariffs increased considerably in recent 
years (see Figure 7). In 2007 households paid on average EC$0.89/kWh including fuel 
surcharge, in 2008 this increased to nearly EC$ 1.05/kWh, i.e. the average annual 
household bill for electricity increased to about EC$ 1700. Due to lower fuel prices, 
average consumer costs for electricity have dropped to EC$ 0.85/kWh in mid 2009. For 
every US$ 10 per barrel of petroleum, the fuel surcharge varies by about US$ 0.02/kWh. 
 
10 Monthly adjustment of prices on the basis of previous three-month average. 
11 Monthly average electricity consumption in the domestic sector was ~150 kWh/month in 2008.

Figure 7. Average cost of electricity for all consumers in accordance to generated revenue from fixed 
tariffs13 and fuel surcharge (Source: VINLEC, 2009) 
The raise in tariff is clearly due to the fuel surcharge, which augmented from a yearly 
average of EC$0.09/kWh in 1998, to EC$0.52/kWh in 2008, an increase of more than 
570% in 10 years. Figure 8 shows how the fuel surcharge is on its way to reach the tariff 
rates set. In 1998, the fuel surcharge was 15% of the full tariff paid by consumers. In 
2008 it was 50%.

13 Includes average cost of kWh to different types of customers, minimum and demand charge, see Table 1. VINLEC's revenue per unit sold is in line with other small island states in the Eastern 
Caribbean, like Grenada, St. Lucia and Dominica, which all face extremely high 
electricity prices due to high priced oil imports and inefficient generation and (in some 
cases) distribution systems. It is clear that those energy prices affect negatively economic 
activities, mainly those closely related to energy-intensive consumption, such as food 
processing, gastronomy and tourism sectors. In this environment, most energy intensive 
industries will not be competitive against lower priced countries in the region (in 
particular Trinidad), thus creating a significant obstacle for development in SVG's 
manufacturing sector. VINLEC has therefore undertaken a Cost-of-Services study that 
was concluded in 2007. The study looked into its cost structure and came up with 
recommendations for a tariff revision that minimises cross-subsidies. The study also 
examined the demand charge levied on both industrial and commercial customers as well 
as a review of the base year used to compute the fuel surcharge. 
While many of the inputs associated with electricity costs have remained stable, the fuel 
costs have tended upwards, resulting in an overall increase in electricity costs over the 
past years (Figure 9).

Figure 9. Cost of electricity generation by type of expenditure 1998-2007 (Source: VINLEC, 2008) 
It is clear that increase in generation costs is mainly due to the increase in fuel and also a 
slight increase in diesel generators’ operation and maintenance. 
2.2 Electricity sectors
2.2.1 Installed capacity 
In 2009, SVG's state-owned utility VINLEC had almost 49 MW (11.5% of the installed 
capacity is hydro) installed capacity, of which 40.5 MW are operated on the main island 
of St. Vincent alone with two diesel generating facilities, Cane Hall (26.2 MW) and 
recently commissioned Lowman’s Bay (8.7 MW), and three hydro power stations 
dministrative & Selling(Cumberland 3.7 MW, Richmond 1.1 MW, and South Rivers 0.9 MW), with the 
remaining diesel fuelled units distributed among Bequia (2.9 MW), Union Island (1.3 
MW), Canouan (3.1 MW) and Mayreau (180 kW); see Figure 10.

The other Grenadines islands are supplied by privately owned electricity systems on the 
basis of diesel plants. Bequia, Union Island, Canouan and Mayreau are also completely 
reliant on diesel power. According to VINLEC’s 2007 report, St. Vincent has some 5.6 
MW (constant in the last 10 years) of available hydro power, depicted in Figure 11, and 
diesel power plants (evolved from 20.8 MW in 1998 up to 35 MW in 2007, an almost 
70% increase in diesel power plants capacity).

Figure 12. Percentages of installed capacity of diesel and hydro 
Since hydro power is not available at full scale year-round and some diesel plants work 
only as back-up systems, the firm capacity is far lower, and reached only approximately 
40 MW in 2009. For St. Vincent alone, the firm capacity was 32 MW, while peak 
demand was 20 MW in 2008, thus leaving sufficient reserve margin during most of the 
year. 
Most of VINLEC's diesel generators are old, inefficient, and in need of replacement by 
newer engines or other means of electricity generation. This represents an opportunity to 
move towards new sources of energy. The specific energy output of 17 kilowatt-hours per 
imperial gallon in 2004 from all diesel-powered generators was below comparable data in 
neighbouring countries. It has increased to slightly over 18 kilowatt-hours per imperial 
gallon in 2009 with the inauguration of the new generator set at Lowmans Bay.14
A new diesel plant of 9 MW at Lowmans Bay began operation at the end of 2006. In 
place of this more efficient plant, outdated generator sets totalling about 6 MW will be 
decommissioned. The new plant is supplied with diesel under the Petrocaribe Agreement. 
The Government is also looking to future electricity generation needs and actively 
pursuing plans for the introduction of an additional 8-10 MW at Lowmans Bay. Works 
have already started for deployment of two new generators that will operate on Heavy 
Fuel Oil (HFO), and transformation of the existing diesel-operating units to HFO. New 
generating units were also installed at the Canouan and Bequia plants in 2007.

VINLEC is the largest sole consumer of imported petroleum products, using 33.83% of 
total oil imports in 2008. That same year, 49% of total diesel imports were used to 
generate electricity. 
Specific fuel costs ranged EC$ 0.20/kWh in 2004, roughly EC$ 0.37/kWh in 2005 and 
EC$ 0.32/kWh in 2007. These numbers give an idea of the potential savings if current 
fossil fuels were replaced with renewable energy sources. Current CO2 emissions from 
the electricity sector are in the range of 77,400 tons per year.15
2.2.3 Electricity generation and sales 
SVG’s residential and commercial sectors, including the government, are the largest 
consumers of electricity (see Figure 14 and Figure 15). On the other hand, there are few 
industrial activities on the island, and consumption for street lighting is minimal. Total 
consumption went from 74.6 GWh in 1998, to 122.9 GWh in 2008—a 70% increase in 
10 years. 
 
15The combustion of 1 litre of diesel leads to the emission of about 2.7 kg of CO2. Figure 14. Electricity consumption in St. Vincent and the Grenadines by sector in 2008 (Source: 
VINLEC, 2009) 
Figure 15. Evolution of energy consumption in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines per sector from 
1998-2008 (Source: VINLEC, 2009) 
2.2.4 Losses 
In 2007, line losses and unmeasured consumption accounted for 8.7% of the total 
consumption, showing a downward trend since 1998 (see Figure 16). This percentage is 
considered low when compared to international standards. Nevertheless, a 1% drop in electricity losses would increase delivered generation by 1.2 GWh.

2.2.5 Electricity peak demand 
Peak demand in St. Vincent alone has risen from less than 14 MW in 1998, to 20 MW in 
2008 – a 40% increase in 10 years. Peak demand in the Grenadine islands (with the 
exception of Mayreau) has shown similar increases. Canouan’s peak demand has 
increased by about 60% (see Figure 17). 
Figure 17. Electricity peak demand evolution (1998-2008) in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 
(Source: VINLEC, 2009) Typical day load curves for St. Vincent show that peak demand occurs from 10:00 am to 
4:00 pm. A smaller peak occurs from 7:00 pm to 8:00 pm on weekdays, whilst weekend 
peak demand takes place from 6:00 pm to 10:00 pm (see Figure 18). These patterns 
reveal the hours where efficiency measures are mostly needed.

2.3 Transport sector
While energy demand from all sectors increased due to economic growth and rising 
incomes, the transportation sector fuels the fastest-growing demand. With more than 
25,382 vehicles16 registered in SVG in July 2009 (see Figure 19 for number of imported 
vehicles per year), private and public transport is the largest energy consuming sector, 
with 9.7 million imperial gallons of diesel and 6.4 million imperial gallons of gasoline 
spent in 200817, a steady increase is portrayed mainly for diesel in Figure 20). Most of the 
vehicles are privately owned sedans, but there is also a significant quantity of mini-vans 
operated by privately owned public transport business. 
As of 15th December 2009, there were approximately 1095 vessels operating in the 
waters of St. Vincent and the Grenadines/utilizing fuel from St. Vincent and the 
Grenadines. Of these: 50 inclusive of nine (9) local Roro passenger ships, 12 cargo 
ships18 are registered with the Maritime Administration; 745 are fishing vessels, of which 
738 are propelled by gasoline outboard engines and seven (7) are propelled by diesel 
engines; there is an estimated 200 private vessels of which 15 have diesel engines; and, 
there is an estimated 100 small commercial yachts.
 
16 Data provided by the Motor Vehicle Registration Statistics, Inland Revenue Department. This may not 
represent the real size of SVG’s fleet, since many of the registered vehicles may not be actually “on the 
road”, but should be used as an estimate of the fleet size. 
17 These values represent all diesel and gasoline that was not used for electricity generation. Road and sea 
transport and other minor fuel consuming activities are taken into account. 
18 These cargo ships trade within the Caribbean area. They may fuel outside of St. Vincent and the

The average age of the vehicle fleet is rather high, hence contributing to higher fuel 
consumption, combined with the lack of emissions monitoring and regular engine 
maintenance requirements, a low performing public transport system, mediocre road 
conditions, and poor traffic management. 
Between 1998 and 2008, about 1400 cars are imported every year on average, with a high 
share of second-hand vehicles. There is also a tendency to import large-size vehicles with 
higher fuel consumption (low mileage per gallon). Small-size light-weight cars with 
efficient low-consuming engines and motor-cycles are not very common. 2.4 Renewable energy sources
SVG has substantial renewable energy sources to provide for heat (solar thermal, 
biomass), electricity (wind, geothermal, hydro, and solar) and possibly fuel (biomass). 
While these resources offer the potential to supply a large share of future energy needs, 
only hydro (see 2.2.1 above) and solar (hot water heating systems) energy are being 
tapped. 
Hydro power - is only used on the island of St. Vincent and has a total installed capacity 
of 5.6 MW, of which only about 5.2 MW are available. It is currently providing around 
20% of VINLEC's gross electricity production. Due to varying precipitation over the 
year, the constantly available capacity (firm capacity) is far lower than the rated capacity 
and amounts to about 2 MW at present. The hydro power facilities at South Rivers (3 
turbines with a total rated capacity of 0.9 MW) and Richmond (2 turbines with a total of 
1.1 MW rated capacity) were built in the late 1950's and early 1960's respectively. The 
plant at Cumberland was built between 1987 and 1988 (5 turbines with a total of 3.7 
MW). All of the installations are of the run-of-river type. 
According to preliminary studies prepared with support from the German Agency for 
Technical Cooperation (GTZ) in the context of the Caribbean Renewable Energy 
Development Programme (CREDP), further potential exists for additional hydro power 
exploitation through rehabilitation and expansion of existing plants and development of 
new sites. In 2009, a comprehensive feasibility study was carried out for the 
rehabilitation of the Richmond and South Rivers plants, and the development of a second 
plant along the Colonaire River, downstream of the existing South Rivers plant. The 
rehabilitation and the expansion projects were both found to be technically and 
economically feasible. Tendering processes for these projects should commence in 2010. 
The conservatively estimated, unused hydro power potential is in the range of 5 to 10 
MW from the rivers of Wallibou and Buccament. There are plans to install river flow 
gauging equipment at the Wallibou River in 2010 in order to record the long-term flow 
characteristics of the river. 
The use of solar water heaters is not widespread. The systems are imported from 
Barbados and are commonly found in large residential buildings. Their deployment 
should be expanded throughout all sectors so that the island’s entire hot water demand is 
supplied exclusively through solar energy. 
There is considerable wind energy potential mainly on the eastern side of St. Vincent and 
Bequia, and on all of the smaller islands. Wind power has been traditionally utilized to 
grind grains. 
With assistance from CREDP/GTZ, VINLEC has identified potential wind sites for small 
wind parks. Since September 2005, VINLEC has been collecting data on wind speeds at a 
site in Brighton. The measured annual average wind speed at 10 metres is of 7.8 m/s. 
Higher wind speeds are reached at 40 to 50 metres, which is the average hub height of a standard wind turbine suitable for St. Vincent. Another wind measurement tower has 
been operating at Ribishi Point, close to the Brighton landfill site, since March 2007. 
There, wind speeds and directions are being recorded at 10 metres and 30 metres. At 30 
metres, the annual average wind speed is in excess of 8.9 m/s. A third wind measurement 
tower at Belle Isle has been recording wind speed data at 10 metres since 2007. However, 
the wind regime at this location has been determined not to be favourable for wind park 
development. Currently, VINLEC is considering the options of partnering with a private 
investor to build a wind park at Ribishi Point or building the facility on its own. A 
decision should be made in 2010. 
Biomass resources are mainly exploited in a non-sustainable manner through the use of 
charcoal. There are no known biogas plants or other applied technologies that make use 
of biomass resources in a modern way. The potential to extract oil from coconuts or other 
seeds (like Jatropha curcas – also known as “Barbados nut” in the region) and use this oil 
either in its pure form, or transform it into biodiesel, has so far not been examined. In 
2009 GFA Envest GmbH in collaboration with Caribbean Bio-Energy Technology Ltd. 
(CBET) concluded a feasibility study that examined the use of available agriculture and 
municipal biomass resources for the production of electricity using biogas plants. The 
study concluded, among other things, that while considerable biomass residues are 
currently available in SVG, their quality is not sufficient for imminent use in biogas 
plants. The study further examined the possibility to run a biogas plant based on a 
mixture of input substrates consisting mainly of energy crops that can be produced on 
available idle agricultural land in SVG and by a shift in markets of actual cultivated land. 
The results of the study were presented to the National Energy Committee, the Ministry 
of Agriculture and other energy stakeholders. A source of development funding for 
implementation of an initial phase of a recommended biogas plant is needed. 
Geothermal power offers the potential to supply all of the base load electricity demand on 
mainland St. Vincent and, through interconnections, to the Grenadine islands and to other 
neighbouring islands. Although the Government has undertaken a number of preliminary 
investigations of geothermal resources in St. Vincent over the last 15 years, the actual 
potential is yet to be proven by drilling. The Government is currently considering further 
proposals that will lead to suitable development of the geothermal resources in St. 
Vincent. The Government signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in 2008 with 
a potential private developer to facilitate negotiation of a geothermal exploration and 
exploitation agreement (GEA). By January 2010, the Government completed its review 
of a proposed GEA and signed the agreement that grants the developer the exclusive right 
to investigate and develop the resources within a specified geothermal area and to operate 
the project. III. Summary of Reference Case Business‐as‐ Usual
(BaU)
  
In a business-as-usual scenario where electricity consumption is left unchecked (i.e., 
without any kind of Government action or intervention), it is estimated that massive 
investments in the order of EC$ 70-100 million would be needed by 201519 to 
commission new power generation facilities, rehabilitate or replace old power stations 
and enhance the distribution system. Energy consumption will also increase in all other 
sectors at a rate equal or greater than GDP growth as recently experienced, and it will 
rely increasingly on the import of fossil fuels (mainly petroleum derivates). Such 
development will create a heavy burden on the national budget as well as on the private, 
public and commercial sectors for purchasing any kind of energy. 
According to VINLEC, if the Government does not take action to diversify energy 
sources, seek for long-term energy security and promote energy efficiency, the energy 
sector will develop as follows20: 
 Peak electricity demand will be 27 MW on the island of St. Vincent by 2015 
and 31 MW by 2020, together with reserve power requiring an installed 
capacity of 48 MW and 55 MW respectively. 
 Additional capacity will be based on diesel-powered generators and/or heavy 
fuel oil (HFO). 
 Gross Electricity generation will rise to 158 GWh by 2015 and 184 GWh by 
2020 (VINLEC, 2009), leading to an additional requirement of 1 million 
imperial gallons of diesel imports by 2015 and more than 3 million imperial 
gallons by 2020 (assuming that all new generation comes from diesel gensets). 
Consequently, CO2 emissions will also augment. 
 For the smaller islands of SVG it is also projected that electricity consumption 
and load will increase over the next decade at a rate of 3% to 4% per year. 
 The number of vehicles21 is projected to increase at a 2% rate per year (i.e. 
~10,000 more cars will be imported by 2015). Meanwhile, fuel consumption 
in the transport sector will continue increasing as well, reaching 13 million 
imperial gallons of diesel and 8.3 million imperial gallons of gasoline by 
2015, based on observed behaviour in the last years and expected increase in 
the transport fleet. 
 
19 Based on current investments made by VINLEC and projected growth of the power sector 
20 As it relates to projected development in the electricity sector only. 
21 There is a considerable discrepancy between values reported by the Licensing Department and Statistics 
Office. According to VINLEC’s projections, the following scenarios reflect the development of 
gross electricity generation and expected peak demand behaviour in coming years, see 
Figure 21 and Figure 22.

Figure 22. Electricity Gross Generation VINLEC’s Scenario in SVG 
In the last ten years (1998-2007) electricity demand has grown yearly by an average of 
5.4% in the domestic sector, 7.7% in the commercial sector, 1.1% in the industrial sector 
and 4% in street lighting. Meanwhile, peak demand growth has been 5% per year. For this reason it is imperative to focus on actions in the commercial and domestic sectors. 
Complementary activities should be undertaken in the industry sector and with regard to 
the street lighting infrastructure. IV. Energy Action Plan
The purpose of this section is to develop possible scenarios for SVG’s energy future from 
2009 until 2030. It contains short (1-5 years), medium (5-10 years), and long (10-20 
years) term actions designed to enhance the implementation of the policies and goals of 
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines’ National Energy Policy (NEP). These actions foster to 
energy conservation, energy efficiency, and diversification of energy source and energy 
use sectors. 
4.1 Planning and management
GOAL: Consolidate well coordinated planning and management programmes to 
achieve sustainable supply and use of energy by 2015 
4.1.1 Institutional requirements 
The Prime Minister took over the energy portfolio in 2006. Subsequently, he established 
a National Energy Committee in 2006 and an Energy Unit in 2008 for the development 
and implementation of the National Energy Policy, which was adopted by Cabinet in 
February 2009. The Prime Minister, in his function as Minister of Finance, is also 
responsible for the control of fuel prices. The Government has therefore established 
structures that allow for concentrated efforts needed to reshape the energy sector and 
formulate decisions in an effective and linear approach. It will now be necessary to 
strengthen staff capability to deal with all types of energy policy matters as well as 
promotional and information activities. 
Action 1: The Cabinet will decide which agencies of Government (e.g., 
Ministry of Energy, other ministries, state institutions or companies, 
VINLEC, Bureau of Standards, etc.) are responsible for energy issues. The 
Cabinet will base its decision on the advice of the National Energy 
Committee composed of different ministries and national stakeholders, and 
presided by the Office of the Prime Minister. The Government will 
undertake efforts to strengthen the knowledge of its staff on all energyrelated issues. 
Time-scale: Short-term 
4.1.2 Energy database and publication of annual energy statistics 
In order to develop any long-term energy strategy, and for electricity supply planning 
purposes, it is essential to have reliable knowledge of the status and history of energy 
supply and consumption in different sectors, and data related to those sectors such as the 
number and type of vehicles, the use of electric water heaters, etc. Such statistical data 
are currently not available, or are spread among different market participants. A full-scale 
energy balance is currently not available, while other energy-related figures are either 
unregistered or out-of-date. Action 2: The Office of Statistics will establish procedures for the 
retrieval of up-to-date, relevant and meaningful information on energy 
from several market participants. The information shall be utilized to 
produce statistical data and materials on energy supply and consumption 
which the Office of Statistics will compile annually in an energy balance. 
The annual energy balance shall be made available to the public through 
different media, including the Internet, and shall provide reliable 
information on the state of energy supply and consumption for each sector 
of the economy. These activities shall assist the Government in ensuring, 
and following up with, the compliance of energy targets.
Time-scale: Short-term
4.1.3 Capacity building, education and awareness raising 
Capacity building, institutional strengthening and awareness raising are fundamental 
aspects of any sustainable energy strategy. 
Action 3: The Ministry of Education will propose a strategy for the 
implementation of energy-related capacity building activities at all levels of 
education, from primary schools to colleges and universities. It will provide 
financial support for advanced professional training, particularly in the 
field of renewable energy applications and general awareness raising, and 
will seek the participation and financing of national stakeholders and 
international donors. 
Time-scale: Short-term 
4.1.4 Pilot and demonstration projects 
Pilot and demonstration projects are a valuable and convincing tool to showcase how 
energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies can be implemented, and show 
positive results with regard to economic and ecological effects. The Government is 
therefore determined to select and support such projects that have a high potential to raise 
awareness and act as a model for subsequent actions by the private or public sector. 
Action 4: The Ministry of Energy, in cooperation with the Finance 
Department, will examine ways to set up a fund in support of small-scale 
pilot and demonstration projects to showcase new ways to enhance energy 
efficiency. 
Time-scale: Short-term 
Action 5: The Ministry of Energy and the International Airport 
Development Company (IADC) will ensure that the new International 
Airport at Argyle is built in the most energy efficient manner possible, by erecting well-insulated buildings and using natural ventilation and properly 
designed day-lighting. The Government will also consider the use of roofintegrated solar electricity and solar thermal systems in combination with 
absorption cooling and energy efficient artificial lighting, acting as a showcase for the nation and the region. 
Time-scale: Short-term 
4.1.5 Interconnection 
Based on a preliminary study developed by VINLEC in early 2009, interconnection with 
the Grenadines islands is not a cost-effective alternative. Nonetheless, there is an interest 
to determine when interconnection between islands of the country would become a 
feasible alternative. Moreover, the materialization of geothermal development can bring 
SVG the opportunity to export electricity where interconnectivity with other island states 
is a realistic option. 
Action 6: The Ministry of Energy, in collaboration with VINLEC, will 
investigate opportunities for electrical interconnection between and among 
different islands of the country, and with neighbouring states, and take 
notice of results from studies being developed by international 
organisations. 
Time-scale: Long-term
4.1.6 Environmental impact assessment 
Renewable energy and conventional energy projects must be set up without disturbing 
and harming the environment (air pollution, water pollution, loss of biodiversity among 
others). For example, an environmental impact assessment should provide evidence that 
no major negative influence on the local communities and species will occur from 
erecting and operating wind farms of more than three turbines. The impact of new 
hydropower plants on the environment can also be minimized by using adequate 
technologies and design solutions. Energy projects should focus first on those locations 
with the least intrinsic human and wildlife habitat values. 
Action 7: The Ministry of Environment will make itself familiar with 
the requirements and standards of environmental impact assessments for 
geothermal, solar, wind farms, hydropower facilities, and any new energy 
project, and build sufficient capacity in this area. In the shortest time 
possible, it will establish guidelines for such studies and seek assistance 
from international experts if necessary. Environmental impacts caused by 
renewable energy plants will be compared to impacts of fossil-fuel based 
plants. 
Time-scale: Short-term 4.1.7 International cooperation and financing 
The transformation and modernization of the energy sector will require financial means 
that exceed the national budget of SVG as well as the burden that can be carried by 
VINLEC. It will therefore be necessary to seek for international financing and funding 
sources for investments, pilot actions, institutional and capacity building as well as 
information activities. It will be easier to attract private investors if additional financing 
sources with preferential conditions can be made available. 
Such sources can be the European Development Fund (EDF), the Caribbean 
Development Bank (CDB), the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the World 
Bank, the German Development Bank KfW and other donors and financing institutions. 
Credits for the avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions could possibly be obtained and 
sold through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), if major renewable energy or 
energy efficiency projects in the region are bundled. 
Action 8: The Ministry of Energy will get in contact with international 
donor and financing institutions in order to access additional funding 
sources for energy efficiency and renewable energy measures and 
investments. It will also draft applications for such purpose and assist the 
private sector in accessing favourable financing conditions. Grant funding 
from the European Development Fund within the Special Framework of 
Assistance (SFA), which has already been approved, will be used mainly to 
further implement the National Energy Policy and put different activities 
into effect. 
Time-scale: Short-term 
4.1.8 Financial incentives 
Energy efficient products still have in many cases higher costs than similar products with 
low efficiency. Renewable energy technologies generally show relatively high up-front 
investment costs, but require far lower operation and maintenance costs than 
conventional technologies. Therefore, to overcome the obstacle of high initial costs and 
stimulate the market for innovative energy technologies it is recommended to provide 
financial (grants or soft-loans) or fiscal (tax credits, reduction or exemption from duty 
taxes and consumption taxes etc.) incentives. Currently incandescent light bulbs are taxed 
with 100% excise tax and 15% Value Added Tax (VAT), while compact fluorescent 
lamps (CFLs) are fully exempted from excise tax and VAT. 
Action 9: The Ministry of Finance will select a list of items that will be 
completely or partially exempted from import or consumption taxes, while 
higher taxes may be imposed on energy inefficient devices. Such list will 
include systems and components which contribute directly to improved 
energy efficiency or the use of renewable energy sources. It will also 
consider a scheme of tax credits to the benefit of all legitimate persons and companies that make investments in energy efficiency measures or for the 
use of renewable energy sources. The Ministry of Finance will also 
reconsider the current exemption from Value Added Tax (VAT) for 
electricity, gasoline, kerosene, diesel and LPG. 
Time-scale: Short-term
4.1.9 Monitoring and evaluation 
In order to verify if the overall targets will be achieved and appropriate actions are being 
taken, a continuous monitoring and evaluation process will be needed. This provides the 
Government with the information necessary to adopt its policy over time and take up 
additional adjustment measures if required. It will further secure that Parliament and the 
general public are informed about the effects and results of actions implemented within 
the National Energy Policy. 
Action 10: The Ministry of Energy, with support from other relevant 
Ministries, public institutions and VINLEC, will report biannually on the 
status and outcomes resulting from the implementation of the actions listed 
above. Further, the Ministry of Energy will revise the energy action plan 
accordingly if required, to meet the overall energy targets or to adapt to 
new political conditions. The biannual status report shall be made available 
to the public through different media, including the Internet. 
Time-scale: Short-term (long-term continuance) 
4.2 Power sector
GOAL: Reduce projected increase in peak demand by 5% by 2015 and 10% by 
2020, and strive to reduce power losses down to a total of 7% by 2015 and 5% by 
2020. 
4.2.1 Long-term planning for the electricity sector 
The effective use of financial capital and the security of electricity supply in the longer 
term is very much dependent on a prospective planning, taking into account forecasts on 
energy demand, price development and availability of primary resources. It is therefore 
necessary to design long-term planning prospects dealing with questions such as grid 
enhancement and extension, power capacity development, electricity consumption, etc. 
Action 11: Every two years, VINLEC will design and review a 10-year 
planning prospect for the electricity sector, and discuss the results with the 
Government. 
Time-scale: Short-term (long-term continuance) 4.2.2 Tariff structures 
The high electricity prices for industrial and commercial customers in combination with 
inequities in the formula for computation of the Demand Charge have put a heavy burden 
on many such consumers and given indication that prices do not fully reflect costs. 
Action 12: VINLEC has recently conducted a Cost of Service Study that 
analyses, among other things, the cost and tariff structures of the utility. 
Based on this study, VINLEC will be requested to derive a more equitable 
formula for imposing the demand charge, in particular for the commercial 
sector. VINLEC will be requested to look at ways on how tariff structures 
could better reflect real costs.
Time-scale: Short-term
4.2.3 Demand side management 
There is high potential for energy conservation and efficiency in the manufacturing 
industry as well as in the commercial and domestic sector. To tap this potential, energy 
audits and technical advice to different types of customers regarding the potential to 
improve their energy consumption patterns is needed. Further, new financing 
mechanisms that allow for carrying the initial investment costs are needed. 
Action 13: The Ministry of Energy, with support from VINLEC, will 
initiate a programme for improved demand side management by offering 
low- or no-cost services for energy audits to major electricity consumers. 
VINLEC will also offer, whenever this is feasible, low-interest loans for 
the purchase of energy efficient devices, or pre-payment schemes for the 
purchase of such goods (e.g., solar water heaters and CFLs), where credits 
are repaid through the cost savings on the electricity bill. Mainly for 
domestic and commercial customers, the Ministry of Energy will consider 
to set up an information and advisory centre, and produce adequate 
publications to inform about ways for smart and cost-saving energy use. 
Time-scale: Medium-term
4.3 Renewable energy
GOAL: Deliver 30% of projected total electricity output from Renewable Energy 
Sources (RES) by 2015 and 60% by 2020 
Preliminary findings show that several sources of renewable energy can be exploited at 
costs that are competitive with conventional power sources as long as no major 
investments have to be made for infrastructural improvements such as road construction 
or grid extension and reinforcement (e.g., generation costs for wind energy could be 
lower than EC$ 0.20/kWh, well below the current fuel acquisition cost of about EC$ 
0.28/kWh). For rehabilitation of the older hydro power plants, estimations show that generation costs would also be in a similar range. Despite their high up-front costs, both 
hydro and wind power have the advantage that operational costs are low; therefore their 
price stability is high. Wind turbines usually have a life span of at least 20 years if 
properly monitored and maintained. Hydropower plants can run for more than 40 years, if 
overhauled regularly. 
Several actions must take place for a rapid and successful deployment of renewable 
energy technologies. To expand the use of renewable energy sources it is critical to 
ascertain where key project opportunities exist. Within the framework of the Caribbean 
Renewable Energy Development Programme (CREDP), executed with support of 
GTZ/Germany, there is an ongoing process of measuring and assessing potentials for the 
exploitation of wind and hydro power resources in collaboration with VINLEC. 
Furthermore, there is a need to take a closer look into the potential for biomass and 
geothermal energy. Given the large increase of global production capacity for solar cells 
and modules, photovoltaic systems have seen a sharp decline in price in the first half of 
2009, which are 30% lower than at the end of 2008. In particular situations, such as offgrid supply, and with increasing oil prices, solar electricity can already compete with 
fossil fuel power generation. Besides the main island of St. Vincent, assessments should 
also cover the smaller inhabited islands of the Grenadines. 
4.3.1 Renewable Energy Resource potentials 
4.3.1.1 Geothermal 
The accurate assessment of geothermal energy potential for electricity generation 
depends on explorations involving the drilling of boreholes, which is an expensive 
process that can only be carried out either with international financial support, or by the 
private sector interested in exploiting these resources. In May 2008, the Government 
signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) effectively granting exclusive rights to a 
private company, for a period of 12 months, to negotiate an agreement with the 
Government for the development of geothermal energy resources within an initial 
Geothermal Resource Area defined in the MoU. The expiration date of the MoU was 
extended to December 2009 to facilitate conclusion of the negotiations. The Government, 
after several years of negotiation, made an exclusive agreement with a private entity to 
develop, explore and exploit geothermal resources. 
Action 14: The Ministry of Energy and the Government shall ensure 
sustainable development of exclusive geothermal exploration and 
exploitation in the Soufriere Resource Area on mainland St. Vincent, in 
accordance to agreement made. If the initial explorations yield positive 
results, the exploitation of such geothermal resources shall be in a fashion 
that benefits the nation. The Ministry of Energy will ensure that such 
exclusive agreement entered into with the private developer is followed 
accordingly and that in the event that the developer fails to comply with its duties and obligations in a timely manner and to the extent agreed, the 
Government can invoke explicit termination clauses at various stages of the 
development process to terminate agreement. 
Time-scale: Short-term 
4.3.1.2 Hydro power 
VINLEC commissioned a comprehensive feasibility study in 2009 with funding from 
CRETAF to validate the results of previous studies conducted with assistance from 
CREDP/GTZ that had concluded potential for raising the capacity and gaining additional 
output of 27% and 13% respectively above the current average annual electricity 
production at the Richmond and South Rivers hydro plants. The new study examined the 
civil and electromechanical structures at the plants, the topography of the surrounding 
rivers and plant sites and the environmental and social impact to renew and maximize the 
output of the plants. 
The results showed that most of the civil and electromechanical equipment can be 
replaced at a cost of 8-8.5 M USD to gain increased energy output of 13% and 10% 
above the current average annual electricity production of the Richmond and South 
Rivers plants respectively. The potential of the sites can yield greater gains of 24% and 
46% respectively but the environmental and social impact assessments indicate that this 
additional yield will require use of residual water flows necessary to sustain aquatic life 
and social activities. 
The scope was later expanded to include the feasibility of developing a second stage 
hydropower plant downstream of the existing South Rivers hydropower station. The 
proposed capacity is 1.19 MW with an annual energy output of 4,870 MWh. This would 
increase the energy output from South Rivers to 8,930 MWh which is a 120% increase 
above the current average annual electricity production of the South Rivers Power 
Station. The new study concluded that such rehabilitation works would be economically 
and financially viable, even by basing the calculation on a conservative future oil price of 
US$ 60 per barrel. 
The CRETAF funding also provided for the preparation of Tender Designs and Tender 
Documents which should be of sufficient detail to use in the tendering process to secure 
Contractors from the international market to supply material, equipment and labor to 
upgrade and build these power stations. 
The previous feasibility studies on hydro energy potential have also pointed to the need 
for long-term flow measurements by installing or re-installing river gauging stations at 
the existing hydro power stations as well as at potential new hydro power sites. 
Furthermore, it is assumed that untapped rivers at Fancy, as well as larger rivers like 
Wallibou, Buccament and Rabacca, offer additional hydro power resources of 
significance. 
Even if no immediate development of further new sites is considered, assessing the potential of other hydro power locations is urgently required in the interest of securing a 
future sustainable energy mix in SVG. Considering that reliable hydrological data should 
be based on data collection over 10- to 20-year periods, a comprehensive river gauging 
programme should be started without further delay as an investment into the future. 
A hydrometeorologic network has been erected in the framework of the National Water 
Resource Management Study Programme (NWRMSP) supported by the European 
Development Fund (EDF). The NWRM study is assessing the water resources of all the 
islands used as potable water and for irrigation and hydro power purposes, in 
collaboration with the Central Water and Sewerage Authority (CWSA). VINLEC is 
contributing to the study, which was started in fall 2006 and will end in 2010. 
Future of hydropower production depends mainly on the long-term availability of 
sufficient water resources. River flows are threatened by deforestation, variation of 
annual precipitations caused by climate change and competing uses, like fresh water 
supply and irrigation. 
Canouan, Union, Bequia and other Grenadine islands do not have substantial rivers, and 
their annual rainfall ranges from 900 to 1,600 millimetres. Therefore, there are no 
suitable locations for hydro power production. 
Action 15: VINLEC, in collaboration with the Government and initially 
assisted through the Caribbean Renewable Energy Development 
Programme (CREDP), will select appropriate river sites for possible future 
hydro power plants and start a long-term gauging programme in order to 
get reliable hydrological data that cover various seasons and give sufficient 
evidence on the medium availability of water for run-of-river power 
stations. Such undertaking will be done in collaboration with, and on the 
basis of, the NWRMSP. A Hydrometeorologic Unit will be set up for all 
long term water resource measurements in St. Vincent and the Grenadines 
in order to ensure the future provision of hydrometric data. Formerly 
existing measuring stations will be reinstated if possible. The Government, 
VINLEC and CWSA will ensure the sustainability of the 
Hydrometeorologic Unit established under the CWSA; in such way ensure 
an integral management of water resources exploitable for hydro power 
generation. Moreover, in the shortest time possible the Government 
together with the NWRMSP shall design a plan for the reforestation of land 
in hydrological sensible areas and establish guidelines for a long-term 
sustainable forest management, including the creation of preserved areas 
and buffer zones in which unregulated logging will not be allowed. 
Time-scale: Short to long-term 
Action 16: The Government will request to VINLEC to provide the 
financial means for the rehabilitation of the hydro power plants at South 
River and Richmond, and for the installation of new small hydro power 
plants. The Ministry of Energy and the Finance Department will assist in finding adequate financing sources and secure bank guarantees. 
Time-scale: Short to medium-term 
4.3.1.3 Wind energy 
Preliminary findings show that there is a technical potential in the range of several MW 
coming from wind energy on St. Vincent and some of the smaller islands. Previous wind 
measurements in St. Vincent have indicated mean wind speeds of 7-8 m/s on eastward 
facing ridges. Bequia and Union Island both have good potential sites, with estimated 
annual mean wind speeds of 7-8 m/s on eastward facing ridges. The island of Canouan 
has an excellent wind regime with annual averages estimated to be above 8 m/s. Mayreau 
has a very similar wind regime, and a small wind-diesel hybrid system could provide the 
island with relatively cheap power. 
A supplementary use for wind energy is the production of fresh water by desalination 
using reverse osmosis, currently in preparation for Bequia under the Implementation of 
Adaptation Measures in Coastal Zones Project, with grants from the Global Environment 
Facility and under responsibility of the Ministry for Health and Environment.22
Precise wind measurements are currently made by CREDP/GTZ and VINLEC at 
Brighton and at Ribishi Point on the island of St. Vincent to get reliable data for wind 
power investments. The ridge at Ribishi Point, close to the sea and between a landfill and 
a new sanitation facility, is a good location for a small 4 to 5 MW wind farm using 
turbines with a capacity of approximately 900 kW. VINLEC has evaluated tenders for the 
supply and operation of wind turbines at these locations in 2009. VINLEC is considering 
either entering into an agreement with one of the tender proposals or investing in the 
development of the wind park on its own. Further wind measurements are needed to 
select other locations for future wind farms. 
Action 17: VINLEC, with technical assistance from CREDP/GTZ, will 
execute further long-term wind measurements on St. Vincent. Measurement 
activities will be extended to other islands with good wind potential and 
demand for wind power. Environmental impacts and ground conditions for 
turbine foundations should be assessed at selected sites, and technical and 
economical pre-feasibility studies should be executed.
Time-scale: Short - Term (long-term continuance) 
Action 18: The Ministry for Physical Development and VINLEC will 
initiate steps for the erection of wind turbines and posts for grid-connection 
as soon as possible. They will further make arrangements to allow 
conditional access and use of this property either by VINLEC or a private 
wind farm operator. The Ministry for Physical Development will initiate a 
process of land use planning, dedicating and reserving sites for the 
 
22 See World Bank Report 34152-LAC of August 8, 2006 construction of additional future wind farms. 
Time-scale: Short-term (long-term continuance) 
4.3.1.4 Biomass energy and waste-to-energy 
An assessment of the potential of different biomass residues and the availability of plants 
dedicated to electricity generation from biogas was concluded in March 2009 by GFA 
Envest GmbH in collaboration with the Caribbean Bio-Energy Technology Ltd. and the 
Government. The study identified some feedstock, such as banana trunks, that can be 
used for the production of biogas, and also examined to what extent the organic content 
of agricultural and municipal waste can be utilized for the same purpose. The study 
estimates that the realistic potential for electricity generation from biogas in St. Vincent is 
within 3 to 4 MW, and outlines a project concept for the initial development of a biogas 
plant. Further assessment will be needed to examine to what extent oil-containing seeds 
and/or other biomass sources can be used as the basis of biofuels for the transport sector 
and other purposes, such as cooking. 
Action 19: The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries will 
continue to dialogue and partner with interested private developers to seek 
funding for the development of a biogas plant for electricity generation, and 
also to further analyse the potential of using available biomass sources to 
produce biofuels for the transport sector and other energy purposes. 
Time-scale: Short-term 
4.3.1.5 Solar electricity and solar thermal use 
The potential for hot water and electricity generation depends mainly on the usable size 
(surface) of the appliances (collectors or panels) and the technology used. Medium solar 
radiation is of 5.0 kWh/d.m² throughout the region and shows little seasonal variation. 
Solar thermal energy is utilized to heat water. Nevertheless, there is still significant 
potential to expand the use of solar thermal energy. There is a significant use of electrical 
water heaters that could be replaced by solar collectors. There is a growing number of 
applications where photovoltaic panels can be used at competitive costs. Those options 
may increase significantly with the continuing decline in price of solar photovoltaic 
systems. 
Action 20: The Ministry of Energy, in collaboration with VINLEC, will 
analyse market potentials for the (extended) application of solar thermal 
and solar photovoltaic systems in all sectors. Through the Energy Unit, the 
Ministry of Energy will continue to examine the potential to fit gridconnected photovoltaic installations on Government and Public buildings 
through the initial installation of demonstration systems on at least three 
buildings that were investigated with assistance from GTZ under the 
CREDP programme. VINLEC will install a pilot photovoltaic plant at its 
own premises and will publish technical guidelines for the interconnection of small, grid-connected renewable energy systems. 
Time-scale: Short-term 
4.3.2 Applications 
4.3.2.1 Renewable energy for the Grenadine islands 
Given their remoteness and small power demand, electricity generation costs on Bequia, 
Canouan, Union and Mayreau are even higher than on the main island. On the other hand, 
those islands have a strong seasonal tourism sector that requires a clean environment and 
depends highly on competitive energy costs. Those islands have an excellent potential of 
wind as well as solar resources. This is also the case for the other smaller islands that 
have privately operated diesel-fired electricity systems. 
Action 21: The Ministry of Energy, with technical and financial support 
from international sources, will investigate opportunities to tap costeffectively wind and solar potentials for electricity generation on all major 
Grenadine islands. This includes the centralised use of such sources to be 
fed into the grid as well as the decentralised generation coupled with either 
storage systems or grid-connections to deliver excess electricity. The 
Government will also seek international financial funding for feasibility 
and planning studies as well as investments in the form of grants or softloans to raise the economic viability and lower financial risks to support 
private power operators to replace diesel fuel with RES. 
Time-scale: Short-term 
4.3.2.2 Renewable energy for self supply 
Stand-alone photovoltaic panels or small wind generators in combination with charge 
controllers and batteries can be the most economical solution for specific applications if a 
grid connection is not available or would be too expensive. 
Action 22: The Ministry of Energy, in collaboration with VINLEC and 
other public institutions, will investigate opportunities for the installation of 
stand-alone photovoltaic and wind power systems. Application areas could 
include street lighting, air field lighting, cattle fences, telecommunication 
towers etc. The Government will consider how to promote private 
investments and provide appropriate technical information. 
Time-scale: Short-term 4.3.3 Stimulus tools 
4.3.3.1 Independent power production 
Currently the Electricity Supply Act (ESA) does not allow for the engagement of 
Independent Power Producers in SVG, unless they have been authorized by VINLEC 
with the consent of the Ministry responsible for electricity supply. However, given the 
high investment costs required for the construction of new generation facilities, which 
may exceed the financial capabilities of VINLEC, the participation of new and 
experienced stakeholders in the exploitation of new wind and geothermal resources could 
be essential for the deployment of new generation facilities of this type. 
Action 23: The Ministry of Energy, with international assistance, will 
either amend the Electricity Supply Act in such a form that it allows for the 
generation of electricity from renewable energy sources by Independent 
Power Producers, or mandate VINLEC to issue sub-licences for electricity 
generation activities whenever the Government instructs it to do so. 
VINLEC will maintain its role as sole-buyer, transmitter and distributor of 
electricity. It will purchase the power that comes exclusively from 
renewable energy sources from any IPP on the basis of long-term bilateral 
power purchase agreements. The Government will act as supervisor in this 
process, unless a neutral regulatory body is delegated with such power. 
Time-scale: Short-term 
4.3.3.2 Net-metering 
Currently parallel operation with the public grid and feed-in of excess electricity is not 
allowed without prior licensing by VINLEC even in cases where renewable energy is 
used for self-supply, or produced at small-scale. On the other hand, easy to implement 
net-metering schemes for small electricity generators using renewable energy has not yet 
been officially established. A first grid-connected PV installation based on a bilateral netmetering agreement with VINLEC has gone into operation at St. Vincent Technical 
College in May 2008. 
Action 24: The Ministry of Energy will change the legal basis to allow 
for indiscriminate supply of electricity to the main grid from small 
generators using renewable energy, without prior licensing by VINLEC. 
The Government, in collaboration with VINLEC, will also implement a 
suitable net-metering scheme for such electricity. 
Time-scale: Short-term 4.4 Petroleum sector  
GOAL: Increase energy security and diversify the energy portfolio 
4.4.1 Contracts and agreements for energy supply and storage 
SVG traditionally imports petroleum supplies from Trinidad and, as necessary, purchases 
on the spot market. Oil reserves in the Latin American and Caribbean region are 
estimated at 52.5 to 129 billion barrels (Gb),23 while natural gas reserves are estimated at 
250 trillion cubic feet. Within the vicinity of SVG, only Venezuela possesses long-term 
petroleum resources. 
Over the years, SVG has benefitted from energy agreements, such as the Petrocaribe and 
Texaco, which form an important part of the energy security strategy and involve access 
to refined products under financing agreements. 
Action 25: It is important for the country to preserve benefits negotiated 
under bilateral energy supply agreements. The Government’s foreign trade 
policy will seek to strengthen bilateral relationships with energy supplying 
countries within, and outside of, the region, such as the petroleum supply 
contract signed with the Government of Venezuela under the auspices of 
the PETROCARIBE agreement. The Government, in line with other 
countries of the region, will further support any policy that seeks to set up 
new refinery capacities in addition to existing facilities, if such option 
demonstrates clear economic advantages and is consistent with existing 
socio-environmental regulations. 
Time-scale: Short-term (long-term continuance) 
4.4.2 Petroleum reserve storage 
Unexpected oil supply disruptions due to national or international events, such as natural 
disasters, geopolitical instability, or acts of terrorism, must be prevented. With the 
commissioning of the first phase of the new diesel generating plant at Lowmans Bay in 
2006, VINLEC created 440,000 imperial gallons of fuel storage capacity to operate the 
plant. An additional 440,000 imperial gallons is to be added with the second phase of 
expansion of the plant scheduled for 2010. Additionally, the Government, through the 
PetroCaribe Agreement, is in the process of constructing a national fuel storage facility 
at Lowmans Bay that will expand storage capacity for petroleum products including 
possibly fuel for the transport sector and LPG. 
 
23 Energy Watch Group. Crude Oil – The supply Outlook. Revised Edition February 2008. Action 26: The Government will revise existing regulations, or submit 
new legislation to Parliament, in order to ensure adequate inventory levels 
to cushion any disruption in the supply of fossil fuels. 
Time-scale: Medium-term 
4.4.3 Diversification of energy sources
Considering the potential for renewable and non-renewable energy development in Saint 
Vincent and the Grenadines and the current technological advances, energy resources 
such as liquefied or piped natural gas, biomass, wind, geothermal, solar and other sources 
of energy must be considered in the future energy mix. Furthermore, it is essential to 
explore interconnection options between and among St. Vincent, the Grenadine islands 
and neighbouring nations. This strategy would enable the creation of a new export market 
for excess energy from SVG and strengthen energy security at the national and regional 
levels. 
Action 27: The Government will promote the diversification of energy 
sources to reduce SVG’s dependence on a single fuel type for the 
generation of electricity and heat, and for the transport sector. Natural gas 
and renewable energy sources (see section 4.3 above) are among the 
alternatives which will be further explored. For such purpose, the Ministry 
of Energy will mandate the preparation of a study on options to import 
liquefied or compressed natural gas. 
Time-scale: Short-term and long-term 
4.5 Transport sector
GOAL: Reduce projected consumption of fossil fuels in the transport
sector by 10% by 2015 and 15% by 2020.
4.5.1 Reduced fuel consumption of vehicles
Vehicles vary considerably in fuel consumption depending on engine technology and 
size. Medium-sized, 5-passenger vehicles show average standard fuel efficiency ranging 
from 39 to more than 98 kilometres per imperial gallon, the latter being the case of 
hybrid vehicles. Older vehicles and those without regular engine maintenance generally 
tend to be less efficient. 
Many vehicle owners have no knowledge of the vehicle’s specific fuel consumption.24
Furthermore, motor vehicle property tax does not take into consideration fuel efficiency. 
 
24 In the case of new vehicles, this information is available from international sources. For example, in the 
European Union, the United States and Japan, vehicle manufacturers are required by law to provide fuel 
consumption figures for the vehicles they produce. This allows consumers to make a more informed 
decision when purchasing a vehicle. On the other hand, fuel subsidies geared at lowering fuel prices are a heavy burden on the 
state budget. 
Action 28: The Ministry of Energy, in collaboration with the Bureau of 
Standards, will provide the public with specific fuel consumption 
guidelines for different vehicles commonly imported to SVG. In order to 
stimulate the purchase of lower fuel consumption vehicles, the Ministry of 
Finance will revise the motor vehicle taxation system and base it 
principally on fuel efficiency instead of engine size. The Government will 
reconsider its policy of subsidizing fuel so as to stimulate the use of more 
efficient vehicles. It will also assess whether the current environment levy 
on imported second-hand vehicles is effectively addressing the issue of 
energy efficiency. 
Time-scale: Short-term 
4.5.2 Transport strategy  
Reducing energy consumption in the transport sector can contribute to achieve a greater 
level of independence from fossil fuel imports. A new transport strategy should be 
implemented to lower energy consumption in the transport of goods and persons in the 
private, industrial, commercial and public sector. Such a strategy should include options 
aimed at reducing the number of vehicles, improving public transport and road 
conditions, and implement an innovative traffic management approach. 
Action 29: The Ministry of Transport will develop a comprehensive 
long-term transport strategy to curb energy consumption in this sector, 
including rush-hour regulations, staggered business hours, and access and 
use of heavy load vehicles during rush hours. It will highlight measures that 
will reduce the number of road transports, introduce new public buses and 
regulate public transport routes throughout the island, improve the current 
road network and make recommendations for innovative traffic 
management. 
Time-scale: Medium to long-term 
Action 30: The Government, in cooperation with VINLEC, will study the 
potential for introducing hybrid and electric vehicles into the island. As a 
first step, the Government can introduce electric vehicles into its own fleet. 
Time-scale: Medium-term 
4.5.3 Biofuels for transport
Ethanol can easily be blended with gasoline up to a volume of 10% in most vehicle 
engines. Higher ethanol contents can be used in vehicles with modified engines. 
Biodiesel can also be either mixed with regular diesel, or used as single fuel in many cars. Diesel engines can also be modified to run on pure plant oil. 
Action 31: The Government will study the setup of a national (and 
possibly regional) biofuels production chain. Production would be 
supplemented with imports from countries such as Brazil if needed. The 
Government will look into options to cooperate with regional refinery 
operators and fuel suppliers to set up appropriate supply mechanisms for 
fuel blends (gasoline/ethanol and diesel/biodiesel). 
Time-scale: Short-term 
4.6 Energy efficiency
GOAL: Reduce projected electricity generation by 5% by 2015 and 15%
by 2020
4.6.1 Assessment of market potential 
An analysis of technical potential is required for the energy efficiency market. There are 
numerous opportunities for electricity savings through conservation, the use of highefficiency technologies, and better demand management. Statistics on energy demand are 
scarce, and demand side management has been the subject of little analysis. In order to 
implement measures for the improvement of energy efficiency and assess their impact on 
energy supply, there is a strong need to identify and assess key market potentials. 
Action 32: The Ministry of Energy, with the support of stake-holders and 
international consultants, will analyse the structure of the energy 
consumption sector and its potential for improved efficiency. VINLEC will 
take over the task of analysing the consumption patterns of different 
consumer groups, and establish consumer profiles. 
Time-scale: Short-term 
4.6.2 Co-generation 
Hospitals, hotels and the food-processing industry require electricity and heat, the latter 
being used for hot water, steam and air conditioning. The waste heat occurring in these 
thermal generation processes can be recovered and transformed into useful energy, thus 
raising overall efficiency. Decentralized co-generation facilities located at the site of 
consumption are widely utilized in many developed countries, and should also be 
deployed in SVG. Electricity would be provided for local consumption, with excess 
power being delivered to the grid. In this case, as well as in the case of self-generators 
using renewable energy, remuneration schemes such as net-metering or fixed feed-in 
tariffs should be introduced in the legislation by amending the Electricity Supply Act, or 
through specific legislation. Action 33: The Government will support all activities that contribute to 
higher energy efficiency by using co-generation facilities in the industrial 
and service sector. For this purpose, VINLEC will showcase the use of 
waste heat from its generation facilities in combination with absorption 
chillers for cooling of its office buildings and work space. The Government 
will amend the Electricity Supply Act (ESA) or mandate VINLEC to issue 
required licenses in order to provide the legal basis for the parallel 
operation of co-generation plants with the public grid. The Ministry of 
Energy, in collaboration with VINLEC, will be mandated to analyse the 
conditions for feed-in of excess electricity and support of back-up and 
reserve power. Preferential treatment will be given to plants that use 
sustainably grown biofuels as their main feedstock. 
Time-scale: Short-term 
4.6.3 Energy efficiency in buildings 
Residential, commercial and public buildings consume large amounts of energy, 
especially for cooling and lighting. To date, insufficient attention has been afforded to the 
design and energy performance of these buildings, or to construction components and 
materials. In fact, there are currently no regulations and/or standards in place directed 
towards thermal efficiency and energy end-use efficiency in buildings. 
Action 34: The Government, in collaboration with the Bureau of 
Standards, will encourage the application of building technologies and 
practices that enhance energy efficiency and conservation. For such 
purpose, the Bureau of Standards —preferably in collaboration with 
institutions in other Caribbean countries— will publish information on 
materials and components suitable for the construction of well-insulated 
buildings and the rehabilitation of existing buildings. It will disseminate 
such information among architects, civil engineers, construction 
companies, and the general public. It will also present guidelines for energy 
efficient building designs that lead to reduced cooling loads and improved 
day lighting, and issue instructions on how to properly insulate buildings 
against overheating, avoid cooling losses, use natural ventilation and install 
efficient lighting and air-conditioning systems. 
Time-scale: Short-term 
4.6.4 Energy efficiency in lighting 
Lighting is one of the main areas of electricity consumption in the residential and 
commercial sector. Despite activities to replace inefficient light bulbs by energy saving 
fluorescent lamps (e.g., through an initiative lead by Cuba in 2004), and tax incentives for 
the purchase of compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), incandescent light bulbs continue to 
be sold and used in SVG. The European Union, Australia, and the United States are 
gradually banning the use and sale of incandescent light bulbs. Replacing them with more efficient lights may reduce electricity consumption for lighting by up to 80%. In 
order to guarantee that consumers get only quality products, standards and certification 
systems, such as the Energy Star program in the United States, have been put in place in a 
number of countries, or are currently being discussed. 
Action 35: The Ministry of Energy will consider further fiscal incentives 
to encourage the use of energy efficient lighting devices, such as compact 
fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and phase 
out the use of incandescent light bulbs. Through the Bureau of Standards, 
the Government will implement the necessary measures to prevent the 
import of low-quality CFLs. Such policy should be harmonized with steps 
taken in other countries of the region. The action must take place in parallel 
to information campaigns that provide information on the economic and 
environmental benefits derived from CFLs, and the aid provided by the 
government. 
Time-scale: Short-term 
4.6.5 Energy savings through solar water heaters 
Hot water for private dwellings and large-scale consumers, such as hotels, restaurants and 
hospitals, can be produced almost exclusively through solar energy given SVG's climate 
conditions, thus avoiding the use of electricity, reducing peak loads and replacing the use 
of fossil energy, such as LPG. So far, the use of solar water heaters is limited mainly to 
part of the residential sector and to small tourism facilities. 
Action 36: The Ministry of Energy will bolster the introduction of solar 
water heaters in SVG and consider measures to reduce investment costs. 
For such purpose, it will enforce a regulation to exempt solar thermal 
collectors and related components from import duties, instead of the current 
case-by-case decisions. The Government will further consider the provision 
of low-interest loans (e.g., through the state-owned Commercial Bank or 
VINLEC) or tax credits, in order to lower the burden of initial costs. For all 
new buildings with hot-water needs (in particular in the residential and 
service sector) the installation of solar thermal collectors will be made 
mandatory. 
Time-scale: Short-term 
4.6.6 Energy savings through energy efficient appliances 
All of the major appliances sold or used in SVG are imported from overseas. There is a 
low public awareness of the energy efficiency of those appliances, which can vary 
substantially between different manufacturers and products, even if the services provided 
by those appliances are comparable. In the US, EU, Japan, Brazil and many other 
markets, the use of labelling schemes for domestic appliances (like washing machines, 
air-conditioners, refrigerators, freezers etc.) and electronic office equipment (like monitors, personal computers, printers etc.), as well as setting the Minimum Energy 
Performance Standards and adequate certification of compliance is quite common and 
mandatory for a number of product types. Such labels give an indication about the grade 
of energy efficiency and inform the consumers about the energy consumption under 
defined conditions. 
Action 37: The Ministry of Energy, in collaboration with the Bureau of 
Standards, will enact legislation requiring that all major domestic 
appliances, such as refrigerators, freezers, washing machines, dishwashers 
and air conditioners, imported and sold in SVG carry a label stating their 
energy consumption and their compliance with predefined minimum 
energy performance standards. The labels shall comply with the rules of the 
European Appliance Labelling system, the United States Energy Star 
program, or any other reputable labelling scheme. Consideration will also 
be given to the banning of imports of products which do not fulfil 
minimum energy performance standards. Imports of goods that are not 
appropriately labelled or certified will be either forbidden or subject to 
extra taxation. The Ministry of Energy, in collaboration with other 
ministries and the Bureau of Standards, will analyse the current appliance 
market, harmonize actions with regard to labelling and determination of 
energy performance standards with other countries in the region, draft the 
necessary laws and regulations, and propose adequate public awareness 
activities. The new legislation shall be consistent with similar laws adopted 
by other countries of the region with the same purpose. 
Time-scale: Short-term 
4.6.7 Public sector energy efficiency measures 
4.6.7.1 Government buildings 
Government buildings as well as other public buildings can act as a showcase for modern 
energy efficient construction. It will also encourage other public institutions and local 
authorities to act accordingly in order to save financial resources. 
Action 38: The Ministry of Energy, through the Energy Unit, will set up 
an inter-ministerial energy efficiency programme that will undertake a 
comprehensive energy study of the of all Government owned/operated 
buildings, including ministries, post offices, police stations, and health and 
educational facilities, among others. The study will identify the buildings to 
be audited, evaluate and analyse their current conditions, the various 
measures that could be implemented to reduce energy consumption and 
improve efficiency, and assess the buildings’ energy supply through solar 
energy and/or small wind technology. New constructions and major 
refurbishments will be guided by the principle of low energy consumption 
for cooling, lighting and hot water needs. This includes the minimisation of artificial lighting to the extent necessary, the incorporation of shading, the 
use of natural air flow and the use of insulation materials in architectural 
designs. 
Time-scale: Short-term 
4.6.7.2 Public procurement 
The Government and the public institutions are major energy consumers. Together, they 
form a strong market force by purchasing electrical and electronic equipment as well as 
vehicles and other energy consuming devices. Public institutions funded by taxpayers 
have therefore a particular responsibility to use energy wisely and rationally, and to 
reduce its waste to the lowest level possible. 
Action 39: The Ministry of Energy will set rules for the procurement of 
all energy consuming goods and devices to be used by public institutions. 
Such rules will establish specific maximum energy consumptions. The 
Government will purchase and consume as much electricity and fuel as 
possible generated from indigenous renewable sources, therefore 
contributing to reduce dependence on imported fossil fuel. The reports of 
the energy efficiency studies of Government/Public buildings will be used 
to assist with the definition of such rules. 
Time-scale: Short-term 
4.6.7.3 Training and information of public staff 
The lack, or insufficient knowledge, of how to efficiently handle equipment is a 
considerable cause of energy waste.. 
Action 40: The Ministry of Energy and the public sector in its entirety 
shall implement public awareness campaigns aimed at promoting the 
rational use of energy and lower energy consumption. Energy conservation 
guidelines will be published. The SFA funded Energy Efficiency study of 
Government Buildings to be conducted in 2010 will deliver, as part of its 
scope of works, a Public Education and Awareness Program for 
Government employees.
