About the RRA
A Renewables Readiness Assessment (RRA) is a holistic evaluation of a country’s conditions that helps to identify 
the actions needed to overcome barriers to renewable energy deployment. This is a country-led process, with IRENA 
primarily providing technical support and expertise to facilitate consultations among different national stakeholders. 
While the RRA helps to shape appropriate policy and regulatory choices, each country determines the best mix of 
renewable energy sources and technologies to achieve national priorities. The RRA is a dynamic process that can 
be adapted to each country’s circumstances and needs. IRENA has continually refined its methodology for the RRA 
process based on experience in a growing range of countries and regions.

from the Minister of 
Energy and Water
Increased access to sustainable energy in households and economic 
sectors the country is at the heart of energy development prospects, with 
the ultimate ambition to support the government’s commitment to reduce 
poverty and boost the national economy.
This strategic orientation is justified by low levels of access to energy 
services, still below national targets and indicators. In fact, energy access is 
mainly characterised by electrification rates, which are above 41% nationally 
but barely 17% in rural areas; cooking highly dependent on wood energy, 
albeit with encouraging penetration of alternative fuels and technologies; 
hydropower and solar resources that are not sufficiently utilised; expanding 
bioenergy use, which offers particular opportunities for rural communities; 
private investments in progress; energy demand growing rapidly, at about 
15% yearly; and a singularly vulnerable living environment.
One can easily understand, then, the commitment of the Government of 
Mali to strengthening national policies and strategies, as well as specific 
laws and regulations, in the energy sector. The government’s commitment 
has led to the ongoing revision of major framework documents, such as the 
National Energy Policy, the Rural Electrification Reference Framework, and 
the Presidential Ordinance of March 2000, on the organisation of the power 
sector.
Additionally, the development of an “Investor’s Guide”, standardised tender 
documentation and power purchase agreement (PPA) formats, and training 
for staff in the energy sector should help in implementing our national 
strategic energy guidelines. Through all these actions, the Government of 
Mali, through the Ministry of Energy and Water, aims to give national energy 
stakeholders a framework for the rapid development of sustainable energy 
projects and programmes.The Ministry of Energy and Water will work to achieve the government’s 
aims, including Mali’s commitment to the regional energy framework of 
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Nationally 
Determined Contributions (NDCs) stemming from the Paris Agreement, and 
other international agreements pertaining to energy.
The Ministry, working through the Mali Renewable Energy Agency (AER-Mali), 
has initiated a partnership with the International Renewable Energy Agency 
(IRENA) to assess Mali’s readiness to scale up renewables. With the support 
of IRENA, AER-Mali and various national actors, carried out a rigorous and 
objective diagnosis of the development of the renewable energy subsector, 
with concrete recommendations that we can convert into action. This report 
will introduce you to the methodology, conclusions and recommendations of 
the assessment, including the identification of key “Resource-Service” pairs.
Beyond that, I call on everyone to mobilise on these issues, so that bioenergy 
and other renewables become the engines for the energy sector to bloom, 
with the end-goal of a sustainable economic growth for Mali.
His Excellency M. Sambou Wagué
Minister of Energy and Water, MaliFOREWORD
from the IRENA
Director-General
Mali has vast resource potential for the development of renewable energy. 
Renewable-based technologies could strengthen agriculture, drive sustainable 
rural development and improve food security, as well as expanding energy 
access and boosting climate-resilience. By harnessing solar, wind and 
bioenergy resources in line with the National Renewable Energy Action 
Plan (PANER) for 2030, Mali could do much to reduce poverty and improve 
people’s livelihoods, while setting a valuable example of sustainable energy 
development for all Sahel countries. 
With less than one fifth of the rural population enjoying the benefits of 
electricity access, decentralised renewables have emerged as a crucial socioeconomic development solution. Generation capacity from biomass could 
reach 2.2 gigawatts by 2030, while solar and wind power have the potential to 
contribute even more impressively in the long run. 
This Renewables Readiness Assessment (RRA) presents clear and practical 
steps for Mali to make maximum use of renewables to drive sustainable 
economic growth. The assessment process underlined the need to adopt a 
broader range of renewable-based technologies and diversify the country’s 
power supply through increased use of non-hydro options. The updated 
technology mix would create considerable socio-economic value, especially 
with climate change taken fully into account.
The report recommends policy and regulatory measures to encourage privatesector participation in renewable energy projects, both on and off the national 
grid. A grid code, meanwhile, must be adopted to encourage the integration 
of variable sources like solar and wind power. Alongside these technical 
considerations, meanwhile, the human factor will be of paramount importance. 
In addition to clear quality standards for renewable energy equipment, Mali 
would benefit from enhanced capacities to develop, appraise and finance 
bankable projects.Since 2011, nearly 40 countries, spanning the Africa, the Middle East, Latin 
America and the Caribbean, Asia and the Pacific have undertaken RRAs, 
exchanging knowledge and fostering international co-operation to accelerate 
the deployment of renewables. Each process has been country-led, with IRENA 
providing technical expertise and highlighting regional and global insights, 
along with facilitating consultations among different national stakeholders.
IRENA is very grateful to the Malian authorities, and particularly the Ministry of 
Energy and Water and the Mali Renewable Energy Agency, for their commitment 
to this study. We appreciate the positive engagement and valuable input from 
multiple stakeholders. I am confident that the recommendations in this report 
will strengthen the pursuit of renewable energy solutions in Mali and across 
the region.

Mali is a landlocked country and is one of the largest in Africa, with an area 
of 1 241 238 square kilometres and an estimated population of 19.6 million 
in 2018. The country has been experiencing high demographic growth at a 
3.36% annual rate over the 2010-18 period (PopulationData.net, 2019).
Furthermore, there is an imbalance in the distribution of population between 
rural and urban areas, with more than 70% located in the former while 
those in the latter mainly concentrate in the regional capitals as well as 
the District of Bamako, a city of over 4.3 million inhabitants in 2018. Mali 
remains one of the poorest countries in the world, with a gross domestic 
product of USD 15.29 billion in 2017; that is, only USD 825 per capita. On 
average, agriculture and services account for approximately 80% of Mali’s 
gross domestic product although final energy consumption for both sectors 
remains below 8%.
Mali is involved with the major regional political, financial and sectoral 
institutions. As a member of the Economic Community of West African States 
(ECOWAS), the country is part of the ECOWAS Energy Protocol, adopted in 
2003. Mali also is part of the West African Economic and Monetary Union 
(Union Economique et Monétaire Ouest Africain, UEMOA) and the Permanent 
Interstate Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel (Comité Inter-état 
de Lutte contre la Sècheresse au Sahel, CILSS), which bring together ten 
countries within the Sudano-Sahelian zone.
In terms of electricity, Mali is a key member of the Senegal River Basin 
Development Organization shared by Guinea, Mali, Mauritania and Senegal. 
Within this organisation, Mali has participated in the construction and 
development of the Manantali and Félou hydropower plants. Mali is a 
member of the West African Power Pool, a specialised institution under 
ECOWAS whose aim is to integrate the operations of national power systems 
into a unified regional electricity block. In addition, the country belongs to 
the ECOWAS Regional Electricity Regulatory Authority responsible for crossborder electricity exchange regulation.
Mali depends entirely on imported petroleum products and wood fuel 
(wood energy) from its natural forests. The country also imports electricity 
from neighbouring countries. This negatively impacts Mali’s environmental 
stability and the country’s balance of payments. There are, nevertheless, 
unproven oil reserves that await extensive exploration in the northern and 
eastern parts of the country.
Access to electricity in Mali as in the majority of countries in the ECOWAS 
region is low, with sharp disparities across urban and rural areas. Only half 
of the urban population has access to electricity whereas in the rural areas, 
access is limited to only 16.7% of the population. As far as modern fuels for 
cooking are concerned, access is extremely low, at only 2% and 3% for rural 
and urban areas, respectively.
Mali’s electricity system encompasses a national grid that is owned and 
operated by Energie du Mali SA (EDM SA) which supplies 35 towns, including 
Bamako. In addition to the national grid, EDM SA manages 30 isolated 
centres equipped with diesel generators and two centres supplied by Côte 
d’Ivoire. The Malian Agency for Domestic Energy and Rural Electrification 
(Agence Malienne pour le Développement de l’Energie Domestique et 
de l’Electrification Rurale - AMADER) is in charge of rural electrification 
for schemes below 250 kW and is the regulator for rural electrification in 
dith thffk f l ltifitidtd Hydropower and thermal power stations are the main 
energy generation sources at the national level. Although 
hybrid (solar/diesel) and small-scale decentralised 
solar photovoltaic (PV) systems have been increasingly 
installed since 2011, the share of renewable energy, 
excluding large hydropower, remains low.
 
Mali continues to face major challenges in the electricity 
sector. Hydropower accounts for 51% of installed 
capacity; however, rainfall and hydrological changes 
have an impact on electricity generation and, as a result, 
Mali increasingly is resorting to oil-powered stations. 
Due to the high generation costs from thermal power 
stations and excessive technical and non-technical 
network losses, tariffs are particularly high apart from 
the social tariffs offered when consumption is below 
50 kilowatt hours per month.
These challenges mean that other opportunities 
in renewables should be sought, particularly the 
options of on-grid and off-grid solar PV. Indeed, Mali 
is endowed with a large spectrum of renewables, 
including sustainable biomass if adequately managed. 
The national forest estate is estimated at 100 million 
hectares. The main challenge is to ensure the sustainable 
use of this resource to maintain pace with the natural 
productivity of forests. As for hydropower, although it 
already accounts for a significant share of electricity 
capacity and generation, there is still a considerable 
untapped potential, subject to further studies.
The impact of climate change, however, also must be 
taken into account to ensure a secure electricity supply 
over the long term. The International Renewable Energy 
Agency (IRENA) has carried out a comprehensive study 
on the planning and prospects for renewables in West 
Africa. Solar energy particularly solar PV has the most 
potential. Tapping only 2% of the solar PV potential was 
sufficient to cover total electricity supply in 2015. 
The Malian National Renewable Energy Action Plan 
(NREAP) has set ambitious objectives for grid- and offgrid systems alike. For a connected system, installed 
capacity by 2030 for renewables, including large hydro, 
should reach 1 416 megawatts (MW); that is, a nine-fold 
increase compared to 2010. For off-grid renewables, 
installed capacity should increase from 20 MW in 2010 
to over 600 MW by 2030, a thirtyfold increase over 
the period. Ambitious targets have also been set for 
ethanol and biodiesel. 
The findings of the Renewable Readiness Assessment 
(RRA) highlight the key bottlenecks that hinder the 
widespread deployment of renewables systems. They 
identify critical actions that could significantly impact 
the scale-up of RE in the short-to-medium term. In 
this context, Mali is offered various recommendations, 
highlighted below
Diversify the power supply through increased 
penetration of non-hydropower renewables
In its National Adaptation Programme of Action, Mali 
highlights the vulnerability of its energy sector to 
climate change by ranking it as the third most imperilled 
sector following agriculture and health. Indeed, given 
its heavy reliance on hydropower, the entire energy 
system is under the threat of climate change impact, 
suggesting the prioritisation and more accelerated 
deployment of renewable energy technologies beyond 
hydropower, such as solar and biomass. 
Mali is therefore advised to develop a power sector 
master plan that captures, fully, cost-effective and 
sustainable renewable solutions. This should also be 
complemented by an assessment of various bioenergy 
resource potentials as well as an overall policy that 
takes into account other sectorial strategies. A thorough 
assessment of hydropower, including its current 
status and further development options in light of 
hydrological projections, is also advisable. The support 
of international partners, such as the Green Climate 
Fund and the Global Environment Facility, should be 
sought for the development and implementation of a 
long-term climate change resilience strategy. 
Develop and adopt an electricity grid code
Mali is still characterised by the absence of a grid 
code. Accommodating a large share of renewables 
in the near future implies developing and codifying 
operational procedures to respond to power generation 
forecasts as well as undertaking further studies 
regarding grid stability. It will also require a grid 
code to ensure procedures that are conducive to the 
technical integration of variable renewables (solar and 
wind) into the grid. This can take the form of a law or 
a directive that mandates compliance to a grid code by 
all generators.
Enhance the enabling framework for private renewable 
energy investments
According to assessments conducted by the World 
Bank and other international institutions, Mali is thought 
to have a relatively weak supportive policy framework 
that deters international private investors that are often 
risk averse. The Malian government is thus advised 
to adopt stronger renewable energy policy support 
mechanisms. The national private sector, furthermore, 
is scarcely involved in the development of large-scale 
power plants. This mainly is due to an insufficiently 
incentivising framework and the mechanisms to 
effectively offset the risks taken by renewable energy 
investors. Adopting measures to mitigate off-taker risks 
is essential for the ramp up of mature renewable energy 
projects that already have been initiated by the private Adopt policies and regulations that support the 
growing mini-grid sector
Rural electrification is a major challenge in Mali. The 
general principle is that electricity prices in rural 
areas are not regulated but capped to USD 0.51/kWh. 
As a result and despite AMADER’s support to rural 
electrification electricity tariffs applied to the rural 
poor, who are not connected to the main grid or to 
isolated centres, are extremely high and range between 
USD 0.25/kWh and 0.51/kWh. This is largely due to 
the large share of thermal installations and represents 
an opportunity to for deployment of sustainable 
energy with the prospects of reduced production 
costs. Revising the tariff-setting mechanisms for rural 
electrification would, therefore, be pertinent. Price 
equalisation and support to the private sector must be 
considered to overcome this major challenge of high 
electricity tariffs in rural areas. 
Develop a clear main grid arrival policy
The RRA process highlighted that within the mini-grid 
sub-sector, there is great uncertainty as to what occurs 
to existing mini-grids when they are reached by grid 
extension campaigns. This uncertainty is generally 
linked to the inappropriate application of the provisions 
in force regarding takeover or retrocession between the 
State and private operators and constitutes a risk to 
private investors in rural electrification. Mali could learn 
from the best practices of other countries in order to 
apply the prevailing measures or adopt an appropriate 
model to mitigate that risk.
Implement quality control standards for renewable 
energy equipment and installers
RRA discussions have highlighted the relative lack of 
standards and adequately qualified technicians for 
the sizing, design, instalment and maintenance of 
solar systems in the country. To sustain this effort, the 
Government of Mali may wish to consider equipping 
its Renewable Energy Agency (–AER-Mali) with the 
appropriate laboratory and other equipment to test 
locally manufactured and imported products. Mali 
could also benefit from the ECREEE-led and IRENAsupported ECOWAS Certification of Sustainable Energy 
Skills, as a way to equip the local market with highquality technicians to curb the country’s technical skills 
shortage.
Enhance technical capacities for a large-scale 
deployment of renewable power
Technical and human capacities across the value chain, 
readiness of support institutions and grid infrastructure 
must be assessed to support Mali’s preparedness for 
the integration of higher shares of variable renewable 
power. This assessment should ideally be followed by 
capacity-building efforts to bridge the gaps identified. 
Priority areas for capacity building should include 
streamlining existing institutional and regulatory 
frameworks as well as addressing the main bottlenecks, 
particularly the legal and technical issues that surround 
independent power producers, power purchase 
agreements, financing and guarantee mechanisms, 
certification and normalisation. Given the variability of 
renewables and possible disturbance on the grid, power 
generation forecasts and reliable and comprehensive 
renewable energy data are the other key areas to be 
prioritised to build capacities in the renewable energy 
sector.
Strengthen local capacities in the development, 
appraisal and financing of bankable renewable 
energy projects
In addition to the policy and regulatory frameworks 
mentioned above, the current low level of local private 
sector involvement in renewable energy investments 
also relates to the lack of awareness of the local financial 
sector of the technicalities and business proposition 
in investing in renewables. This leads to the high-risk 
perception of renewable energy projects. Dedicated 
efforts should be channelled towards bringing potential 
players to the same level of knowledge, albeit by 
tailoring it to their specific needs.
Establish effective energy data collection and 
management processes to build capacities
As in the case of most countries in sub-Saharan Africa, 
the quest for reliable, consistent and up-to-date data 
essential for understanding, not only the potential but 
also the energy situation in Mali, is often a daunting 
task. Statistical capacity-building activities are 
recommended to strengthen renewable energy data 
collection, processing and dissemination.Mali’s capital city, BamakoI. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Country Background
Mali is a landlocked country with an area of 1 241 238 square kilometres 
and an estimated population of 19.6 million as of 2018. Two large rivers, 
the Senegal River (800 km) and the Niger River (1 700 km), cross Mali. The 
country has been experiencing high demographic growth at 3.3% per annum. 
Furthermore, the population is unevenly distributed between rural and urban 
areas, with more than 70% located in the former. The urban population 
mainly concentrates in the regional capital as well as the District of Bamako 
which had over 4.3 million inhabitants in 2018.
 
The negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth experienced in 2012 
(-0.8%) and low growth of 2.3% registered in 2013 have reversed, with GDP 
growth now recorded at approximately 5.97% and 5.8% in 2015 and 2016, 
respectively, although it slipped back to 5.4% in 2017. 
Mali remains one of the poorest countries in the world, with a GDP of 
USD 17.2 billion in 2017, indicating a GDP per capita of only USD 901.

1.2 Role of energy in the 
 development of Mali
Energy is a key input in the economic and social 
development of all countries, as shown by the strong 
correlation between GDP, the Human Development 
Index and the energy demand historically witnessed in 
most economies. In Mali, energy consumption across the 
major economic sectors, notably the industrial sector, is 
low. As shown in Figure 2, the industrial sector accounted 
for only 5.4% of energy consumption in 2014, the bulk 
of which is concentrated within a few sub-sectors of the 
industrial sector, particularly that of mining.
Mali is a rural country that relies heavily on agriculture 
and services. Despite the predominance of traditional 
agriculture portrayed by the low level of energy 
consumption and the resulting low yields, for instance, 
agriculture contributes significantly to Mali’s GDP. In 
2017, the agriculture sector accounted for approximately 
38.33% of GDP (World Bank, 2017a).
The low level of energy demand in Mali’s agriculture 
sector is reflective of rain-fed agriculture practices, 
characterised by low outputs. This indicates that there 
exists potential to mechanise the sector, increase output 
and, therefore, contribute to sustainable economic 
growth and transformation. Mechanisation of the sector 
in this manner would likely increase a demand for energy.
In addition to agriculture, energy is a key enabler for 
improved health services, since access to electricity plays 
a critical role in the functionality of healthcare facilities. 
Energy also plays an important role in the quality, 
accessibility and reliability of health services delivered 
to rural communities, a major challenge in sub-Saharan 
Africa where one in four sub-Saharan health facilities do 
not have access to electricity (WHO, 2014).

 Assessment process
The RRA process in Mali was led by the Renewable Energy 
Agency of Mali (Agence des Energies Renouvelables 
du Mali - AER-Mali) and the Ministry of Energy and 
Water (Ministère de l’Energie et de l’Eau, MEE), with the 
support of IRENA and various international and national 
consultants. AER-Mali invited experts drawn by key 
institutions from the government, private sector and civil 
society. They were briefed on the nature and purpose 
of the RRA process and became a part of the Mali RRA 
country team.
A kick-off meeting was conducted in April 2017 and 
included the identification of renewable energy serviceresource pairs, prioritisation criteria, and the completion 
of a set of templates for each renewable energy serviceresource pair. A final RRA validation workshop, held 
in September 2017, concluded the study and drew 
the necessary actions to set the renewable energy 
sub-sectors in motion.
This report contains four chapters, the first of which 
includes a country background brief of Mali, the role of 
its energy sector in terms of development and its RRA 
process. 
The second chapter presents an overview of the regional 
energy setting, contextualising Mali’s national energy 
sector, the challenges it faces and the potential and use 
of renewables. It also provides an in-depth discussion of 
Mali’s electricity sector.
The third chapter lists the institutions that play a role 
in Mali’s energy sector, defines key energy policies and 
regulatory frameworks and outlines the conditions for 
financing and investing in Mali.
The fourth and final chapter not only discusses the 
findings of the RRA process relating to the emerging 
concerns and conditions for scaling up the serviceresource pairs that have been identified; it also sums up 
the relevant opportunities and constraints.

2.1. Regional context
Mali is a member of the Economic Community of West African States 
(ECOWAS). The organisation works with its 15 member states1 and 
international development partners on economic development in priority 
development areas, including the improvement of energy production, 
distribution and consumption within the region. Part of this mandate lies in 
increasing access to and reliability of energy services, in particular to support 
member states in their energy transition process.
As an ECOWAS member, Mali forms a part of the ECOWAS Energy Protocol 
that was adopted in 2003, a legal framework that aims to promote long-term 
co-operation based on building relationships that are mutually beneficial 
to increase energy sector investment in the region. In terms of trade, the 
ECOWAS Energy Protocol provides for, among its other principles, thirdparty access to the grid and a right to the transit of energy.
Mali also is a member of the West African Economic Monetary Union (Union 
Economique et Monétaire Ouest Africain, UEMOA), which encompasses eight 
West African countries.2
 UEMOA’s objective is to reach 82% of electricity 
from renewables, including large hydropower by 2030. As far as the energy 
transition is concerned, UEMOA has carried out an installation study for 
large solar power plants, identifying five sites - which include Mali - for a 
total capacity of 574 megawatts (MW), to be commissioned by 2030. Given 
the limitation of the interconnected grid, however, the study recommends 
limiting capacity to approximately 22 megawatt-peak (MWp) per site.
Mali also forms part of the Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought 
Control in the Sahel (Comité Inter-état de Lutte contre la Sècheresse au Sahel, 
CILSS), which brings together 13 countries within the Sudano-Sahelian zone.3
Under the regional solar programme of Permanent Interstate Committee, 151 
solar water pumping and 33 solar home systems have been installed in Mali.
Mali is a member of the Senegal River Basin Development Organization 
(Organisation pour la Mise en Valeur du Fleuve Sénégal, OMVS) which also 
includes Guinea, Mauritania and Senegal. OMVS facilitates the regional 
management of water resources for electricity production in efforts to increase 
food security and reduce poverty, among other objectives, in alignment 
with the policies of its member countries. The OMVS has systematically 
implemented the principle of equitable sharing of economic resources in the 
Senegal River Basin among member states, including ownership of basin 
infrastructure and the benefits of water resources.

Within the OMVS, Mali participate in the construction 
and development of the Manantali and Félou 
hydropower plants, completed in 2001 and 2013, 
respectively. The Manantali hydropower plant has the 
potential to produce 800 gigawatt hours (GWh) a year 
and more than 1 500 kilometres (km) of 225 kilovolt 
(kV) transmission lines, a key achievement in the 
energy field.
EDM S.A. is a member of the West African Power Pool 
(WAPP) (see Figure 3), a specialised ECOWAS institution 
established in 1999 with the aim of harmonising national 
electricity systems within the region and delivering 
power in a stable, reliable and cost-competitive manner. 
The rehabilitation of the 60 MW Félou hydropower 
plant to provide power to Senegal, Mali and Mauritania 
is one of various projects supported by WAPP.
Cross-border interconnection between Mali and Senegal 
enables the transmission of power from the Manantali 
hydro power plant, a multinational concern. In addition 
to completion of the 225 kV line between Mali and 
Côte d’Ivoire in 2012, further interconnections, such as 
Mail-Guinea, are planned in order to limit supressed 
demand as well as reduce the average production cost 
of electricity. Given the region’s hydropower potential, 
the share of renewables (mainly hydro, irrespective of 
size) in the energy mix could increase.
In order to support the creation of a regional power 
market in collaboration with the ECOWAS Regional 
Electricity Regulatory Authority; ECOWAS Centre for 
Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (ECREEE); 
and WAPPIRENA initiated the West Africa Clean Energy 
in the region, the WACEC promotes the development 
of utility-scale renewable power and its integration into 
West African power systems.
Energy Ministers at the Specialised Technical Committee 
on Transport, Transcontinental and Interregional 
Infrastructure, Energy and Tourism of the African 
Union recommended, in April 2019, that the Member 
States, Regional and Continental bodies to integrate 
the concept of the Clean Energy Corridors into their 
renewable energy and climate change agendas as well 
as in the design, implementation and update of regional 
and continental initiatives and programmes to support 
the Continent’s transition to more sustainable, reliable 
and affordable energy systems.
Mali has established beneficial relationships with 
ECREEE, and in June 2016 AER-Mali, in partnership 
with ECREEE, provided capacity building to smalland medium-size enterprises and non-governmental 
organisations to enable them to produce and 
disseminate solutions for clean cooking relating to 
stoves and fuels. The effort encompassed all aspects 
of the clean-cooking value chain. With regard to 
rural electrification, ECREEE has supported Mali in 
undertaking pre-feasibility studies in 97 villages. 
In addition, ECREEE supported the Government of 
Mali in 2015 to develop a BOOT model tender for the 
development of grid-connected renewable energy 
projects.
Mali is a member of the ECOWAS Regional Electricity 
Regulatory Authority. This entity regulates the crossborder exchange of electricity and supports the national 2.2. Energy supply and demand
 in Mali
As in most sub-Saharan African countries, biomass 
(mainly in the form of firewood) provides the bulk of 
the energy supply (Figure 4). Mali has neither proven 
hydrocarbon resources nor a refinery; as a result, all 
petroleum products are imported through neighbouring 
coastal countries which impacts on the country’s 
balance of payments.
Mali, as a landlocked country bordered by 7 countries, 
has to incur high transportation costs. Energy demand 
has been growing faster than its GDP and, if not 
reversed, the trend will result in a major constraint to 
energy supply and economic development.
Mali’s total primary energy supply in 2014 reached 
5.1 million tonnes oil equivalent (Mtoe) out of which 
3.6 Mtoe (69%) is from firewood and 7% from 
charcoal.4
 The share of other biomass is limited to 
residues (<0.5 %), mainly from agriculture and forestry. 
Petroleum products accounted for 1.02 Mtoe (20%) 
mainly gasoline and diesel for the transport sector. The 
share of electricity, including imports, is only 3.8% of 
total energy supply. 
Analyses of the total primary energy supply indicate 
dependence, to a large extent, on non-sustainable 
natural forests, imported petroleum products and, to a 
lesser extent, electricity imports from Côte d’Ivoire. With 
regard to energy consumption, the residential sector 
(72.5%) and the transport sector (13.5%) accounted for 
86% of total demand in 2014 (Figure 2).
Total energy consumption by the residential sector 
is shown in Figure 5. Analyses of total household 
consumption evidence heavy reliance on biomass, 
primarily firewood (84%), a low contribution of charcoal 
(14%) and a significantly low contribution of electricity 
and modern fuels (e.g. liquid petroleum gas (LPG)). Use 
of traditional biomass leads to negative environmental 
and health impacts. Environmental issues that affect 
Mali, due to unsustainable harvesting of firewood, 
include desertification and deforestation. 
Women and children, given that they are mainly 
involved in household chores, have a greater likelihood 
of suffering from infections caused by wood smoke. 
Mali, nevertheless, is one of the few countries that 
have deployed wood energy rural markets to limit the 
impact of deforestation and increase rural incomes. In 
the transport sector, diesel and gasoline account for the 
bulk of consumption.

alleviate poverty, and it is a major input to increasing 
economic productivity. Access in Mali is one of the 
lowest in the world, with sharp disparities across urban 
and rural areas and regions (Figure 6).
In 2015, the nationwide electricity access rate was 41% 
(IEA, 2017), fourfold higher than in 2001. In Bamako, it 
was approximately 85%, although it remained below 
50% in the regions of Kayes and Timbuktu, where this 
figure lies at 25% and 13%, respectively. Low access to 
electricity in regions not yet connected to the national 
grid offers positive opportunities for the large-scale 
deployment of renewables.
In terms of modern fuels for cooking, access is 
extremely low at only 2% and 3% in rural and urban 
areas, respectively, the key reasons being poverty, the 
relatively low price of biomass and the high price of 
LPG. This pattern of consumption is a major threat to 
the sustainability of biomass resources.
Furthermore, this sector is characterised by 
inefficiencies along the entire supply chain (i.e. 
production, transformation, transport, consumption) 
which increase the unsustainable exploitation of natural 
forest resources.
LPG consumption per capita in West Africa is among 
the lowest in the world, and consumption in absolute 
values has not significantly increased since 2009. This 
translates into a diminishing trend of consumption per 
capita during this period, given demographic growth.

 transmission and distribution
From 1960 to 1999, the state-owned electricity utility, 
EDM S.A., had a de jure monopoly on the generation, 
transmission and distribution of electricity. EDM’s 
capital was shared by the Malian State (nearly 98%) and 
France’s utility, Électricité de France (nearly 2%). 
From 1998 to 2000, the GoM undertook a major 
reform of the electricity sub-sector in a key effort to 
remedy the persistent under-performance of the subsector. In 2000, EDM was partially privatised to form a 
consortium that included France’s SAUR (a subsidiary 
of Bouygues S.A.) (47%) and Industrial Promotion 
Services (a subsidiary of the Aga Khan Fund for 
Economic Development) (13%). The hydropower plants, 
however, were kept under state ownership. In 2005, 
SAUR sold its shares in EDM to other parties, and the 
state regained 66% control (AfDB, 2015). The remaining 
shares were owned by Industrial Promotion Services 
West Africa. In July 2018, the state regained full control 
of the utility.
Mali’s power system encompasses an interconnected 
grid that is owned by EDM, supplying 35 towns including 
Bamako. EDM S.A. also manages 31 isolated production 
centres that are powered with diesel generators and 
two centres supplied by Côte d’Ivoire’s medium-voltage 
grid.5
 EDM is responsible for cross-border electricity 
trade (export and import) as well as power purchases 
from independent producers.
The Malian Agency for Domestic Energy and Rural 
Electrification (Agence Malienne pour l’Energie 
Domestique et l’Electrification Rurale, AMADER) 
oversees the rural electrification of schemes below 
250 kilowatts and acts as de facto regulator for rural 
electrification (Figure 7).
Electricity generation
Hydropower and thermal6
 power stations are the 
main power generation plants. Despite the presence of 
various hybrid systems (e.g. solar and diesel), the share 
of renewables excluding large hydropower remains low.

grid but which are still managed by the national power utility, EDM.

Notes : SOGEM = Société de Gestion de l’Energie de Manantali; IDB = Islamic Development Bank; and IPP = Independent Power Producer.Mali benefits from a 30 MW minimum guaranteed 
capacity from Côte d’Ivoire which has been raised to 
50 MW based on an agreement (EDM, 2017). In 2017, 
imports from Côte d’Ivoire reached 333.18 GWh; that is, 
16% in excess of total electricity generated to supply the 
national grid. With regard to the isolated centres, total 
installed capacity stood at only 70 MW in 2015, a drop 
from 75 MW in 2014 due to the decommissioning of 
various diesel power plants. The electricity of isolated 
centres comes from small generators (0.74-14.5 MW), 
accounting for approximately 7.6% of EDM’s total 
generation.
Access by the rural population to electricity remains 
extremely low. In 2015, only an estimated 16.7% had 
access to power, including street lighting (PANER, 
2015). The share of renewables and hybrid systems is 
estimated at 4.3%. Decentralised renewable or hybrid 
solutions may offer the least cost option for rural 
electrification. 
The World Bank, through AMADER, has initiated the 
Rural Electrification Hybrid System Project to expand 
access to modern energy services in rural areas. This 
project aims to increase renewable-based generation 
capacity in existing rural power stations that supply 
rural mini-grids and to expand those with approximately 
4.8 MWp of capacity through hybrid systems, including 
PV panels, inverters, batteries and control electronics, 
as well as mini-grid extension and densification (World 
Bank, 2017c).
Given the limits of the interconnected grid, the 
isolated centres and many enterprises, mainly in the 
mining sector, generate their own electricity. Diesel is 
the principal fuel for electricity self-generation. The 
production cost of diesel generators is particularly 
high, which may offer opportunities for decentralised 
renewables. Approximately 56 GWh was generated in 
2014 by self-producers, from which 4.5 GWh was from 
waste and or agricultural residues (SIE, 2014).
The electricity generation mix, which consists of a 
large share of thermal power (see Figure 8), is pushing 
production costs upwards due to fuel price fluctuations, 
while hydro power is impacted by climate change. Other 
renewable energy sources for electricity generation 
are limited to small PV systems, although major gridconnected PV power plants are under construction in 
the Kita District (Box 1).

de Manantali – SOGEM) from the Manantali hydropower 
plant that also connects Bamako with the towns of 
Kayes and Kita). A second 225 kV line from the town 
of Ferkessédougou, as part of the interconnection with 
Côte d›Ivoire, has extended Mali›s grid to the towns of 
Koutiala and Sikasso by connecting them to the 150 kV 
Bamako-Fana-Ségou line in Ségou (See Figure 9).
Total technical and non-technical losses in the electricity 
sector remain high. They stood at approximately 20% 
over the 2010-14 period (DNE, 2016).

costs and low voltage and medium voltage tariffs 
(USD/kWh)

Note: KWh = kilowatt hour.
2.4. Renewable energy potential 
 and use
Biomass
Biomass derives from forest resources and agricultural 
residues, among others. In terms of the former, Mali’s 
ecological diversity includes forest situations that 
vary from shrub savannahs in the north; the tiger 
bush that covers 25% of the South; and the forests 
of the Sudan-Guinean zone in the west. The national 
forest area is estimated at 100 million hectares (ha), 
from which approximately 32 million ha comprise the 
bulk of woody resources. The area under controlled 
exploitation is in excess of 350 000 ha. Forest areas and 
their productivity are in perpetual decline, mainly as a 
result of wood fuel consumption, pastoralism and forest 
clearance for agriculture (SIE, 2014).
According to Mali Forest Information and Data, the 
exploitation of wood fuel and charcoal, the main sources 
of household energy, is estimated at 5 million tonnes 
a year (i.e. exploitation of 400 000 ha). These figures 
are expected to exceed 7 million tonnes, or 560 000 ha, 
in the near future. The main challenge is to ensure the 
sustainable use of this resource which should include 
partial fuel switching to modern energy sources to keep 
pace with the productivity of natural forests.
With regard to agricultural residues, IRENA’s database 
provide figures for these in terms of capacity and 
electricity generation potential throughout the country 
(See Table 4). These are based on energy conversion, 
capacity factor and harvest growth assumptions until 
2050.
Tariffs
Further to the penetration of pre-paid meters, EDM has 
two broad categories of tariffs, pre-paid and post-paid. 
Tariffs depend on several parameters (e.g. consumption, 
voltage and subscribed power) for each category. 
Table 3, below, gives an overview of the EDM’s electricity 
tariff.
In 2014 and 2015, average production costs per kWh 
reached USD 0.23 and USD 0.20, respectively, which 
is significantly high (See Figure 10). Average selling 
prices also are excessive, although they remain far 
below average production costs for low, medium and 
high voltage. The fuel used for the generation of power 
and end-user tariffs alike are subsidised by the GoM. 
In 2015, the total subsidy received by EDM amounted 
to USD 106.7 million in 2014; 2014, USD 78.5 million in 
2015 and USD 62.9 million in 2016. High tariffs offer 
opportunities for renewables and explain, to a large 
extent, the development of solar PV projects. 
Table 4. Potential capacity and electricity generation from Mali’s agricultural residues, 2010-50
Based on IRENA estimatesBiofuels
In Mali, biofuels encompass bio-ethanol from the 
sugarcane industry as well as jatropha oil. Deployment 
targets for both products are highlighted in Table 5.
Expectations from biofuels, particularly with regard to 
jatropha are being called into question at the national 
level for a series of reasons, notably their vulnerability 
to market externalities as well as low yields which have 
compromised the cost effectiveness of the entire value 
chain. Furthermore, the overall reduction in oil price 
levels since 2013 has affected the competitiveness of 
biofuels as an alternative.

Hydropower
Hydropower currently accounts for a significant share 
of installed capacity and electricity generation. There 
remains, however, considerable untapped potential, 
some of which require further assessment while others 
are in the process of being developed. Hydroelectric 
potential capacity is estimated at 1 050 MW, with an 
annual average energy generation of approximately 
5 000 GWh. The following table summarises the status 
of Mali’s hydro power potential.
Considerable 
hydropower potential 
remains untappedSolar power
The values in Figure 11 indicate that there is substantial 
variation between north and south due to the seasonal 
differences in cloud cover and the position of the sun. 
In the south, however, where most activities and the 
population are located, average solar radiation data 
collected over a long period shows that the average 
solar daily radiation is above 5.5 kWh/square metre/
day, which is sufficient to deploy solar applications that 
are cost effective.
IRENA has carried out a comprehensive study on the 
prospects for renewables in West Africa (IRENA, 2018b) 
to assess the energy potential. Beyond maps, the 
findings of the study highlight the future capacity and/
or production of Mali’s renewables.
Solar energy is disaggregated according to key 
technologies; that is, concentrated solar power and PV, 
whereby the former reflects 36.2 terawatt hours and 
the latter, 79.1 terawatt hours.
As expected, solar energy – particularly solar PV – has 
the most significant potential. According to the most 
reliable data (AER-Mali and National Energy Directorate 
(Direction Nationale de l’Energie, DNE), total installed 
capacity in 2014 did not exceed 17 MW. This scenario, 
however, could dramatically change based on the 
global trend in the generation of solar PV.

Wind power
Wind energy resources, particularly in the south, are 
not as promising as solar (See Figure 12). Wind speeds 
of 5 metres/second are generally considered to be the 
lower limit for the economically feasible exploitation of 
wind resources.
Wind speeds greater than 5 metres/second prevail in 
the northern part of the country at above 16 degrees’ 
latitude, including in the towns of Timbuktu and Gao. 
Due to the low population density in those areas, 
however, demand will be low. Moreover, the critical 
political and security situation affecting the north of 
Mali will be a determining factor in the development of 
wind projects.
2.5. Energy sector and climate change
Mali has committed to address climate change by 
having become, in 1994, a signatory to the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and, 
in 1999, the Kyoto Protocol. Mali’s total greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions, expressed in CO2
eq, remain rather 
low, amounting to 0.06% share of world total emissions 
(GoM, 2015). Within the framework of the three national 
communications of Mali on climate change (GoM, 
2000; MEA, 2011; GoM, 2015), detailed calculations 
for GHG emissions were carried out according to the 
thdlf thIttl Pl 
These three communications, together with Mali’s 
Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) (GoM, 2016), 
establish that energy is the sector with the highest GHG 
emissions and increasing. Over the 2007-14 period, 
emissions from energy production and consumption 
have increased from 3.43 million tonnes CO2
eq to 
5.26 million tonnes CO2
eq, averaging a 6.4% annual 
increase (Figure 13).

t CO2eqOver the 2007-14 period, GHG emissions have risen 
sharply, mainly as a result of the increase in energy 
consumption. GHG emissions per capita, however, 
remain relatively low compared with many other African 
countries. Owing to its forest cover, Mali is a key net 
carbon sink and as such, the sustainable development 
of forest resources is vital for the nation to maintain its 
positive contribution in carbon sequestration.
 
With regard to energy sources, biomass accounts for the 
bulk of Mali’s total primary energy supply. Furthermore, 
this sub-sector is characterised by significantly low 
efficiency for energy transformation (wood to charcoal) 
and use. As a result, the residential sector - and main 
consumer of biomass - is responsible for over 82.2% 
of GHG emissions in the energy sector. Emissions 
from energy industries, particularly the power sector, 
account for less than 5% (Figure 14). Managing the 
future carbon footprint of the energy sector with a 
higher penetration of renewables in the electricity mix 
and the sustainable use of biomass would limit the 
increase of GHG emissions in Mali.
In terms of power generation, Mali still relies heavily on 
hydropower due to its substantial potential,8
 already 
partially tapped. To cope with increasing electricity 
demand, feasibility studies have been undertaken to 
further utilise hydro potential. As shown in Table 6, 
a total of 218 MW of generation capacity is currently 
being developed, while 342-412 MW is at the prefeasibility stage. This cumulative generation will add up 
to 2 504 GWh to the country’s electricity generation, 
thereby meeting over two-thirds of incremental 
electricity demand, estimated to grow by 3 777 GWh 
between 2017 and 2030 (IRENA, 2018b).
This strong focus on hydropower, nevertheless, fails to 
take into consideration key features and factors that 
have an impact on the development of this source of 
energy, such as the hydrological trends in the Niger 
Basin which continue to impact the performance 
of the hydropower installations it hosts. Historical 
data collected in Koulikoro (Upper Niger)9
 and in 
the upstream basins shows a high inter-annual flow 
variability that has occurred since 1907, as well as a 
strong decrease since 1970. In addition, this trend is 
coupled with a decrease in the groundwater level of 
tributary rivers, resulting in a runoff deficit (Mahé et al., 
2011).
The Niger Basin is located in a region that is prone to 
droughts at four to six-year intervals, as evidenced 
from the close correlation between the Standardized 
Precipitation Index (SPI),10 Standardized Precipitated 
and Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)11 and Standardized 
Runoff Index12 shown in Figure 15. These indices track 
the evolution between 1961 and 2012.
8 Mali is home to two river basins, the Niger River and the 
Senegal River. For this study, however, only data from the Niger 
River has been largely considered, since it crosses the country 
from west to east for a length of 1 700 km. Information has 
been more readily available from the Niger Basin Authority.
9 The Niger River Basin comprises four distinct sections; these 
are the Upper Niger, Inner Delta, Middle Niger and Lower Niger.
10 SPI is an index characterising meteorological drought on 
a range of timescales. On a short timescale, the SPI closely 
relates to soil moisture, while at longer timescales, it relates to 
groundwater and reservoir storage.
11 The SPEI is an extension of the SPI, taking into account 
precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (a combination 
of evaporation and crop transpiration) in determining drought. 
Thus, unlike the SPI, the SPEI captures the main impact of 
increased temperatures on water demand.
12 The SRI is a hydrological drought indicator, based on an 
assessment of the runoff (or streamflow) of a given basin, 
usually spreading over a specific period of time.

Moreover, the level of rainfall (SPI) is projected to 
decrease until at least the year 2100. For example, the 
region of Sikasso, the region receiving most rainfall 
in the country, will experience a reduction in average 
rainfall per annum from 1 000 millimetres in the 1960-90 
period to 850 millimetres in 2100 (DNM, 2007).
2.6. Drivers for renewable energy 
 deployment
In light of the energy context described in previous 
chapters, many drivers exist to stimulate actors 
to support the deployment of renewable energy 
technologies in Mali. Aspects such as improved access 
to modern energy services, improved energy supply 
reliability, climate change mitigation and adaptation 
and the creation of local economic value and jobs 
are few examples. In fact, Sustainable Development 
Goal 7 which aims to “Ensure access to affordable, 
reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all”, has 
proved to have strong linkages with other SDGs; and 
“increasing substantially the share of renewable energy 
in the global energy mix by 2030” also is one of its 
targets. Mali’s National Renewable Energy and Energy 
Efficiency Action Plan highlights the country’s ambition 
to decrease its reliance on fossil fuels and to put the 
country on a low-carbon development pathway.
Improved access to modern energy services
In Mali, less than half of the population has access to 
electricity, whereas in rural areas access is limited to 
only 16.7% of the population. In terms of modern fuels, 
access is extremely low, at only 2% and 3% for rural 
and urban areas, respectively. Energy access is widely 
recognised as essential to improve economic welfare. 
Access to reliable, cost-effective and environmentally 
sustainable energy through renewable energy 
technologies can have a multiplier effect on 
development, such as reduced health effects, improved 
livelihoods, poverty alleviation, job creation, gender 
equality and enhanced access to water and food. These 
crosscutting impacts of renewables are also at the heart 
of efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. 
Renewable energy has proven its case in providing 
reliable and sustainable access to power to over 146 
million people through off-grid systems by 2016.
Electricity supply diversification and reliability
At present, thermal and large-scale hydropower 
plants are the main sources of electricity supply on 
the national grid. Renewable energy could provide the 
most competitive form of power in Mali due to today’s 
advanced technological reliability, declining technology 
costs and high resource potential. As explained 
earlier, the strong level of climate vulnerability of 
Mali’s hydropower-based power supply system also 
emphasises the need for diversification in the power 
supply. As shown in Box 2, with the examples of 
Brazil and Colombia, non-hydro renewables can play a 
strong role in adapting to climate-induced hydrologic 
fluctuations that affect power systems that comprise a 
large share of installed hydropower capacity.
Socio-economic value creation
With 11 million jobs created worldwide so far, renewable 
energy is a catalyser for new employment opportunities. 
This is especially true in a country traditionally 
dominated by conventional sources of energy supply. It 
provides new avenues for technological innovation and 
the opening of new sectors for economic value creation.
Low-carbon development
The combustion of fossil fuels and traditional use 
of bioenergy is a major source of local air pollution, 
with sulphur dioxide, nitric oxide and microparticles 
as some of the main pollutants. These pollutants can 
cause adverse human health effects, although they 
also can reduce agricultural yields, devastate forests 
and fisheries (acid rain) and damage buildings and 
infrastructure. The majority of adverse impacts, however, 
are evident on human health. Renewables also offer the 
most prominent low-carbon solution to meeting Mali’s 
climate targets. The country has committed to reducing 
its GHG emissions by 35% by 2030 compared to the 
1990 base year in the NDC under the Paris Agreement. 
The NDC already emphasises use of alternative and 
renewable energy sources to achieve this target.

SPIBox 2: Diversification towards non-hydro renewables 
 for climate change adaption in the power sector: 
 Brazil and Colombia
South American countries with high shares of 
hydropower in their electricity mix have been dealing 
with the concept of diversification of primary energy 
sources in recent years. The examples of Brazil and 
Colombia, where hydropower has accounted in each for 
over two-thirds* of total grid-connected installed power 
generation capacity in 2018, illustrate how non-hydro 
renewables contribute to electricity supply security and 
affordability in light of changing hydrologic behaviour.
Among the four interconnected subsystems in which 
the Brazilian power system is divided, the northeast 
best illustrates the role of diversification towards nonhydro renewables in the context of changing hydrologic 
behaviour. The figure below indicates the decreasing 
trend in water inflows to the hydropower plants of the 
northeastern sub-system since late 2012. Although 
scientific discussions continues in Brazil on whether 
or not these decrements can be traced to climate 
change or to long-term climatic cycles, one thing is 
certain: the increase in wind power production (and, 
more recently, solar power output) in the northeast has 
contributed decisively to the local balance between 
load and generation. In its absence, production costs 
and emissions associated with local thermal generation 
would have risen further.
Other complementarity mechanisms between 
hydropower and renewables are also essential to Brazil’s 
northeast sub-system. The above scenario clearly 
depicts the partial seasonal complementarity between 
wind power output and water inflow to reservoirs in 
the region, with average monthly wind power output 
peaking in September and October – not among the 
most humid months.
While not visible in the graph, the flexible output of 
hydropower also plays a role in counteracting the shortterm variability of wind and solar power resources in 
the northeast. Local resources and imports from Brazil’s 
southeastern system account for the largest share of 
installed hydropower capacity in the country.
In Colombia, the matter of diversification of primary 
resources for electricity generation as an adaptation 
strategy against climate change has caught the 
attention of governmental institutions, at least 
since 2013. Colombia’s Energy Mining Planning Unit 
(Unidad de Planeación Minero Energética, UPME), the 
governmental executing agency for planning studies 
relating to the energy sector, issued its first assessment 
on the subject that same year. Other adaptation 
measures assessed in the study target demand-side 
management and the conservation of river basins.
Colombia has come a long way since the first studies 
were published. In the following year, in 2014, the 
government issued Law #1715 establishing guidelines for 
the deployment of renewable energy in the Colombian 
power system. This legal instrument explicitly points 
to diversification of energy supply as one of the 
diversification drivers towards other renewable energy 
sources. The process culminated in March 2018 with 
the issuance of Decree #570/2018 by the Ministry of 
Mines and Energy (Ministerio de Minas y Energía, MME). 
This decree, de facto, establishes auctions aimed at 
contracting wind and solar power projects in Colombia, 
while listing the “resiliency of the electricity generation 
matrix to climate change and climate variability” as one 
of the reasons for doing so.

 frameworks
Mali’s National Energy Policy (NEP) dates back to 
2006 and aims to contribute to its overall sustainable 
development through the provision of cheap and 
reliable energy services, in order to increase electricity 
access and to promote its underlying socio-economic 
benefits. Centred around the guiding principles of 
decentralisation, liberalisation, competitiveness and 
public-private partnerships, its key objectives are 
(i) to meet energy needs at the most adequate quality, 
quantity and cost; (ii) to ensure protection against the 
risks of inadequate energy services; (iii) to strengthen 
the capacities of the relevant stakeholders of the energy 
sector at the levels of policy, operations and monitoring; 
and (iv) to strengthen international co-operation in the 
energy sector. Table 8 gives an overview of renewable 
energy objectives and measures contained in the NEP.
The NEP was supplemented in 2009 by the National 
Energy Sector Policy Letter, which specified further 
the objectives of the policy, notably through measures 
such as restructure of the national power utility and 
tariff reforms; development of additional hydropower 
and thermal capacity; and reinforcement of the power 
system’s overall infrastructure with, in particular, the 
strengthening of interconnections with neighbouring 
countries,
At the sub-sector level, a National Strategy for the 
Development of Renewable Energies (2006) and a 
National Strategy for the Development of Biofuels 
(2008) have been formulated. These embody the strong 
political will to develop indigenous energy sources. 
The NEP and the previously mentioned national 
energy sector strategies in Mali are being updated to 
incorporate any specific innovative approaches that 
support the rapid development of the sector.
Table 8: Mali’s National Energy Policy: Renewable energy objectives and measures

With regard to Mali’s regulatory framework, the
electricity sector is governed by Order No. 00-019/P-RM 
of 15 March 2000 and its amended Implementing Decree 
No. 00-184 /P-RM of 14 April 2000, which liberalises the 
power sector. It also defines the following guidelines, 
among others:
• general pricing; 
• tendering processes;
• procedures for terminating concessions and 
• authorisations of permit holders;
• definition of technical and financial management 
• ratios; and
• grid connection fees.
The tendering process guidelines, described in 
the abovementioned order, were reinforced by 
Law No. 2011-084 of 29 December 2011. Furthermore, 
Decree No. 2014-0816/PRM of 27 October 2014 
suspending the import levy of VAT, fees and taxes 
on solar equipment and renewable energy, comes to 
an end and should be subject to extension for a new 
five-year period.
The Authority of ECOWAS Heads of State and 
Government, in July 2013, expressed its commitment 
to provide access to sustainable energy services in 
West Africa by adopting a ground-breaking policy, the 
ECOWAS Renewable Energy Policy. This policy aims to 
increase the share of renewable energy in the region’s 
overall electricity generation mix to 23% by 2020 and 
31% by 2030 (ECREEE, 2013).
This was later translated into the National Renewable 
Energy Action Plan (NREAP) for the 15 member 
states. The objectives of the NREAPs fed later into the 
formulation of Sustainability for All (SEforALL) Action 
Agendas. In Mali’s case, the NREAP was developed in 
2015, building on the NEP’s guiding principles. This 
action plan (GoM and ECOWAS, 2015) details the 
targets and measures for grid and off-grid renewable 
energy, as well as efficient cookstoves. Milestones are 
set for 2020 and 2030, beginning from a 2010 baseline. 
Table 9 summarises the NREAP’s key targets for gridconnected renewables.
In Mali, a decline is expected in the relative value of 
the share of renewables in the electricity mix due to 
an increase of electricity imports (generated from 
non-renewable sources) from the regional market 
(Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea and Nigeria). For nongrid connected renewables, systems are broken down 
into mini-grids, including hybrid and other systems, as 
summarised in Table 10.

Financing the renewable energy sector is a key 
challenge in most sub-Saharan African countries as, 
while the initial investment may be high, operating 
costs are low. In least-developed countries such as Mali, 
the public sector often lacks sufficient financial means 
to invest in energy generation.
To attract investment mainly from outside the country, 
Mali has adopted an investment code in 2012,13 which 
provides a number of benefits to private investors 
to develop the electricity sector, such as the waiving 
of minimum investment threshold requirements. 
Investment authorisation requests for approval are 
now processed through a single online database that 
processes the documents within five days. In addition, 
further incentives are granted, as follows:
• Non-discrimination: Foreign investors will benefit 
from the same rights and privileges as do local 
investors.
• Repatriation of funds: Repatriation of the entire 
capital and profits by individuals and companies.
• Foreign property: Foreign companies are able to 
maintain the entire capital 
• Dispute resolution: Mali is a member of the 
International Centre for Settlement of Investment 
Disputes Investments, the Common Court 
for Justice and Arbitration (CCJA), and the 
Organisation for the Harmonization of Corporate 
Law in Africa (OHADA)
• Investment guarantee: Investments are guaranteed 
by Article 15 of the treaty that establishes the 
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency.
In addition, investors will be able to benefit from 
reduced customs tax, value added tax, and taxes that 
relate to investments above USD 500 000 (Table 11).
Although Mali is overall ranked at the 145th place 
in 2019 (143 in 2016) in the Ease of Doing Business 
report, a significant progress was achieved to register a 
company. For this indicator, Mali is ranked at the 110th 
place in 2019 compared to 172th in 2016 (World Bank, 
2017b). To register a company, the applicants submit 
all documents and forms at the API’s one-stop shop. It 
takes only five days to complete the procedure. Since 
March 2015, the database regularly publishes a notice 
of incorporation of new companies on its website. The 
cost of the publication is included in the notary fee. In 
terms of renewables, the agency publishes investment 
data that relates to energy service companies tapping 
into Mali’s energy potential.
Budget allocation and investment in the renewable 
energy sector, nevertheless, remains low compared 
with the country’s needs and potential. The budget 
allocated by the Government of Mali (GoM) to the 
renewable energy sub-sector rose from USD 6.7 million 
in 201014 to USD 21.2 million in 2018. This is projected to 
rise further to approximately USD 70 million by 2020 
(MEF, 2018). Despite the increase, the budget remains 
modest especially when considering that it takes into 
account the staff wages of those public institutions 
involved in renewable energy.

Most projects that previously were undertaken have 
been financed by various donors such as multilateral and bilateral development and co-operation 
organisations (e.g. African Development Bank, European 
Union, United Nations Development Programme and 
World Bank), as well as national and international nongovernment organisations (e.g. Mali Folkecenter, SNV 
Netherlands). By and large, the financial and technical 
support that is provided by each organisation has 
targeted specific areas (Table 12). 
Apart from the technical and financial support provided 
by the bilateral and multilateral organisations, the GoM 
has set up mechanisms and incentives to speed up the 
deployment of renewables. A key incentive has been 
issuance of Decree No. 2014-0816/P-RM of 27 October 
2014 that suspends, for five years, until 2019, value 
added tax on renewable energy equipment imports.
With regard to rural electrification, a major incentive 
aside from the support from AMADER is Mali’s Rural 
Electrification Fund (REF) that was created in 2000 
under Decree 00-019/P-RM.
The fund aims to promote the country’s rural 
electrification agenda through various pilot projects, 
communication and awareness-raising campaigns. More 
specifically, it provides financial support, among others, 
for feasibility studies, subsidies to upfront investment 
costs, and guarantees for rural electrification schemes.
Resources of the Rural Electrification Fund are provided 
by grants from development partners, donors, loans 
and from the renewal of grant authorisations from 
AMADER. In terms of mechanisms, AMADER only 
allocates investment subsidies and, as far as possible, 
complies with the principles of competition relating to 
grant awards. Projects below 50 kW, however, are not 
subject to competition, given their small size.
On the basis of the BOOT (build, own, operate and 
transfer) schemes and the procurement activities 
already under way, an additional PV capacity of 
158 MW could be added in the short- to mid-term for 
an approximate investment of USD 182 million. Apart 
from solar PV, three BOOT schemes have been signed 
to deploy 61 MW of hydropower capacity on three sites 
for a total investment of USD 210 million. Although solar PV projects are at various stages 
of development, a sharp discrepancy in cost per 
installed megawatt has occurred between projects 
(e.g. USD 1.6m/MW in the case of Scatec Solar 
and USD 2.1m/MW for Akuo Energy). For ongoing 
procurement activities, however, investment per 
installed capacity is much lower and is in line with 
international downward price trends. With regard to 
Scatec Solar, it is not a new entrant into Mali. Scatec 
prepared an initial feasibility study in May 2011 for a 
10 MWp PV power plant in Mopti. 
The construction of Mali’s utility-scale projects has 
yet to begin, despite the fact no licences were issued 
and power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed for 
several years. A major challenge lies in the provision 
of credit guarantees, the shortage of which has, to a 
large extent, limited the funding of renewables projects 
in sub-Saharan Africa to large bilateral and multilateral 
financial institutions.
This is because foreign private actors primarily rely on 
their own funds and those of their financial partners to 
secure investment capital.
Banks are reluctant to provide loans to independent 
power producers (IPP) for fear they will not be serviced 
according to schedule if IPPs are no longer paid on time 
for the power they deliver. To overcome the financial 
constraint, lenders usually require a letter of credit to 
back payment obligations under a PPA to complement 
the host government’s guarantees.
In most cases, however, the bank that provides the 
letter of credit will request up to 100% cash as collateral, 
usually provided by the utility. Most IPP projects are still 
pending since this liquidity requirement cannot be met 
by the utilities, given their financial situation. Innovative 
financing mechanisms must therefore be designed to 
speed up the implementation of mature renewable 
energy projects (Table 13).

Initiated by Germany’s KfW Development Bank, 
implemented by the African Trade Insurance Agency 
(ATI) and funded by the German Ministry for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (Bundesministerium 
für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung, 
BMZ), the Regional Liquidity Support Facility (RLSF) 
enables a sustainable financing approach by providing 
utilities and commercial banks the collateral they 
require for power purchase agreements.
The facility’s shareholders are 13 African member 
countries plus the African Development Bank. ATI is 
a multilateral insurer of trade credit and political risk 
investment (ATI, 2016). ATI issues a letter of credit 
to select banks for the IPPs that have been approved 
and backed by the facility. ATI also assesses each 
transaction to ensure that the project is fully supported 
by the utility and host government. The relevant 
mechanisms are illustrated in the figure below.
The bank that issues the letter of credit is protected 
by the cash component that serves as a first-loss 
buffer. The second loss guarantee is provided 
by ATI and matches the component. When 
an independent power producer experiences 
payment delays, it can draw immediately from the 
letter of credit, thus enabling it to continue its debt 
repayment to its lenders.
Eligible projects must comply with the following 
criteria:
• Installed capacity up to 50 megawatts
 (up to 100 megawatts in exceptional cases).
• Supported technologies that include solar 
photovoltaic, hydro, onshore wind, geothermal, 
biomass (i.e. waste-to-energy), co-generation
 (i.e. renewable feedstock).
• Sufficient support of the host government and 
utility.

 ISSUES AFFECTING 
 RENEWABLE ENERGY
DEPLOYMENT 
Development of the renewable energy market is largely subject to Mali’s natural 
resource assets and corresponding technologies to convert energy sources into 
services, as well as its regulatory environment in relation to the private sector. 
This chapter not only identifies the challenges and opportunities faced by 
Mali’s renewable energy sector; it also covers the various resources, policy and 
regulatory frameworks, private sector involvement, and human capacities and 
skills necessary to develop current renewable energy technologies. The status of 
each subsector is reviewed, followed by the issues that need confronting.
The key issues are based on an initial analysis that follows the drafting of a 
background paper. They also arose from the exchange of information at the 
initial meeting on IRENA’s Renewable Readiness Assessment (RRA) and from 
various bilateral meetings held in Mali with key local stakeholders.
4.1. On-grid renewables
Reliable, sustainable and affordable electricity is a prerequisite for 
transformative development. The grid remains essential to reach large 
numbers of people in a cost-effective way. To extend the national power grid 
is, by far, the most effective method to provide communities with power. 
Moreover, Mali’s geographical location offers significant opportunities to 
enable it to play a key role in developing a regional power market.
The RRA process identified hydro, solar and biomass as the key sources 
for grid-connected power. There remain, however, fundamental issues that 
should be examined in terms of developing large-scale hydropower, such as 
the variability of the water regime in the river basins, as well as the effects of 
climate change. These can be addressed by deploying non-hydro renewable 
energy and overcoming the technical, institutional, resource and financial 
barriers that prevent the establishment of a stable and resilient power 
infrastructure.
Diversify power supply through increased penetration
of non-hydropower renewables 
As highlighted earlier, the power produced by Mali’s energy sector accounts 
for a negligible portion of total GHG emissions. Despite this, however, the 
sector is threated by the impact of climate change based on its heavy 
reliance on hydro. This makes it more compelling to prioritise and accelerate 
the deployment of renewable energy resources beyond that of hydropower. 
Mali has identified, in its National Adaptation Programme of Action, the 
vulnerability to climate change of its energy sector. It ranks the sector as the 
third most vulnerable, following agriculture and health (DNM, 2007). Indeed, 
recent history evidences sharp differences in the generation of electricity due 
to variations in the rainfall between the average and dry yearsas illustrated 15 Unlike Sélingué and Sotuba, the Manantali Dam is not located in the Niger River Basin; rather, it lies on the Senegal River. It has been 
added to this analysis because of the similarities of the climate change impacts across the two basins.
16 Average capacity factor of the Ségou solar power plant (AfDB, 2016).
17 Based on own calculation by dividing the difference in output of 118.3 GWh by the product of the average capacity factor and the 
number of hours in a year, which was converted into MW.
18 In these calculations, 1% of the total suitable area up to 30 km from a transmission was assumed to be used for solar power 
generation.
A 1% decrease in water flow results in an estimated 
1.3 million kWh decrease in the generation of 
hydropower (NDE, 2011). At present, the deficit of 
hydropower generation installations is covered by an 
emergency thermal power supply, which have been 
playing an increasingly important role in the country’s 
electricity supply mix, reaching up to 21.59% in 2014 
(EDM, 2018), as shown by Figure 17.
The increasing use of Emergency Power Producers in 
the power mix results in an added financial burden on 
the public sector due to the heavy subsidisation of the 
fossil fuels as well as the end user tariff.
Emergency power producers (EPP) represented 
over 21% of the power generation mix in 2014, a time 
when the subsidy level exceeded USD 106 million. 
This compares with USD 63 million in 2016 when EPPs 
represented roughly 18% of the generation mix (EDM, 
2016; EDM, 2017).
Furthermore, and despite their relatively short lead 
time, EPPs significantly contribute to GHG emissions. 
In light of these challenges in developing and exploiting 
hydropower, as well as the presence of backup options 
that rely only on EPPs, the GoM has to consider 
alternative renewable energy technologies that will 
represent far more sustainable and cost-effective 
options (e.g. solar PV).
At a capacity factor of 18%,16 an estimated 118 MW17 of 
solar generation will be required to compensate for the 
Selingué, Sotuba and Manantali deficit of hydropower 
generation in the dry years. This is evident in light of the 
country’s ever-increasing demand for electricity.
The investment cost of PV systems is rapidly declining. 
Driven by an 81% drop in the price of solar PV modules 
since the end of 2009 and a reduction in system costs, 
the global weighted average levelised cost of electricity 
of utility-scale solar PV has fallen 73% between 2010 
and 2017 (IRENA, 2018a).
These reductions imply that residential and commercial 
grid-connected systems have significantly increased in 
attractiveness and that grid parity (i.e. parity between 
the cost of PV for these two systems and the retail price 
for household electricity) has been achieved - or is 
approaching achievement.
From an assessment undertaken by IRENA of the 
viability of solar as a backup capacity versus dieselbased emergency power generation, it was established 
that the southwestern region of Mali has the most 
suitable zones for solar power in terms of existing 
potential, grid infrastructure and load centres, among 
others. IRENA has calculated that only in that part 
of the country lies the opportunity to install up to 
53 gigawatts of grid-connected solar capacity.18

MWWith regard to costing, IRENA has assessed the 
financial viability19 of 11 solar sites located in the 
southwestern region of Mali, including Sélingué where 
there is a hydropower station.20 The results of the 
Sélingué appraisal indicate that at a capital cost of 13% 
- comparable to prevailing regional market rates - a 
project would be achievable at a cost of approximately 
USD 217.96/MWh with a 90% confidence level in annual 
energy generation. Even if the confidence level were at 
50%, the tariff would drop down to USD 195/MWh.
These cost figures are substantially lower than those of 
EDM’s average generation at USD 280/MWh. They are 
also less than the cost of diesel-powered EPPs in Mali, 
which can be as high as USD 331/MWh.
Promote utility-scale solar photovoltaic
In light of the decline in costs and Mali’s resilience to 
climate change, the government could well consider 
the rapid deployment of solar power. For that to occur, 
however, there are various recommendations offered.
• Conduct a thorough assessment of the current status 
and further development of hydropower resources 
in light of the hydrological projections of and water 
regime changes in the Niger Basin and Senegal Basins, 
its effects on the vulnerable economic sectors such as 
agriculture (food security) and health as well as the 
projections for electricity demand in the medium-tolong; and develop a hydropower development roadmap 
• Develop a power sector master plan that adequately 
captures sustainable and cost-effective renewable 
energy options, in line with the National Renewable 
Energy and Energy Efficiency Action Plans as well as 
the energy components of the 2014-2035 Optimal 
Investments Master Plan
• With the support of international partners such as 
the Green Climate Fund, Global Environment Facility 
and Sustainable Development Mechanism, develop 
and implement a long-term climate change resilience 
strategy that takes into account Mali’s energy sector.
19 IRENA’s site assessment focuses on appraising the financial 
viability of solar and wind projects earmarked for development, 
in order to establish a benchmark fee for a bidding process 
in relation to the various sites. This will help local authorities 
and project developers alike to understand their economic 
rationale and the investment potential and return. The 
assessment is based on inputs from countries, such as the cost 
of capital, grid availability, geographic co-ordinates, income 
tax and installed capacity.

Photograph: ShutterstockUntap the bio-energy potential for power generation
As highlighted in Chapter 2, Section 2.1, Mali has 
significant bio-energy resources that can lead to a 
paradigm shift in the structure of the power supply 
system. A country-wide, in-depth assessment of bioenergy resources and a policy framework are among the 
key initial steps toward better utilisation of resources.
Assess the potential of various bio-energy resources
There has been neither a detailed appraisal of the 
country’s bio-energy potential nor an assessment 
undertaken of the cotton and sugar industries to date. 
Such analyses, including the generation of energy, have 
been conducted only in relation to rice residues by 
Denmark’s DANIDA. Such assessments should include a 
mapping of the various potential sources of bio-energy 
across the country, as well as a robust framework 
to support its use, especially in relation to power 
generation and, in particular, through the cogeneration 
of and waste-to-energy plants.
Develop an overall bio-energy policy that takes into 
account other sectorial strategies
For power generation at a utility scale, an in-depth 
evaluation is required of the processing facilities for 
Mali’s biomass feedstock (i.e. bagasse from sugar 
production and waste, used Mali’s strong cotton 
industry). The example of N’Sukula - a sugar factory 
that applies bagasse to generate power for its own 
consumption as well as for the EDM grid - could be 
scaled up by adopting policies and incentives to the use 
of this resource. 
In summary, an overall policy framework is required 
to support the mid- and long-term strategies of 
the agriculture and industry sectors, with a view to 
streamlining their approach towards modernising 
the use of forest resources and potentially creating 
a market for sugar and cotton residues and energy 
crops. Moreover, a bio-energy strategy and master plan 
should be developed that take into account an in-depth 
assessment of the potential for a sustainable supply of 
feedstock to generate power.
Develop and adopt an electricity grid code 
A grid code is a critical element in the management 
and operation of a power system. As renewable power 
requires flexible conditions for adequate integration, 
The grid code must take account of options that would 
allow renewable power integration without jeopardising 
the grid safety and stability (IRENA, 2016a). 
Following RRA discussions, it was recommended that 
Mali develop and adopt a grid connection code that 
will, among others, permit third-party access to the grid 
in the case of IPPs. Mali also should provide guidelines 
and standards to accommodate renewable-based 
electricity. 
Consultation with relevant stakeholders is crucial, 
since grid connection codes impact on all those 
involved in the power system. By engaging the 
relevant parties, codes will be able to be implemented 
without placing the system in jeopardy. At the same 
time, responsibilities can be fairly shared between the 
stakeholders. Furthermore, best practices should be 
drawn from frontrunner countries in terms of how to 
integrate a high share of variable renewable energy into 
power systems. 
Another country’s grid codes cannot simply be copied 
without first considering the local context. This includes 
the size of the national power system (e.g. capacity, 
generation, consumption, assets, load profile) and its 
flexibility and distribution of generation and load; level 
of interconnection; voltage-level requirements; policy 
instruments that are in place to boost penetration 
of variable renewable energy; characteristics of 
conventional generators (e.g., fuel, technology, 
operational flexibility); and energy planning and power 
system operational practices (IRENA, 2016a). 
Further to adopting a grid code, establishing a revision 
process that is predictable will increase system 
reliability and security so that changes in technology 
and operational practices are easily adopted. This also 
will facilitate future system planning. A comprehensive 
guide to develop grid connection codes for the 
integration of renewables is available in Scaling Up 
Variable Renewable Power: The Role of Grid Codes 
(IRENA, 2016a)Enhance the enabling framework for private renewable 
energy investments and adopt robust renewable 
energy policies and regulatory schemes
The Regulatory Indicators for Sustainable Energy, a tool 
designed by the World Bank to assess national policy 
frameworks in order to promote access to modern 
energy services, energy efficiency and renewables, is a 
benchmark to establish the readiness of a country to 
support investments in sustainable energy. The most 
recent version of the tool scores Mali a 21 (“Few or no 
elements of a supportive policy framework have been 
enacted”) (ESMAP, 2018).
In its annual assessment of the global status of 
renewables deployment, REN21 highlights that 
although Mali has a renewable energy policy in place, 
there are yet to be regulatory instruments that support 
implementation. These should include feed-in tariffs 
and payment premiums; standards for electric utility 
quotas and renewables; net metering and billing; 
bio-fuel blend obligations/mandate; renewable heat 
obligations and mandate; tradable renewable energy 
credits; and tendering processes (REN21, 2019). REN21 
also notes the presence of tax incentives, as well as 
public loans and subsidies.
At the time of the RRA, public loan schemes targeting 
renewable energy deployment and policy in Mali 
were limited to the Renewable Energy Loan Project, 
supported by the World Bank. The project focused on 
the financing by local banks of solar home systems in 
an off-grid context, based on a government credit line. 
This innovative project, which has currently been put 
on hold, needs to be resumed upon the completion 
of an evaluation of its impacts. This initiative by itself 
is not sufficient to overcome the challenges Mali’s 
renewable energy sector faces, however, a successful 
implementation will be a driver for an uptake of 
renewable energy technologies.
In order for Mali to fulfil its renewable energy ambition, 
an overarching enabling policy framework is required 
that goes beyond the technology context and covers 
not only policies that facilitate access to finance, but 
also those to support the deployment of renewable 
(e.g. regulatory approaches such as feed-in policies 
or mandates and obligations; education and training; 
development of infrastructure). Other factors, such as 
the high level of political and economic risk in Mali, 
make private investment in renewables somewhat 
challenging. To be effective, policies require a stable 
regulatory environment - an issue that goes beyond the 
energy sector.
Provide risk mitigating solutions and promoting 
blended finance
In addition to the political and macroeconomic risks, 
Mali’s power utilities and traditional off-takers - as in 
most countries in sub-Saharan Africa - face serious 
obstacles in fulfilling payment obligations in a timely 
and reliable manner, based on their PPAs. As a result, 
banks shy away from providing loans to IPPs due to 
concerns that the debt will not be serviced according to 
schedule if IPPs are not paid on time for the power they 
deliver. Risk mitigation instruments (RMI) and initiatives 
(e.g. RLSF) should, therefore, be designed to speed up 
implementation of mature renewable energy projects. 
This can be achieved, for example, by reputable banks 
issuing standby letters of credit and providing the 
necessary collateral so that an IPP is able to operate for 
six months in the event of not being paid by the utility.
Other risk-mitigating solutions include political risk 
coverage (e.g. guarantees, insurance), interest rate and 
currency risk (e.g. interest rate and currency forwards, 
swaps) and resource risk, among others. These are 
offered by development finance institutions (DFI), 
insurers, export credit agencies and others, such as the 
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, Overseas 
Private Investment Corporation, Africa Trade Insurance 
Agency, Currency Exchange Fund, Agence Française 
de Développement, African Development Bank and 
GuarantCo, to name a few. Provision of RMIs is often a 
key to making renewable energy projects bankable and 
thus attracting private sector capital.
To understand and to facilitate access to such 
instruments, IRENA aims to launch an online platform 
for sector stakeholders (i.e. developers, lenders 
and other investors) to collect RMI data that relate 
to renewables, while at the same time providing a 
comprehensive overview of those RMIs that are available 
and information on how such instruments work.
In tandem with efforts to de-risk renewable energy 
projects, blended finance transactions should be 
encouraged to bring in local private capital into Mali’s 
renewable energy market, alongside institutions 
such as DFIs. Such transactions can take the form of 
syndications, on-lending and co-lending.21 and build 
the experience of local capital providers (to benefit 
from the experience of development banks in terms of 
renewable energy project finance), lower the cost of 
financing and distribute risks among a broader group 
of lenders (IRENA, 2016b). 
21 On-lending occurs when public finance institutions use their high credit rating to borrow debt at low rates, ultimately on-lending 
such debt to local institutions by way of low-interest credit lines. Co-lending (or syndication) is when multiple financiers provide 4.2. Off-grid renewables
Off-grid renewable solutions are crucial to achieve 
universal access to electricity, particularly in a country 
such as Mali where less than 20% of the rural population 
has access to power. Off-grid renewables will create 
opportunities and benefits beyond basic lighting and 
communication for rural communities, thus contributing 
to several development needs - most critically, an 
improvement in rural health services.
Based on the resource availability across Mali, the 
RRA process has identified hydropower, solar and bioenergy as suitable options. These are able to provide 
electrification and other energy services in remote 
areas. 
Going beyond enabling policies and effective regulatory 
frameworks, RRA discussions have focused on core 
priority areas. These include tariff regulations and main 
grid arrival policies, as well as quality control.
Adopt policies and regulations that support the 
growing mini-grid sector
Mali’s current rural electrification strategy relies on 
a decentralised mini-grid approach, co-ordinated by 
AMADER and funded through the various budgetary 
allocations and development programmes of 
international partners. There is an increased effort to 
convert most of the existing mini-grids - traditionally 
diesel-powered to hybrid systems and by limiting the 
issuance of new rural electrification permits to hybrid 
installations. permits. 
The current rural electrification approach has increased 
the electrification rate from 1% in 1999 to 17% in 2018. 
Despite this progress, two main areas of concern for 
private mini-grid investors are (i) to what extent does 
the type of support mechanism available for such 
investments apply over time and (ii) what regulatory 
framework is conducive for the sub-sector?
From an operational perspective, AMADER’s support 
to private operators ceases at the investment stage 
(with a subsidy of up to 80% of capital expenditure), 
leaving operators to navigate through the complex 
environment with no support. For most installations, 
imported diesel represents a significant portion of the 
expenses for private hybrid system operators.
Coupling this with a low revenue stream, there will be 
many instances whereby the monthly revenue will cover 
only one week’s provision of diesel, thus worsening 
the financial situation and, eventually, leading to 
the bankruptcy of many private operators. (due to 
bankruptcy, the number of private rural electrification 
operators have declined considerably from over 300 
to only 47 at present.) Such insolvency affects the 
business case for Mali’s rural electrification. 
Moreover, electricity is supplied for a maximum of 
12 hours a day (often for less) in order to minimise 
operator losses, given the high cost of fuel. Such limited 
electricity supply limits the economic activity in these 
remote, rural communities. If, however, approaches 
and business models for rural electrifications were to 
be consumer driven, an increase in electricity may well 
stimulate more consumption from mid- to high-power 
consumers, thus creating a deeper socio-economic 
impact and increase in the income of private operators.
On the revenue side, AMADER has instituted a fixed 
tariff regime to unify tariffs across rural areas. The tariffs 
in rural areas are driven by production costs, and are 
excessive (approximately USD 0.48-55/kWh) compared 
to those in urban areas (as low as USD 0.17/kWh). A 
fixed unified tariff that is not cost-reflective arguably 
will weaken the viability of current and prospective 
rural electrification projects in the country.
Given that this is the main concern of private operators, 
policies and support schemes should be tailored and 
sufficiently dynamic to effectively support a growing 
market. Moreover, effective regulation is essential, 
especially in the mini-grid sector. It should include 
flexible tariff setting for mini-grid projects to enable 
commercial viability; encourage innovation in the design 
and financing of technology and business models to 
reduce costs; establish quality control mechanisms for 
equipment; and improve efficiency.Box 4: What happens when the grid arrives?
 Country experiences
Conversion of mini-grids to (main) grid-connected 
small power producers has happened in various 
countries (e.g., Indonesia, Sri Lanka and the United 
Republic of Tanzania), whereby the main-grid operator 
then purchases the electricity produced from the 
mini-grid(s). A review of key success factors for such 
conversions highlights a combination of regulatory 
measures and social and economic motivators.
For instance, in Indonesia, a ministerial decree on 
Small Distributed Power Generation Using Renewable 
Energy requires the main grid operator to purchase 
electricity from mini-grids located near the main grid, 
as long as they were generating power from renewable 
energy sources.
Similarly, the United Republic of Tanzania’s newly 
revised small power producer framework outlines 
standardised power purchase tariffs and small power 
purchase agreements to enable mini-grids to sell 
electricity to the main grid or isolated grids that are 
owned by the national utility (Odorno et al., 2017). 
Cambodia’s success with converting a record 250 
mini-grids to small power distributors exemplifies 
the effectiveness of this strategy option for mini-grid 
survival. The study undertaken by the Energy Sector 
Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) highlights 
that Cambodia’s approach to incentivise mini-grid 
investors to standardise distribution infrastructure is 
through tariff top-ups, largely attributing to its success 
(Tennenbaum et al., 2018).
Develop a clear grid-arrival policy
In Mali, the untimely arrival of the national grid 
generates significant uncertainty in terms of the 
long-term viability of mini-grids, given that there 
are no concrete regulatory provisions (through 
interconnection and compensation mechanisms) for 
when the grid arrives. 
This risk has for long been one of the main challenges 
faced by private mini-grid operation worldwide, and 
several options to mitigate it have be proposed or 
issued by policymakers and regulators in recent years.
A recent ESMAP study (Tenenbaum et al., 2018) 
highlights five of the most common options.
• conversion to a main grid-connected SPP (Small 
Power Producer)
• conversion to an SPD (Small Power Distributor);
• conversion to serve as a main-grid SPP + SPD;
• allowing the mini-grid developer to serve 
customers, side by side to the main grid, but 
without interconnection; and
• ensuring that the mini-grid receives compensation 
and the main-grid operator takes over responsibility.
Mali is advised to adopt either of these options to 
mitigate the risks faced by the private mini-grid 
operators as far as grid-arrival is concerned. Develop quality control standards for renewable 
energy equipment and installers
In the Malian context, the market for rural electrification 
also should be leveraged to promote the local 
production of parts. An example is Horonya Solaire, 
a manufacturing company for the assembly of solar 
panels that employs approximately 30 people and 
has the capacity to produce up to 150 panels a day 
for national and regional markets. A larger and more 
dynamic market would boost the local industry by the 
manufacture of parts for solar installations, although this 
may require some co-ordination across the ECOWAS 
region in terms of synergy and complementarity. Such 
a stimulus, however, would raise the issue of quality 
control standards, which would require agreement at 
the national and regional levels, a topic that is currently 
being debated. 
To sustain this effort, the GoM may consider equipping 
AER-Mali with the necessary laboratory and other 
equipment to test locally manufactured and imported 
products with a view to setting equipment norms and 
standards that will sustain the market for renewable 
energy products. For a market to be sustainable, 
however, quality assurance is essential at various levels. 
Quality renewable energy equipment will provide the 
services expected only if systems are designed, installed 
and maintained by individuals who are highly qualified.
RRA discussions have emphasised the relative lack 
of highly qualified technicians for the sizing, design, 
installation and maintenance of solar systems in Mali. 
This being a common regional issue, IRENA is working 
with regional counterparts to establish a regional 
certification scheme (Box 5) for solar PV installers. Mali 
also could benefit from this scheme as a way in which 
to equip the local market with high-quality technicians 
to curb its technical skills shortage.
Box 5: Regional certification scheme for solar
 photovoltaic installers: West Africa
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) 
supports the Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy 
Efficiency (ECREEE) of the Economic Community of 
West African States (ECOWAS) in the establishment 
and piloting of a regionally harmonised scheme to build 
the human capacity of renewable energy resources in 
ECOWAS member states. The programme, Certification 
for Sustainable Energy Skills (ECSES), improves the 
of renewable energy workers, including off-grid solar 
photovoltaic (PV) technicians. The aim of the scheme 
is to support the development of renewable energy 
markets in ECOWAS countries. ECREEE serves as 
the governing body of the ECSES programme, with 
IRENA playing an advisory role until such time when a 
separate legal entity is established. The initiative also is 
supported by Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Internationale 
Zussamenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH.
The ECSES scheme requires technicians to undertake 
regionally agreed examinations based on a Job Task 
Analysis (JTA) to ensure a uniform competency level 
across the region. At present, the JTA for off-grid 
solar PV technicians, as well as operational processes 
and processes, examination content and procedures, 
have been developed in English and French with the 
support of IRENA and have been approved by ECOWAS 
members. 
The ECSES scheme has been successfully piloted with 
practical and written examinations having been held at 
the Ecole Supérieure Polytechnique in Dakar, Senegal in 
January 2019 and at the Kwame Nkrumah University of 
Science and Technology in June 2019 in Kumasi, Ghana. 
The scheme is being rolled out in other ECOWAS 
countries, with examinations scheduled in Burkina Faso, 
Cabo Verde and Nigeria during the third quarter of 
2019, while work has commenced on the development 
of JTAs for additional competencies, such as those for 
grid-connected solar PV, solar PV mini-grids and solar 
PV inspectors.4.3. Institutional setup and skills 
 reinforcement
Strengthen institutional processes
A more streamlined approach to institutional processes 
is essential for the effective uptake of renewables in 
Mali. The issue of overlapping institutional mandates 
has often been underscored, making it difficult to 
create synergy to meet their mandates.
In line with this, the Project Supporting the Promotion 
of Renewable Energies in Mali (Projet d’Appui à 
la Promotion des Energies Renouvelables au Mali, 
PAPERM), led by the Climate Investment Funds, aims to 
reform and streamline the energy sector by undertaken 
an in-depth analysis of the overall institutional and 
regulatory framework. This would enable the relevant 
institutions to assess policies and activities, as well as 
address, the shortcomings of Mali’s energy sector - in 
particular the shortage of skills - in a coherent manner.
Enhance technical capacities for large-scale 
deployment of renewable power
Assessing and improving the technical capabilities in 
terms of the availability of necessary human capacities 
across the value chain and the readiness, of support 
institutions, the grid infrastructure, etc. would increase 
the country’s readiness for integration of higher shares 
of variable renewable power. A tailor-made, capacitybuilding programme would improve the skills of key 
stakeholders, boosting the national and regional 
renewable energy planning systems and the regional 
power market. In this context, Mali, as a WAPP member, 
is able to benefit from IRENA’s capacity-building 
programme under the West Africa Clean Energy 
Corridor (WACEC) initiative that places emphasis not 
only on technical training in the planning and operation 
of grids with a higher share of renewable power, but 
also on study visits to a country that has substantial 
experience in the integration of variable renewable 
energy into its national grid. 
A further constraint in the deployment of gridconnected renewable power projects is the negotiation 
of PPAs. Thus far, PPAs in Mali are drawn up on a 
case-by-case basis and have been concluded only for 
hydro- and fossil fuel-based generation. Attracting 
investment for variable renewable-based power in the 
grid would be possible if the bankability of PPAs were 
strengthened. 
Mali should engage, therefore, in consultations to 
develop a standardised PPA to increase the bankability 
of renewable power projects. IRENA and Terrawatt 
Initiative are focusing on this particular challenge in 
collaboration with various working groups (e.g., law 
firms, financial institutions and other core industry 
stakeholders). Together, they have launched Open 
Solar Contracts, an initiative to standardise the key 
documents required in solar PV projects, including 
those relating to PPAs, operations and maintenance 
agreements, supply agreements, fit and commissioning 
agreements and finance facility agreements, as well as 
project development and implementation guidelines.
Strengthen local capacities in the development, 
appraisal and financing of bankable renewable energy 
projects
In addition to the policy and regulatory frameworks 
mentioned above, the current low level of private sector 
involvement in renewable energy investments in Mali 
also relates to a lack of awareness by the local financial 
sector on the technicalities and business propositions 
around renewables investment, leading to a perception 
that renewable energy projects are of high risk. As 
such, limited access by the various stakeholders to 
quality sector information and the lack of knowledge of 
the relevant risk allocation and mitigation methods of 
renewable energy projects are important factors. In an 
effort to foster an energy market that is private-sector 
inclusive, potential actors must be brought to the same 
level of knowledge, particularly specific to their needs.
Support for the private sector should also take the 
form of reinforcing local capabilities in terms of 
project preparation, development, financing and 
implementation. This would be essential for off-grid 
market operators, and would require international 
development partners that support bankable renewable 
energy projects.
Awareness campaigns in the form of training should be 
provided to local financial institutions to raise their level 
of understanding of renewable energy technologies in 
addition to building their capacity to develop financing 
lines for renewable energy projects. Given that Mali 
is involved in many regional political, financial and 
sectoral institutions, these capacity reinforcement 
efforts should be complemented by the World Bank’s 
Regional Off-Grid Electrification Project (ROGEP, 
implemented by ECREEE) that includes, among its 
components, the option of credit lines for several local 
commercial banks to enable them to support local 
entrepreneurs. This would provide an opportunity for 
the Malian private sector to access more financing from 
local commercial banks.Establish an effective energy data collection and 
management process, and build required capacities
As is the case in most sub-Saharan countries, the quest 
for reliable, consistent and up-to-date data on Mali’s 
energy situation and potential is daunting. Countries in 
West Africa have differing definitions and assumptions 
for basic indicators (e.g. rate of access to electricity, 
rate of coverage), as well as differing mechanisms for 
the collection and processing of statistical data. This 
leads to discrepancies between country data, despite 
field conditions being similar throughout the region. 
There is urgent need standardise indicator definitions 
across the region to the benefit of all countries.
Furthermore, sub-Saharan Africa should overcome 
its shortage of institutional and human resources 
necessary to gather accurate and timely energy and 
renewable energy statistics.
Box 6: IRENA tools and services to reduce project 
 costs and nurture the renewable energ market
Site Appraisals Service: For a country to effectively 
support an accelerated deployment of renewables, 
it needs to identify suitable project sites that are not 
only rich in resources but also financially viable. IRENA 
thus has developed its Site Appraisals Service to assess 
the financial pre-feasibility of wind and solar sites. The 
output of this assessment tool is a tariff that can act 
as a benchmark against comparable projects to assist 
countries in their power sector planning and project 
negotiation process. The service tool covers utility-scale 
wind and solar, solar storage systems and solar-diesel 
hybrid systems.
The site appraisals service tool is an innovative and 
cost-effective approach to screen prospective sites for 
solar and wind development in a specific country. It 
consists of two linked models for resource assessment 
and power generation and one as a simplified financial 
model. These serve to indicate the technical and 
economic feasibility of prospective solar and wind 
projects sites.
The service enables ministries and government entities 
to increase their chances of success, either by screening 
a list of potential wind or solar sites to select the most 
promising or by identifying, from relatively highpriority areas, those sites that are economically feasible 
as a precursor to carrying out further in-depth ground 
measurements. 
Site appraisals can also be used by local authorities in 
negotiation with prospective independent developers.
Project Navigator: This online platform provides 
comprehensive and practical information, as well as 
guidance, for the development of bankable renewable 
energy projects. The tool includes a project lifecycle 
process that is structured in various distinct phases, 
designed to support the progressive development 
of renewable energy projects. At this stage, technical 
concept guidelines are available for on-shore wind, 
solar photovoltaic, woody biomass, small hydro, minigrids and solar home systems.
Sustainable Energy Marketplace: This online platform 
connects project owners, financiers/investors, service 
providers and technology suppliers to bring projects to 
fruition. At the African hub of the Sustainable Energy 
Marketplace, IRENA conducts project assessments and 
provides an understanding of project requirements in 
the region. This data is then applied when matching 
and linking projects to financial institutions and other 
relevant stakeholders, depending on the project.
It should also address the lack of guidance to capture 
not only the emerging methodological challenges 
associated with renewable energy statistics, but also 
the rapid evolution in the production and consumption 
of renewable energy, often not reflected in a timely 
manner in official statistics.
Mali’s RRA process has faced various obstacles due to 
the lack of readily available statistical data to enable 
an assessment of critical energy sector indicators (e.g. 
total primary energy supply, energy consumption per 
sector, rural electrification rate). This is attributed to the 
absence of energy statistics training in ministries and 
governmental agencies, lack of funding and inadequate 
budgetary allocations for timely surveys and censuses, 
as well as an inability of statistics entities to retain 
qualified staff. Statistical capacity-building activities 
relating to the collection, processing and dissemination 
of renewable energy data will assist not only Mali but 
also West Africa, in general, to develop a systematic 
and effective data management process.Photograph: ShutterstockREFERENCES
