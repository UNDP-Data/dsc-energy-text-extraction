Country programme document
Nepal
Summary
The country programme document (CPD) for Nepal is presented to the Executive 
Board for discussion and approval at the present session, on a no objection basis. The
CPD includes a proposed aggregate indicative budget of $25,477,000 from regular 
resources, subject to the availability of funds, and $120,000,000 in other resources, 
subject to the availability of specific-purpose contributions, for the period March 2023 
to December 2027.
* E/ICEF/2023/1.Programme rationale
1. The population of Nepal was 29.19 million, including 10.45 million children, in 
2021.1 As the country is ageing fast, this “demographic window of opportunity” is 
rapidly closing.2 From 1990 to 2018, the urban population grew 2.9 per cent annually, 3
fuelled by rural-urban migration.
2. Nepal has achieved significant progress towards the Sustainable Development 
Goals, yet the country was hard hit by the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, 
with its long-term impact yet to be fully assessed. The economy grew at an average 
annual rate of 7 per cent between 2017 and 2019, 4recovering from a drop to 2 per 
cent in 2020, during the pandemic, to 5 per cent during the period 2021 –2022. Nepal 
is scheduled to graduate from its status as a least developed country in 2026. 
3. Pre-pandemic, multidimensional poverty had declined from 30.1 per cent to 17.4 
per cent between 2014–2019.
5
 However, significant disparities in relation to age, 
caste, disability, education, ethnicity, geography, gender, migration and wealth 
remain. Although children constitute 35 per cent of the population, they represent 44 
per cent of the poor, thus carrying a disproportionate poverty burden. The pandemic 
is estimated to have pushed 1.2 million people back into poverty.
6
4. The 2015 Constitution of Nepal envisions the country as an advanced, 
socialism-oriented economy, guaranteeing human rights – including child rights – by 
ensuring good governance and inclusive development in a federal, democratic and 
republican system of governance. As federalization advances, systems and capacities 
at federal, provincial and local government levels continue to evolve towards 
achieving decentralized socioeconomic development.
5. Progress, however, is threatened by climate change and the consequent 
heightened frequency and magnitude of disaster risks, 7rising air pollution, increasing 
incidence of other environmental health hazards, the risk of future pandemics and 
mega-earthquakes, all of which disproportionately affect children. 
6. Between 2014 and 2019, neonatal mortality declined from 23 to 16 deaths per 
1,000 live births; infant mortality decreased from 33 to 25 deaths per 1,000 live births; 
and the under-5 mortality rate decreased from 38 to 28 deaths per 1,000 live births, 
thus putting the Sustainable Development Goal 3 target for health within reach. 
Adolescent pregnancies and early childbearing contribute to higher neonatal and 
infant deaths.8 The availability of services for managing birth complications remains 
low.9 Up to 28 per cent of children among disadvantaged castes, as well as those in 
remote rural areas and poor urban communities, are not immunized. Priorities for the 
Nepal Health Sector Strategic Plan 2022–2030 include pandemic recovery of essential

environmental health risks, and addressing disparities in service delivery.
7. Stunting among children under the age of 5 years continued to decrease from 37 
per cent to 32 per cent between 2014 and 2019; yet this is not on track to achieve 
Sustainable Development Goal targets, and disparities persist across provinces, 
income, castes and ethnic groups. The prevalence of child wasting increased from 10 
per cent to 12 per cent between 2014 and 2019. Persisting child malnutrition is 
attributed to a combination of factors including poor maternal nutrition status, 
particularly among young adolescent mothers, with 46 per cent of pregnant women 
being anaemic. Social and gender norms further contribute to poor adolescent 
nutrition, with iron-deficiency anaemia in girls aged 10–19 years twice as prevalent 
as in boys. Poverty and poor feeding practices contribute to less than half of children 
aged 6–23 months meeting the minimum dietary diversity and only 30 per cent 
meeting the minimum acceptable diet, with further deterioration observed during the 
pandemic. 10 Efforts to tackle malnutrition have been strengthened through 
consecutive Government Multi-Sector Nutrition Plans.
8. Despite notable progress in access to basic drinking water services reaching 95 
per cent of the population in 2019, only 19 per cent of the population has access to 
safely managed drinking water related to limited investment and capacity. 11 The 
poorest children are seven times more likely to be without access to safe drinking 
water than those from the richest families. 12 About 5 per cent of the population have 
reverted to open defecation, due to social norms, challenging the country’s open 
defecation-free status.13 While 78 per cent of schools had improved water sources and 
83 per cent improved sanitation facilities, very few have met the quality standards for 
gender and disability. 14 Climate change poses increased risks of depletion and 
contamination of water sources, especially for pipe-water supply, impacting people in 
hills and urban areas.15
9. Nepal has made substantial progress in raising enrolment rates to 88 per cent in 
early childhood education and 95 per cent in basic education in 2020/21. However, 
only 34 per cent of girls and 31 per cent of boys completed a full 12 years of schooling, 
and there were more than 420,000 children out of school. 16 Only two fifths of schoolage girls and boys achieved a foundation level of literacy or numeracy, with poorer 
learning outcomes among children from disadvantaged groups and underserved 
communities. Despite innovative programmes to support continuity of learning, the 
extended school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to have caused 
a substantial loss of learning and to have further exacerbated weaknesses in access, 
quality and equity. The School Education Sector Plan17 aims to improve equity in the 
education sector and accelerate progress on recovering the learning loss.

liif diid hlhl dl10. The country’s commitment to child rights is enshrined in the Constitution. 
Despite progressive legislation and policies, 18 violence, including gender-based 
violence and exploitation affecting children, especially adolescent girls, remain major 
concerns. While child labour had decreased from 1.8 to 1.1 million between 2008 and 
2018, 19 rising trends in child labour and trafficking were reported during the 
pandemic.20 With 33 per cent of girls getting married before the age of 18 years, child 
marriage rates remain persistently high despite a law outlawing the practice.21 The 
incidence of physical and psychological violence, particularly gender-based violence, 
increased dramatically during the pandemic, with 80 per cent of the reported victims 
of gender-based violence being minors, mostly adolescent girls. 22 Children also 
increasingly face greater risks of online sexual abuse and exploitation.
23
11. COVID-19 exacerbated mental health concerns, with a 40 per cent increase in 
teenage suicide rates 24 adding to the trauma experienced by victims of violence, 
including gender-based violence. The majority of adolescents reported experiencing 
stress and symptoms of depression during the pandemic. 25 Mental health issues 
remain stigmatized, affecting the take-up of psychosocial counselling and emerging 
mental health services. 
12. Social protection schemes cover 25 per cent of the population. 26 Despite being 
disproportionately poor and representing 36 per cent of the population, children 
receive only 6 per cent of the social protection budget through the Child Grant. Only 
13.7 per cent of persons with disabilities received cash benefits. 27 Despite advances 
in the Civil Registration and Vital Statistics system, an estimated 23 per cent of 
children under the age of 5 years do not have birth certificates and are not covered by 
the safety net.
13. Key lessons learned from the current country programme and the COVID-19 
pandemic response include: the need for greater focus on developing provincial and 
local government capacities to strengthen child-friendly systems and services; the 
importance of wealth, geography, mobility, ethnicity, caste, gender and disability 
considerations to be reflected not only in policies and plans, but also in equity-focused 
programming and budget allocations to close gaps in service coverage; and the 
imperative to further accelerate climate mitigation and disaster resilience approaches 
across all programmes.
Programme priorities and partnerships 
14. The country programme is aimed at supporting the Government to ensure all 
children, including adolescents, realize their rights and have opportunities to develop 
their full potential, free from poverty, in an inclusive, protective society and in a s afe 
and sustainable climate and environment. UNICEF will contribute to children –
especially the most disadvantaged – increasingly utilizing inclusive, improved quality 
health, nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene, education and child protection

hdf bfservices and accessing social protection benefits, protected from disasters and other 
shocks. Considering the triple challenges of Sustainable Development Goal 
attainment, pandemic recovery and climate change-induced disasters, the country 
programme will support Nepal in maximizing the remaining ‘demographic window 
of opportunity’ by developing the human capital of the currently large cohort of 
children. Geographically, it will focus on the most deprived and disaster-prone areas, 
including remote rural and poor urban areas and the hardest-to-reach children.
15. The country programme has six components: health; nutrition; climate-resilient 
water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH); education; child protection; and social 
protection and child-friendly governance. Four overarching priorities will permeate 
the programme:
(a) Child-friendly governance building capacities for child-friendly 
policies, plans, strategies, programmes, resource allocations and strengthening 
service delivery systems at national, provincial and local government levels involving 
children, families and communities.
(b) Gender-equality programming by promoting the well-being and
agency of adolescent girls through equitable schooling and skills development, 
adolescent health and nutrition, positive gender norms, enhanced protection and 
prevention of child marriage, early pregnancy and gender-based and other violence, 
and mental health support.
(c) Social inclusion focus addressing disparities by age, caste, disability, 
education, ethnicity, geography, gender, migration and wealth status by modelling 
effective, equity-focused service delivery approaches.
(d) Disaster risk reduction, climate resilience and environmental 
sustainability building community resilience, child-sensitive climate adaptation and 
mitigation models, and enhancing child-centred disaster risk reduction and emergency 
response capacities of young people and government.
16. The following strategies will support these overarching priorities across the 
components:
(a) Multisectoral convergent programming to achieve catalytic results for 
children from early childhood to adolescence and for those with a disability;
(b) Social and behaviour change to promote positive gender and social norms, 
behaviours and practices that foster transformative programming;
(c) Child rights advocacy and participation to engage children and influencers 
in advocacy with decision makers and to mobilize the public for action, including 
through the U-Report mechanism;
(d) Evidence, data and analysis to facilitate knowledge leadership on children 
to inform policy, financing and implementation;
(e) Innovation, including access to and use of digital technologies, to deliver 
innovative programming for children;
(f) Public-private partnerships, including with development partners, civil 
society, the private sector, academia and the media to leverage resources and co-create 
programming for children.
17. The country programme builds on Nepal’s significant progress and commitment 
towards the Sustainable Development Goals. It contributes to the country’s Fifteenth 
and emergent Sixteenth Plan and national sectoral and multisectoral strategies, plans 
and frameworks. It is aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and 
its Sustainable Development Goals, the UNICEF Strategic Plan, 2022–2025 and the 
Uid NiSiblDlCiFk (UNSDCF) 2023 2027, under which UNICEF will coordinate the inclusive and transformative human 
development outcome and contribute to all other outcomes, enhancing its joint and 
complementary work with other United Nations entities. The country programme 
formulation has been informed by consultations with central, provincial and local 
governments, development partners, including United Nations agencies, civil society 
and private-sector stakeholders, and children. 
Health
18. This component is aimed at ensuring children, pregnant and lactating women, 
and their caregivers, especially the most vulnerable in underserved rural and periurban communities, utilize high-impact accessible, quality health interventions and 
practise healthy behaviours. The programme also aims to contribute to addressing 
mental health concerns and the impact of air pollution and re-emerging vector-borne 
diseases brought on by climate and environmental changes, as well as noncommunicable diseases and disability.
19. In partnership with the Ministry of Health and Population and partners, UNICEF 
will contribute to improved health policies, strategies and an enabling multisectoral 
policy environment. The programme will prioritize health system strengthening in 
support of pandemic recovery and Nepal’s Health Sector Strategic Plan 2022–2030 to 
achieve Sustainable Development Goal 3 within the framework of the health Sector 
Wide Approach and UNSDCF Outcome 2.
20. To support the country’s federalization, UNICEF will contribute to improving 
national, select provincial and local government capacities and systems strengthening, 
facilitating a locally driven planning approach to improve maternal, newborn, child 
and adolescent health outcomes. UNICEF will model service delivery approaches and 
contribute to strengthening primary health-care and health-seeking behaviour using 
immunization services as an entry point, with particular focus on reaching missed 
communities and zero-dose children.
21. Health institutional and front-line worker capacities will be enhanced to improve 
the delivery of maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health-care interventions. 
Strategies will include a gradual shift from service delivery to evidence-informed 
system strengthening, promoting digital transformation, community and child 
engagement and social behaviour change, as well as advocacy for improved policies 
and costed plans at all levels. 
Nutrition
22. This component is aimed at the prevention and reduction of wasting, stunting 
and micronutrient deficiencies among children and at improving women’s nutrition, 
with a focus on adolescent girls and the most underserved communities, including 
peri-urban areas. In support of Nepal’s Multi-Sector Nutrition Plan and in 
contribution to UNSDCF Outcome 2, UNICEF will facilitate improvements in diets, 
positive nutrition practices and integrated services implemented by line ministries 
responsible for education, food, health, nutrition, social protection, and water and 
sanitation and coordinated by the National Planning Commission.
23. In the federalization context, UNICEF will strengthen nutrition governance by 
enhancing the capacities of select provincial and municipal governments and 
decentralized health and nutrition institutions to plan, budget and implement
equitable, gender-responsive, disability inclusive policies, programmes and protocols 
for scaling up prevention, early detection and treatment of all forms of malnutrition 
in children, adolescents and women. Special focus will be on equipping health and nutrition professionals with the requisite knowledge and skills to promote childcentred feeding and care practices
24. The programme will support small-scale modelling of effective gender and 
equity-focused strategies targeting the most left-behind children and women, and
advocate for application and scale-up through national and subnational policies, 
programmes and resource allocations. Evidence-based strategies for community 
engagement and social behaviour change will inform improved community-level 
feeding and parenting practices and behaviours.
Climate-resilient water, sanitation and hygiene
25. This component is aimed at ensuring that more children and their families, 
especially girls, women, and children with disabilities and from underserved 
communities, equitably access and use safe, climate-resilient, gender-responsive 
WASH services and adopt hygiene behaviours, with a focus on provinces 
experiencing the highest threats to water security and quality. The component will 
further contribute to multisectoral efforts to leverage child-sensitive climate change 
mitigation and environmental sustainability policies, plans and measures that engage 
adolescents. It contributes to the WASH Sector Development Plan, the National 
Adaption Plan and Nationally Determined Contributions, and UNSDCF Outcomes 2 
and 3, guided by the Ministry of Water Supply and the National Disaster Risk 
Reduction and Management Authority.
26. The programme will support enhanced access to sustainable and safely 
managed, climate-resilient water and sanitation services including menstrual hygiene 
management in households, schools and health facilities, particularly in underserved 
rural and urban slum areas, and contribute to sustaining the country’s open defecation 
free status. UNICEF will strengthen disaster-resilient systems, promote groundwater 
recharge and the use of alternative energy and proven water conservation 
technologies, working in partnership with the Government and the private sector. 
27. To support federalization, UNICEF will continue to enhance the planning and 
implementation capacity of provincial and local governments with a focus on rolling 
out the municipal WASH plans, including improved data through the NWASH tool, 
institutional strengthening, resource allocation, monitoring and reporting. The 
programme will enable water and sanitation user committees to enhance water quality
management sustainably and to promote resilience in times of water scarcity.
28. The programme will further leverage child-centric climate adaptation models in 
national flagship programmes and empower adolescents as agents of change for 
climate change adaptation, environmental sustainability and disaster risk reduction 
measures in their communities, working through the Child and Youth Clubs.
Education
29. This component is aimed at enabling children to complete a full course of good 
quality education in an equitable, inclusive and safe environment, with a particular 
focus on children from the most disadvantaged communities. UNICEF will contribute 
to Nepal’s School Education Sector Plan within the framework of the education Sector 
Wide Approach and UNSDCF Outcome 2.
30. In collaboration with the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, the 
programme will intensify efforts to address chronically low levels of learning in Nepal 
as well as recover the pandemic learning loss. The programme will equip children 
with the foundational skills needed to complete their education, by prioritizing early 
grades literacy and numeracyparticularly among girlschildren with disabilitiestongue. UNICEF will advocate for greater policy commitment and enhanced resource 
allocation for equitable and inclusive education.
31. To support federalization, UNICEF will support three tiers of government to 
develop comprehensive policies, common framework for capacity development and 
costed education plans. The programme will strengthen education capacities and 
systems to support children’s school readiness, improve children’s learning and create 
safe and child-friendly schools. UNICEF will develop alternative pathways and 
digital offerings to help out-of-school children to re-enter school or acquire essential 
life skills. The programme will address harmful social and gender norms in education 
to enable more girls, children with disabilities, and those from disadvantaged 
communities to have an equitable education chance.
Child protection
32. This component will support Nepal to build an inclusive, protective environment 
that prevents and responds to violence, exploitation and abuse against children and 
women. It is aimed at ensuring that children, especially adolescent girls, those with 
disabilities, from disadvantaged caste and ethnic minorities, and migrant families 
receive improved protective services including birth registration, prevention and 
response to gender-based and other forms of violence, particularly child marriage, 
child labour and trafficking, and sexual exploitation. The programme will contribute 
to UNSDCF Outcomes 2 and 4, the Act Relating to Children 2018, the National Child 
Policy and the National Master Plan on Child Labour 2018–2028, working in 
collaboration with the Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizens, other 
relevant government entities, and partners.
33. In the federal context, UNICEF will strengthen capacities of central, select 
provincial and local governments to develop inclusive policies, legislation and 
regulatory frameworks, costed plans and integrated monitoring systems, and leverage 
increased public financing for child protection. The programme will contribute to 
developing child-friendly social welfare and justice systems and to building relevant 
workforce capacities at selected subnational levels to ensure quality child protection 
services, including safe reporting, survivor-centred assistance and strengthened 
accountability for child survivors.
34. The programme will prioritize social and behaviour change and child 
participation approaches in engaging with community, government and other 
stakeholders to address social norms that drive harmful and abusive practices and to 
promote positive social norms.
Social protection and child-friendly governance
35. This component will contribute to multisectoral collaborative efforts to reduce 
multidimensional poverty, strengthen household resilience to shocks and stress, and 
foster child-friendly governance across the three government tiers. UNICEF will 
apply a system strengthening data and capacity-building approach to: enhancing the 
quality and use of disaggregated data and evidence on children to inform inclusive 
planning and budgeting; promoting child-centred public finance management 
systems; building a more coordinated, shock-responsive and child-sensitive social 
protection system; and strengthening integrated child-focused social sector planning 
and implementation, particularly at provincial and local levels. The programme will 
contribute to UNSDCF Outcomes 1, 2 and 4.
36. UNICEF will support the national and selected provincial and local governments 
to operationalize the Integrated National Social Protection Framework and to enhance Statistics system, the National Shock-Responsive Social Protection Framework, the 
universal Child Grant programme, and the provincial Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao 
programme. It will also innovate on cash-plus models. 
37. To support federalization, UNICEF will build capacities of national and targeted 
provincial and local authorities to develop child-friendly policies, strategies and 
budgets that enable improved delivery of quality social services. Engagement with 
parliamentarians, media and citizens, particularly children, will enhance transparency.
38. UNICEF will support national disaggregated data surveys and real-time 
monitoring analysis. It will also strengthen research capacities and networks to 
generate, analyse and disseminate evidence to inform equitable planning and financial 
investments for children.
Programme effectiveness
39. This component is aimed at ensuring that the country programme is effectively 
coordinated, managed, monitored and supported at all levels to meet quality 
programming standards in achieving results for children, including through efficient 
operational support. It will facilitate programme leadership and coordination for riskinformed programming, emergency preparedness and response, community 
engagement, social and behaviour change, advocacy and communication.

Programme and risk management 
40. The country programme will be coordinated by the Ministry of Finance and the 
National Planning Commission, while programme components will be managed by 
relevant ministries, and provincial and local governments, in collaboration with 
development partners, civil society and the private sector. UNICEF will contribute to 
development partner and UNSDCF coordination across the social sectors. As 
humanitarian cluster lead for Nutrition, WASH, Education and Protection, UNICEF 
will support the Government in preparedness, partner coordination and response to 
disasters and other emergencies and foster humanitarian-development programming 41. The country programme will be risk-informed to address assessed threats to 
children and to planned results. UNICEF will mitigate disaster risks through 
continued enhancement of emergency preparedness and response capacities of 
disaster management authorities. Risks of sexual exploitation and abuse will be 
mitigated through comprehensive prevention and response measures for staff and 
partners. Risks posed by reduced investments in children due to shrinking fiscal space 
and development aid uncertainties will be mitigated through enhanced leveraging of 
public and private resources and prioritization of high impact cost-effective strategies.
42. This country programme document outlines UNICEF contributions to national 
results and serves as the primary unit of accountability to the Executive Board for 
results alignment and resources assigned to the programme at the country level. 
Accountabilities of managers at the country, regional and headquarters levels 
concerning country programmes are prescribed in the organization’s programme and 
operations policies and procedures.
Monitoring, learning and evaluation
43. The results and resources framework, the costed evaluation plan and the 
Integrated Monitoring and Evaluation Plan will form the basis for outcome and output 
monitoring and reporting. They are aligned with the results frameworks of the 
country’s Fifteenth Plan and sector plans/strategies and the UNSDCF. Annual reviews 
with the Government and partners will assess progress, identify opportunities and 
risks and make appropriate programming adjustments.
44. UNICEF will support the Central Bureau of Statistics and line ministries to 
strengthen Sustainable Development Goal data management, particularly through the 
Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, routine management information and monitoring 
systems of government programmes to ensure systematic collection, analysis and 
progress monitoring of the situation of children, with special focus on caste, ethnicity, 
disability, gender equality and social inclusion.
45. UNICEF will enhance its capacity-building support for improved monitoring, 
statistical and evaluation capacities at provincial and municipal levels, enabling local 
government programming that is responsive to the specific vulnerabilities of children. 
Building on good practice during the pandemic, UNICEF will continue the real-time 
situation monitoring and enhance its field monitoring to inform programmatic 
strategies.E/ICEF/2023/P/L.1
