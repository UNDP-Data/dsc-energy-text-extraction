Solar PV: Solar resource potential has been divided into seven classes, 
each representing a range of annual PV output per unit of capacity 
(kWh/kWp/yr). The bar chart shows the proportion of a country's land area 
in each of these classes and the global distribution of land area across the 
classes (for comparison).
Onshore wind: Potential wind power density (W/m2) is shown in the seven 
classes used by NREL, measured at a height of 100m. The bar chart shows 
the distribution of the country's land area in each of these classes 
compared to the global distribution of wind resources. Areas in the third 
class or above are considered to be a good wind resource.
Biomass: Net primary production (NPP) is the amount of carbon fixed by 
plants and accumulated as biomass each year. It is a basic measure of 
biomass productivity. The chart shows the average NPP in the country 
(tC/ha/yr), compared to the global average NPP of 3-4 tonnes of carbon 
= Global average of 3-4 tC/ha/yr

(original sources: WHO; World Bank; IEA; IRENA; and UNSD); UN World Population 
Prospects; UNSD Energy Balances; UN COMTRADE; World Bank World Development 
Indicators; EDGAR; REN21 Global Status Report; IEA-IRENA Joint Policies and Measures

Atlas.
 
Additional notes: Capacity per capita and public investments SDGs only apply to 
developing areas. Energy self-sufficiency has been defined as total primary energy 
production divided by total primary energy supply. Energy trade includes all 
commodities in Chapter 27 of the Harmonised System (HS). Capacity utilisation is 
calculated as annual generation divided by year-end capacity x 8,760h/year. Avoided 
emissions from renewable power is calculated as renewable generation divided by fossil 
fuel generation multiplied by reported emissions from the power sector. This assumes 
that, if renewable power did not exist, fossil fuels would be used in its place to generate 
the same amount of power and using the same mix of fossil fuels. In countries and years 
where no fossil fuel generation occurs, an average fossil fuel emission factor has been 
used to calculate the avoided emissions.
These profiles have been produced to provide an overview of developments in 
renewable energy in different countries and areas. The IRENA statistics team would 
welcome comments and feedback on its structure and content, which can be sent to
