THE REPUBLIC OF
ALBANIA
Renewables Readiness AssessmentThe Government of Albania recognises the key role of the energy sector in 
the economic development of the country. Albania is therefore giving new 
impetus to energy reforms while also consolidating existing efforts to both 
provide enabling conditions for renewable energy development and comply 
with its regional and international commitments.
As part of this, the government asked the International Renewable Energy 
Agency (IRENA) to conduct a Renewables Readiness Assessment (RRA) 
study for Albania. The assessment, prepared in co-operation with the Ministry 
of Infrastructure and Energy (MIE), outlines key issues for ongoing energy 
sector development. It identifies important short- to medium-term actions 
to strengthen policy, regulatory and institutional frameworks, aiming to 
accelerate renewable energy uptake and bring the targets of Albania’s 
National Energy Sector Strategy 2030 within reach.
This report follows consultations with stakeholders across the sector that 
helped to identify challenges and devise solutions to accelerate renewable 
energy uptake. The resultant, comprehensive work highlights the main 
obstacles and proposes measures to move forward with an ambitious 
renewable energy scenario.
The RRA findings come at the right time to help us establish a clear strategic 
roadmap for renewables in Albania. While the market has witnessed 
considerable advances in recent years, we are now more determined than 
ever to step up the investments that will shape our energy future.
On behalf of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy, I would like to thank 
IRENA for undertaking and carrying out the RRA process in Albania. I am 
also grateful to all the representatives and stakeholders who contributed. The 
work invested in this report will have a significant, positive impact on Albania's 
energy transition in the coming years, making us more determined than ever 
to invest in a better, more sustainable future.

FOREWORD
From the Minister of Infrastructure and EnergyFOREWORD
From the IRENA Director-General
As the countries of South-East Europe devise economic recovery plans to 
prepare for the post-pandemic future, they see the chance to accelerate their 
renewable energy uptake, reduce carbon dioxide emissions and align with the 
broader energy and climate vision of the European Union.
While Albania’s energy mix already features one of the highest shares of 
renewables in the region owing to its extensive installed hydropower capacity, 
the essential need remains for a more secure, cost-competitive national 
energy supply. 
Diversifying the electricity mix to include more renewables would strengthen 
Albania’s energy security. Fossil fuels – mainly crude oil – account for more 
than half of total primary energy supply, while domestic hydropower supply 
varies widely with weather and climate conditions.
With annual energy demand set to grow by about 75% over the decade, 
the need for clean, sustainable power is more urgent than ever. Non-hydro 
renewables, such as solar and wind power, can contribute to a secure, stable, 
affordable national energy supply. 
Renewable energy technologies would also bring numerous socio-economic 
benefits, including job creation, new income streams, local industrial 
development and reduced air pollution. All these result in higher GDP and 
improve people’s overall welfare.
This assessment, produced in conjunction with the Ministry of Infrastructure 
and Energy, aims to support Albania in its energy transition. It recommends 
measures to integrate renewables faster, including through least-cost energy 
master planning, refurbishing existing distribution networks, allowing for 
bidirectional electricity flow and establishing priority zones for solar and wind 
power projects. 
As a first step, this report aims to inform the National Energy and Climate Plan 
for 2021–2030 and make subsequent energy development more conducive
to renewables. 
Since 2011, more than 40 countries throughout 40 countries throughout 
Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and the Pacific 
have undertaken similar Renewables Readiness Assessment (RRA) studies, 
exchanging knowledge and fostering international co-operation to accelerate 
the deployment of renewables. Each process has been country-led, with IRENA 
providing technical expertise and highlighting regional and global insights, 
along with facilitating consultations among different national stakeholders. 
IRENA is grateful to the Albanian authorities – and particularly the Ministry of 
Infrastructure and Energy – for their support, as well as to other stakeholders 
whose insights have enriched this study. I am confident that the observations 
and recommendations presented here will help to strengthen the energy 
transition in Albania and the broader region.

Throughout this publication, The designation of Kosovo* is without prejudice to positions on status
and the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999).The Republic of Albania is a predominantly 
mountainous, coastal country in South-East Europe 
with a population of approximately 2.9 million 
people. Albania has made significant economic 
progress during the past three decades, moving 
from a low-income economy to a middle-income 
EU member state, with a gross domestic product 
(GDP) per capita that has risen from USD 200 in 
1991 to USD 5 353 in 2019. 
Albania remains a net importer of goods and 
services. Energy imports, in particular, restrict 
economic growth considerably, have a negative 
effect on the country’s trade deficit and leave the 
country open to supply shocks.
Albania’s energy mix is dominated by fossil 
fuels – mainly crude oil – which account for more 
than half of total primary energy supply (TPES). 
However, domestic production is not able to meet 
demand; Albania is therefore, on average, a net 
energy importer. 
Hydropower accounts for the largest share of the 
country’s electricity generation, representing around 
95% of the Albania’s installed power capacity. This 
means Albania’s energy mix has one of the highest 
shares of renewable energy in South East Europe; 
however, it is also highly dependent on annual 
rainfall. The consequent vulnerability to climatic 
externalities for electricity production creates 
notable fluctuations in domestic energy production. 
Aside from the socio-economic implications of 
its extensive reliance on hydro-power, Albania is 
among the most vulnerable of South-East Europe’s 
countries to climate change, according to the World 
Bank, and changing weather patterns have already 
resulted in increased temperatures, decreased 
precipitation and more frequent extreme events 
such as floods and droughts.
Establishing energy security, energy sector 
sustainability and an ensured energy supply at 
cost-competitive prices are therefore some of the 
key challenges for the country to address in the 
near term. These challenges can be met by further 
increasing the share of renewable energy in the 
national energy mix and diversifying the country’s 
electricity sector.
Opportunities for the deployment of solar 
energy are extensive. Albania’s solar insolation 
is very high throughout most of its territory at 
more than 1 500 kWh/m2
 annually, with peaks of
1 753 kWh/m2
 annually, particularly in the western 
part of the country. Albania also has some of 
Europe’s highest number of sunshine hours 
per year, presenting significant potential for 
development of solar PV for power generation and 
solar thermal for heating purposes. 
Meanwhile, according to IRENA’s estimates 
under a low-cost capital scenario, Albania has a
cost-competitive wind potential of up to 7 400 MW 
and the Agency proposes in its REmap scenario a 
wind installed capacity of 616 MW by 2030, with 
an annual generation potential of 1 794 GWh.
In recent years, the Albanian government has 
taken commendable steps in the promotion of
non-hydro renewable energy use. In its 2018 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARYNational Energy Sector Strategy, Albania stipulated 
a 42% share of renewable energy in total primary 
energy supply (TPES) by 2030. Also, Albania’s 
National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) 
sets forth renewable energy targets till 2020 and 
in going forward, the NREAP will be superseded 
by the National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP), 
which is still to be developed and will set out 
renewable energy targets to 2030. 
With a view to informing the development of these 
targets, and more generally to support Albania on 
its path toward the integration of a higher, more 
diversified share of renewable energy in its national 
energy mix, this Renewables Readiness Assessment 
(RRA) identifies critical actions that could significantly 
impact the scale-up of renewable energy, outlined in 
a number of key recommendations.
Developing renewable energy zones
For solar and wind resources in Albania, analysis 
of availability and economic potential is very 
limited. This hinders policy development in setting 
achievable targets. In particular, zoning for solar PV 
and wind generation projects should be prioritised. 
This entails the identification of areas of highquality resource potential for power development, 
the exploitation of which is environmentally sound 
and both technically and economically viable.
The Albanian National Agency of Natural Resources 
(AKBN), as the institution tasked with gathering 
resource potential data, should therefore lead 
the development of a renewable energy zoning 
study for solar and wind, in co-operation with the 
Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy (MIE) and 
development partners, using IRENA’s potential 
suitability analysis presented in the RRA as a basis.
Developing a comprehensive least-cost energy 
master plan
A comprehensive energy plan can support 
effective decision-making and guide the sector’s 
development in a coherent way, offering clarity 
and visibility for various energy stakeholders, 
including investors and development partners. 
The planning department of the MIE, along with 
the AKBN, are encouraged to take the lead in 
developing a holistic least-cost master plan for the 
energy sector to aggregate sub-sectoral plans and 
assess the accompanying infrastructure needed to 
reach overall energy goals. Specifically, this plan 
should guide when, where and how investments in 
the energy sector should be made. 
Strengthening the distribution network
The Albanian distribution network suffers from 
overloading in high-demand centres, such as in 
Tirana, posing serious obstacles to the injection of 
distributed generation such as solar PV net-metering 
systems. The distribution system operator, OSHEE, 
must immediately prioritise the refurbishment of 
the distribution grid around the main load centres 
of Tirana and Durrës; begin planning for an active 
grid that can allow for bidirectional electricity flow 
to accommodate renewable energy prosumers; and 
initiate grid upgrades close to planned renewable 
energy generation zones so that power can be 
effectively evacuated to major demand centres. Strengthening support mechanisms for 
renewable energy deployment
Although Albania has made progressive efforts 
to establish various support incentives for the 
greater uptake of renewables, these could be 
further strengthened, for example by reducing 
VAT to incentivise deployment. Whilst exempted 
in some cases of imported solar PV machinery and 
equipment, in the domestic sale of equipment – 
especially for systems below 500 kW – the full 20% 
VAT is applied. VAT reductions could therefore be 
applied on all machinery and equipment related to 
all renewable energy technologies. Furthermore, 
the renewable energy financing obligation for 
those who purchase directly from the transmission 
system operator should be embedded into 
electricity pricing for non-tariff consumers 
connected to the transmission system (about 
10–12% of consumers). 
Establishing a dedicated renewable energy 
agency
Albania requires a dedicated renewable energy 
agency, with its own funding stream unconstrained 
by treasury limitations, to inform the coordinated 
development of renewables in line with national and 
international obligations. Based on an envisaged 
mandate stipulated within the Renewable Energy 
Law, such an agency could also keep an updated 
registry of renewable power producers and service 
providers; collaborate for training, certification 
and capacity building; track the energy balance 
contributions of all energy stakeholders and draft 
timely assessments; monitor the effectiveness 
and implementation of energy sector master 
plans; carry out resource potential analyses and 
pre-feasibility studies for renewable energy 
resource development; and provide transparent 
information on renewable energy data, incentives, 
energy sector development plans and permitting 
procedures for the public and private sectors.
Developing a strategy for a greener transport 
sector
Greening the transport sector through e-mobility 
has the potential to positively contribute to the 
balancing of the power system through peak-load 
shaving, reducing distribution losses and reducing 
air pollution. An overall energy strategy aimed at 
the diversification of the transport sector should 
be developed as a cross-sectoral collaborative 
effort between relevant authorities and both the 
MIE and Energy Regulatory Authority (ERE) to 
ensure a coordinated and coherent development 
pathway for both the energy and transport 
sectors. Such a strategy could also encourage the 
uptake of locally produced biofuels – including 
biodiesel, bioethanol and bio-methane – which 
should be produced in compliance with biomass 
sustainability criteria and which have the potential 
to reduce Albania’s current dependence on oil 
imports while improving air quality in urban 
centres and diversifying agriculture and rural 
economies. 
Developing a heat bylaw
A dedicated heat bylaw is required to provide for 
appropriate target-setting beyond 2020 for heating 
and cooling and accompanying technologies 
(such as solar thermal and geothermal) across the 
residential, services and industrial sectors. This 
should also provide guidance on the mechanisms 
for the deployment of heating technologies 
and methodologies for their contribution to the 
renewable energy share, especially with regards 
to the use of heat pumps. Currently, heat pumps 
are inadequately accounted for in data reporting 
on the national share of renewable energy. The 
Law on Energy Efficiency and the Law on Energy 
Efficiency in Buildings could be also linked directly 
to the heat bylaw so that energy efficiency 
measures would play a complimentary role in 
reducing heating and cooling demand.
Facilitating financing of bankable project 
proposals
Many renewable energy project proposals are 
discredited as “unbankable” due to the lack of 
thoroughly developed supporting documentation. 
The private sector should therefore utilise openly 
available tools and platforms, such as the Climate 
Investment Platform (CIP), for developing 
bankable project proposals and accessing 
financing. Also, thoroughly developed power 
purchase agreements (PPAs) are a key element 
in de-risking investments in renewable energy 
projects and can offset some of the perceived 
risk in project appraisal by financing institutions.Local financial institutions can also play an 
increasingly prominent role in financing smallerscale distributed systems by tailoring existing 
lending portfolios to include electric vehicles 
(under conventional vehicle loans) and rooftop 
solar PV, energy efficiency measures or efficient 
heat pumps (under housing loans). 
Raising public awareness of the benefits
of renewable energy 
From the perspective of energy consumers, high 
upfront investment costs in renewable energy and 
a lack of understanding of payback periods for 
such investments deter wider uptake of renewables 
in Albania. Also, the public is not always aware of 
existing incentives, support mechanisms or plans for 
the deployment of renewable energy technologies. 
Therefore, the wider adoption of renewable energy 
in Albania requires government-backed, wellformulated awareness-raising strategies to sensitise 
the public to the direct benefits of renewable energy, 
both for individual citizens and the country as a 
whole. Coherently communicating the government’s 
plans for the development of the sector will also 
serve to boost investor confidence. 
Enhancing institutional capacities and local 
human resources
To implement Albania’s commitment to a higher 
share of renewable energy deployment, a skilled 
workforce is required. The ministries in charge of 
energy, training and education should collectively 
work towards the introduction of renewable 
energy training curricula, prioritising solar PV 
installers and energy auditors in the immediate 
term. In particular, the MIE, together with the 
Energy Efficiency Agency – the certifying body for 
energy auditors – should work on expediting the 
licencing of accredited energy auditors. 
INSTAT, as the central body accumulating and 
processing statistical data, should work with AKBN 
(the energy data provider) and other international 
partners that receive statistical information (such 
as EUROSTAT and the World Bank) to further 
strengthen their institutional capacities for energy 
data processing and reporting.
Strengthening communication and co-operation 
among stakeholders
Co-operation and communication among all 
relevant actors can be further strengthened to 
ensure the exchange of updated information 
regarding the renewable energy sector’s evolution. 
This could ensure that challenges facing individual 
stakeholders are clearly communicated and 
collectively addressed. 
The Albanian Renewable Energy Association, due 
to the country’s history of hydropower production, 
has a stronger focus on hydro than non-hydro 
renewables. Non-hydro enterprises therefore need 
to take a more assertive role in communicating their 
operational challenges and, through the association, 
voice these challenges to relevant authorities who 
could take action to alleviate or resolve them. This 
can avoid information asymmetries and ensure 
better communication between the private and
public sectors.* The designation of Kosovo is without prejudice to positions on status and the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999).
1.1 COUNTRY OVERVIEW
The Republic of Albania is a coastal country in 
South East Europe, bordering Montenegro and 
Kosovo*
 to the north, North Macedonia to the east, 
Greece to the south, and the Adriatic and Ionian 
Seas to the west. Its capital, Tirana, is the largest 
city and the political and economic centre of the 
country. The second largest city is the port city of 
Durrës. 
The country is predominantly mountainous, with 
the more densely populated lowland coastal region 
spanning the western part of the country. Albania’s 
climate is typically Mediterranean with warm, dry 
summers and mild, wet winters. Average rainfall 
varies seasonally and across the country with 
about 95% of the annual precipitation occurring 
in the winter season, predominantly in the North 
Albanian Alps, while the southwestern part of 
the country commonly experiences droughts in 
the summer (Encyclopedia Britannica, 2020). 
According to a World Bank study, Albania is one 
of South East Europe’s most vulnerable countries 
to climate change. Changing weather patterns 
have already resulted in increased temperatures, 
decreased precipitation and more frequent 
extreme events such as floods and droughts 
(World Bank, 2013).
1. INTRODUCTION
Albania has a population of approximately 
2.9  million (INSTAT, 2019a). Tirana’s population 
of around 896 000 has doubled in the past three 
decades and amounts to almost a third of the 
country’s population. Durrës accommodates about 
10% of the population (INSTAT, 2019b). More than 
98% of the population aged 15 years and older is 
literate (UNESCO, 2018). In 2018, unemployment 
rates stood at just over 12% and were highest 
among young people (15-29  years; 23%)
(INSTAT, 2019c).
Albania has made significant economic progress 
during the past three decades, moving from 
a low-income economy to a middle-income 
country in Europe, with gross domestic product 
(GDP) per capita increasing from its lowest point 
of USD  200  (US dollars) in 1991 to USD  5 268 in 
2018 (World Bank and OECD, 2018a). The real 
annual GDP growth rate in 2018 was 4.15%, one 
of the highest in the South East European region
(INSTAT, 2019d). 
The structure of the Albanian economy has 
remained relatively unchanged over the past 
decade, with the services sector dominating, 
contributing to over half (54.1%) of the country’s 
gross value added in 2019. The industrial and 
agricultural sectors contributed 21.7% and 24.2%, respectively, in the same year (UNdata, 2020). 
Albania is a net importer of goods and services, 
although exports continue to rise and support 
economic growth. In 2018, Albania exported 
almost one-third (31.7%) of its GDP in goods and 
services (World Bank, 2019). 
However, energy imports place a considerable 
weight on economic growth and the country’s 
trade deficit, specifically in the energy sector. A 
drought in 2017 exposed the electricity sector’s
over-reliance on hydropower and resulted 
in electricity imports that cost the country 
USD  240  million and put public utilities in the 
power sector into severe financial difficulty. This 
expenditure reportedly forced the government to 
revise its budget to financially assist the imports 
and use emergency loans for power imports 
(Tirana Times, 2017). 
Strong and sustained economic growth is a main 
component of the country’s sustainable economic 
and social development agenda, and in nurturing 
this growth the energy sector plays an increasingly 
critical role. Establishing energy security, energy 
sector sustainability and an ensured energy 
supply at cost-competitive prices are some of
the key challenges for the country to address in the
near term.
1.2 RENEWABLES READINESS 
ASSESSMENT
In comparison with neighbouring countries in the 
South East Europe region, Albania’s energy mix 
has one of the highest shares of renewable energy. 
Ensuring a cost-competitive, secure energy supply 
in Albania can be achieved by further increasing 
the renewable energy share and diversifying the 
country’s electricity sector. 
The diversification of the country’s electricity 
sector is critical, as the current system is almost 
entirely hydro-based and thus susceptible to 
climatic variations. In recent years, the Albanian 
government has taken commendable steps for the 
promotion of non-hydro renewable energy use, 
and the Renewables Readiness Assessment (RRA) 
aims to further support the country on this path. 
The RRA is a tool developed by the International 
Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) to 
comprehensively evaluate the conditions for 
accelerated renewable energy deployment in 
a country. It is a country-led, multi-stakeholder 
consultative process which allows for the 
identification of existing challenges for renewable 
energy deployment and recommends short- to 
medium-term actions to guide decision makers 
and other stakeholders in addressing these
challenges.The RRA for Albania was initiated by the Ministry 
of Infrastructure and Energy (MIE) in technical cooperation with the International Renewable Energy 
Agency (IRENA) and has greatly benefitted from 
stakeholder inputs. Stakeholders in the RRA process 
included officials from ministries, transmission and 
distribution utilities, power project developers, 
development partners, financial institutions, civil 
society, and academia.
As a first step, a background report on Albania’s 
energy sector was developed along with an issue 
paper preliminarily highlighting challenges for 
renewable energy deployment. On this basis, an 
initial multi-stakeholder consultative workshop 
was organised by IRENA and the MIE in January 
2020 that facilitated further discussions on the 
challenges in renewable energy deployment and 
the identification of recommended actions in 
overcoming these challenges. The outcomes of the 
consultation workshop, along with insights gained 
from bilateral meetings with key stakeholders, 
constituted the basis for this RRA report.
The RRA, with its recommended short- to mediumterm actions, was validated in November 2020 at 
a virtual multi-stakeholder validation workshop 
attended by over 60 representatives from the 
energy sector in Albania.
This report calls for an accelerated diversification 
of the electricity sector in Albania and a focus on 
more non-hydro renewable energy development. 
In addition, end-use sectors are called on to 
incorporate more renewable-based energy supply 
and thereby take full advantage of the country’s 
renewable energy potential. In the immediate term, 
the RRA aims to inform the development of the 
National Energy and Climate Plan for 2021-2030 
and guide subsequent energy sector development 
to be conducive for renewables, energy security, 
environmental safeguarding and socio-economic 
benefits for all citizens.

2.1 ENERGY BALANCE
Albania’s primary energy production is dominated 
by fossil fuels  –  mainly crude oil  –  whose share 
has ranged between 46% and 68% over the last 
five years. Hydropower is the second largest 
contributor, with a share ranging from 20% to 
almost 40%, depending on annual rainfall (INSTAT, 
2020a). This vulnerability to climatic externalities 
for electricity production creates notable 
fluctuations in domestic energy production. For 
example, for the last five-year period, the lowest 
primary energy production was recorded in 2017, 
which was a particularly drought-stricken year, 
whereas the highest primary energy production 
was recorded in 2015  –  a year of considerable 
rainfall. Other domestic energy sources for primary 
energy production include biomass (including 
wastes, residues, non-food cellulosic material, and 
lignocellulosic material), lignite and natural gas. 
Because domestic energy production is not able to 
meet demand, Albania is on average a net energy 
importer. 
In 2018, Albania’s total primary energy supply 
(TPES)1
 amounted to 2 131  kilotonnes of oil 
equivalent (ktoe). Its share by energy source is 
represented in Figure 1. It remains predominantly 
fossil fuel based (68% composed of natural gas, oil 
and lignite), followed by electricity (24%), which is 
both produced from hydropower domestically and 
imported. Biomass and other energy sources (such 
as solar thermal) account for 8% of the TPES.
1 The total primary energy supply (TPES) is the sum of domestic energy production and imports minus exports and storage changes.
2. ENERGY SECTOR CONTEXT2.2 ELECTRICITY BALANCE AND 
INSTALLED CAPACITIES
Albania’s electricity demand grew rapidly in 1995-
2000. This was due to demographic, economic and 
social trends, including rural-to-urban migration, 
increased use of electricity for space heating and 
cooling, and rising living standards (IRENA, 2019). 
To meet the growing electricity demand, the 
country has increased its installed electric capacity 
over the past decade from 1 455 megawatts (MW) 
in 2007 to 2 204 MW in 2018. The majority of the 
installed capacity (1 448  MW) is owned by the 
Albanian Power Corporation (KESH), while private 
producers account for about a third of the installed 
capacity (755 MW) (ERE, 2019).
As shown in Figure 2, the Albanian power system 
is dominated by hydropower, representing 95% 
of the country’s installed capacity with a total of 
2 096  MW installed. The installed hydropower 
capacity comprises mainly large hydropower 
installations (i.e., above 10 MW in size) amounting 
to 1 904 MW, while small hydropower installations 
amount to 192 MW. The Drin River in northern 
Albania is the largest river in the country. It hosts 
three of the largest hydropower stations owned by 
KESH: Fierzë (500  MW), Komani (600  MW) and 
Vau I Dejës (250 MW), which are also referred to 
as the Drin River cascade. 
The country has a 98 MW fossil-fuel thermal 
power plant representing 4% of the total installed 
capacity that has not been put into use since its 
construction in 2011 due to a failure in its cooling 
system. In January 2019, the MIE issued a tender
for a public-private partnership (PPP) for a 
concession contract to revive the power plant, 
potentially converting it to a natural gas-fuelled 
plant to be supplied with gas from the planned 
Trans Adriatic Pipeline. The remaining 1% (10 MW) of 
installed capacity in 2018 comprised small-scale (i.e., 
each less than 2 MW) solar photovoltaic (PV) plants.
Albania’s domestic electricity production has 
fluctuated in recent years due to the electricity 
sector’s over-reliance on hydropower and annual 
precipitation. Figure  3 shows Albania’s domestic 
electricity production, consumption and net 
imports from 2014 to 2019. Despite the steady 
capacity additions over the years, domestic 
electricity production during the drought of 
2017 fell to 63% (4.5  terawatt hours [TWh]) 
of the previous year’s production (7.1  TWh).

Figure 2 Installed power capacity in 2018 (MW)
Source: EnC (2019)This forced the country to net import 39.2% 
of its electricity consumption in 2017 to meet 
demand. This signals the power sector’s extreme 
vulnerability to climatic changes and the urgent 
need to diversify away from hydropower to ensure 
energy supply security. The electricity system in 
Albania is also suffering from high losses. Although 
the country has taken measures to gradually 
reduce these losses over the past few years, they 
accounted for around 21.7% of the total electricity 
consumption in 2019 (INSTAT, 2020b). 
Figure  4a below shows net monthly domestic 
electricity production in 2018, compared to the 
average values for the same months over the 
ten-year period from 2007 to 2017. The difference 
between the months of lowest and highest electricity 
production, which in 2018 was three times the 
average difference of the ten years prior, is notable. 
This indicates increased seasonal variations of 
electricity production. Also notable is that, despite 
the additions in installed capacities, net domestic 
electricity production in October, November and 
December  2018 was below the ten-year average. 
This signals increasingly drier months of the last 
annual quarter and, despite additional hydropower 
capacities, an increasing inability to meet electricity 
demand in the second half of the year. 
Figure  4b shows that, when monthly electricity 
consumption profiles in 2018 are compared with the 
ten-year average, peak consumption months tend 
to be during the hottest and coldest months of the 
year due to electricity demand for space cooling 
and heating, respectively. In 2018, compared to 
the ten-year average, higher electricity demand 
is evident in the summer months, particularly in 
July and August, largely due space cooling. This 
is further compounded by the fact that electricity 
production decreases significantly from June 
onwards and is unable to meet domestic demand 
in the second half of the year. Thus, partially 
offsetting electricity demand for heating and 
cooling would allow for domestic production to 
better meet demand from June to December.

Albania is a net energy importer. Between 2014 
and 2018, the amount of net energy imported 
ranged from a low of 12% of the TPES in 2015 to a 
high of 46% in 2017. 
Net energy imports are directly correlated to 
annual rainfall, given that the electricity sector is 
almost entirely reliant on hydropower production. 
In 2017, a year of low rainfall, the country net 
imported 39.2% (2 915  GWh) of its electricity 
consumption.
A further contributor to net energy imports is the 
country’s rising demand for petroleum products, 
largely fuelling the transport sector. Although 
Albania is the largest producer and exporter of oil 
in the South East Europe region, most oil extracted 
in Albania is exported as unrefined crude oil.
As such, the country imports all of its refined 
petroleum products to meet its transport energy 
demand, which inevitably widens the country’s 
trade gap. Greening the transport sector by taking 
up biofuels blending and introducing electric 
mobility could lower the country’s energy imports 
and positively contribute to the national economy.
2.4 ENERGY CONSUMPTION BY SECTOR
The largest energy consumer in Albania is 
the transport sector, whose share has almost 
quadrupled since 1990 and amounted to 40% of 
final energy consumption in 2018. The residential 
sector was the second largest (24%, 490  ktoe), 
followed by the industrial sector (20%, 418 ktoe) 
(EUROSTAT, 2019a) (INSTAT, 2020a). 
The transport sector’s energy demands are mostly 
met by oil and to a lesser extent by biofuels (87.9 ktoe, 
13.4% in 2017) (MIE, 2018a). However, no system is 
in place to guarantee the sustainability of the used 
biofuels (IRENA, 2019). The residential sector is the 
largest electricity-consuming sector, consuming 57% 
of total electricity consumption (excluding losses) 
in 2018 (MIE, 2019). As such, the residential sector’s 
energy demands are predominantly met by electricity 
(51.2% in 2017) (EUROSTAT, 2019b), and to a lesser 
extent by biomass, solar thermal and petroleum 
products. A greater portion of this electricity 
consumption is due to high electricity demand for 
space heating and cooling and water heating. Almost 
half of space heating and water heating demand in 
the residential sector is met by electricity (43.6% and 
49.7%, respectively) (EUROSTAT, 2019c).

Source: INSTAT (2020a)Notably, over 70% of hot water demand in the 
household and services sector is supplied by 
electric boilers (UNDP, 2017). The demand for 
electricity for heating needs is especially high in 
times of low electricity production towards the 
end of the year (Figure 4a).
2.5 ENERGY DEMAND OUTLOOK
Within the National Energy Sector Strategy 2030, 
an analysis of energy development scenarios 
revealed that, given past growth trends and under 
a business-as-usual scenario, the annual energy 
demand in Albania is expected to increase by 77% 
in 2030 compared to 2018 levels (MIE, 2018b). The 
transport sector is forecast to continue to be the 
largest energy consumer over the next decade, 
contributing to continued net energy imports. 
The second-largest energy consumer will be the 
residential sector, followed by the industrial and 
services sectors. The highest increase in energy 
demand will be seen in the services sector.
Regarding the power sector, in part due to increasing 
climatic changes with more seasonal variations 
and rising temperatures in the summer months, 
electricity demand is forecast to increasingly spike 
in the hottest months as electricity demand for 
space cooling increases (ERE, 2019).
2.6 GRID INFRASTRUCTURE
The Albanian transmission grid is managed by the 
transmission system operator (OST) and is 
composed of 400 kilovolt (kV), 220 kV, 150 kV and 
110  kV transmission lines and 15 substations of 
4 096 megavolt amperes (MVA) installed capacity. 
Albania’s electricity system is interconnected 
through six lines with neighbouring countries. The 
three 400  kV lines are interconnectors to 
neighbouring Greece (Zemblak  –  Kardia), 
Montenegro (Tirana  2  –  Podgorica) and Kosovo* 
(Tirana 2 – Kosovo B). Two 220 kV lines connect to 
Montenegro (Koplik  –  Podgorica) and Kosovo* 
(Fierze – Pristina), and one 150 kV line connects to 
Greece (Bistrica 1 – Igumenice). 
More than 70% (1 539  MW) of the country’s 
installed power capacity – and the largest power

network. This supplies the major demand centres 
of Tirana, Elbasan, Durrës and Fieri and connects 
to the 110  kV network, which is predominantly 
ringed and to a lesser extent radial, covering all 
urban centres of the country and supplying the 
distribution network. About 20% (411 MW) of the 
installed generation capacity is connected to the 
110 kV network, whereas around 10% (237 MW) is 
connected to the distribution grid of 35 kV and less 
(ERE, 2019). The distribution network is operated 
by the distribution system operator (OSHEE).
Grid losses account for a large share of electricity 
consumed. In 2019, these stood at just over a fifth 
(21.7%) of final electricity consumption (INSTAT, 
2020b). On the transmission network, losses stand 
at around 2% and are largely dependent on the 
performance of the hydropower plants (HPPs) on 
the Drin River cascade (OST, 2018). The majority 
of the losses are on the distribution network and 
largely include technical losses due to inadequate 
upgrading of the distribution infrastructure. 
The 45 000 km of distribution network is aged, 
and 82% of the network is composed mostly 
of overhead cable lines, which contributes to 
electricity losses. Of the 178 substations, 40% 
have been in operation for more than 70 years. 
These are operated manually with limited
real-time information and no forecasting demand. 
The distribution grid is overloaded, especially in 
high demand centres such as Tirana and Durrës
(Lika, 2020).

Source: INSTAT (2020b)The injection of variable renewable energy poses 
major challenges in Albania, particularly to the 
distribution grid, as there is currently limited 
capacity for the distribution grid to accommodate 
this. According to a study done by OSHEE, the 
injection of small hydropower generation in the 
east of the country can increase distribution losses 
to as high as 40% (compared to 15% losses with no 
hydropower injection). 
Most of Albania’s electricity consumption occurs 
in the western part of the country. The eastern 
part consumes around 35% but nevertheless hosts 
most of the hydropower generation potential. 
Such power evacuation suffers losses and poses 
challenges to the current grid. A shift towards 
non-hydro-based renewable generation close 
to demand centres would be advantageous in 
continued power sector development. 
An immediate priority of OSHEE is to plan for 
an active grid that can allow for electricity flow 
bidirectionally, accommodate renewable energy 
prosumers and focus on grid upgrades close to 
renewable energy generation zones. Furthermore, 
a priority for grid refurbishment is around 
Tirana and Durrës, which account for 50% of the 
country’s electricity consumption. According 
to OSHEE’s estimates, investments worth 
EUR 40 (Euros) million to EUR 80 million (about 
USD  48  million to USD  96  million) are required 
to refurbish the distribution network to better 
handle variable renewable energy injection in the 
immediate term (Lika, 2020).
Nevertheless, electricity losses, although still high, 
have decreased steadily over the last five years, 
with gradual and ongoing improvements in grid 
infrastructure.
A 400  kV interconnection line is planned 
to connect Albania to Northern Macedonia 
(Fier  –  Elbasan  –  Bitola), which is anticipated 
to further reduce transmission losses, improve 
network capacity to facilitate new generation 
connections, improve the reliability of the regional 
network and support the development of the 
regional market in South East Europe. The line is 
under construction and is expected to be in place 
by the end of 2021. Another crucial development to 
reduce transmission network losses and improve 
the supply of electricity of Durrës, Kavaja and the 
southern part of Albania is the anticipated 220 kV 
double circuit line between Tirana and Rrashbull. 
A new 400/110 kV substation in Tirana, planned to 
be constructed by the end of 2021, will also ensure 
a more reliable supply of power for the Tirana area, 
which is the largest demand centre in the country.

The energy sector in Albania has a well-defined 
set of institutions with clear responsibilities in 
governing, regulating, operating and participating 
in the sector.
The Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy (MIE) is 
responsible for the energy sector and is designated 
to prepare, periodically review and update 
the National Energy Strategy; develop energy 
policies and mid-term and long-term strategies 
for the energy sector; develop market reforms 
in the sector to meet the national objectives and 
comply with European Union (EU) directives; 
formulate adequate legal framework; and promote 
energy efficiency, renewable energy resources 
and investments in the sector through enabling 
investment environments.
MIE is also responsible for granting authorisation 
and concession rights for the construction of 
power plants in Albania. Concessions are approved 
by the Council of Ministers and undersigned by 
the energy minister on behalf of the contracting 
authority.
The National Agency of Natural Resources 
(AKBN) is under the supervision of MIE, and is 
designated for the development and supervision of 
rational use of natural resources, according to the 
policies of the government. The agency monitors 
the sustainable use and rehabilitation of natural 
resources in mines, hydrocarbons and energy. In 
addition, AKBN carries out analytical and technical 
examinations of studies and projects; monitors the 
implementation and operation of projects, such 
as concessionary contracts for hydropower; and 
compiles and publishes annual energy balance 
sheets at the national and regional levels in 
compliance with Eurostat and international energy 
agency formats. AKBN provides energy data to 
the National Institute of Statistics (INSTAT).
The Energy Efficiency Agency is state-funded, 
reports to the MIE and is responsible for the 
preparation and monitoring of the implementation 
of the National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency, 
along with monitoring the implementation of 
energy efficiency programmes in residential and 
institutional building sectors, transport, industry, 
and agriculture. The agency also undertakes 
energy audits, provides certifications for energy 
auditors and advises on the preparation of bylaws 
that promote energy efficiency. 
The Ministry of Tourism and Environment 
is responsible for environmental protection; 
safeguarding of protected areas, forests and 
biodiversity; and climate change. The ministry 
is responsible for approving the strategic 
environmental assessments for any territorial or 
sector-based plan approved under the law on 
planning and development.
The ministry is the co-ordinator of the interministerial body on climate change and nationally 
determined contributions (NDCs) and the focal 
point for the implementation of the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change. 
The National Environmental Agency functions 
under the institutional framework of the Ministry 
of Tourism and Environment and is responsible for 
reviewing the environmental impact assessment 
(EIA) process for projects under Law No. 10 440 on 
“Environmental impact assessment”. According to 
this law, all power projects including transmission 
and distribution require an EIA prior to being 
granted a construction permit. However, small 
renewable power plants are only initially subjected 
to a preliminary EIA which, upon review, the agency 
may decide to further subject to an in-depth EIA.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development 
and Water Administration includes a national 
Directorate for Administration of Water Resources 
that oversees the sustainable management 
of irrigation, drainage and flood protection; 
improvement of the efficiency of water resources; 
reduction of the risks of dam destructions; and 
management of river and sea flooding. The ministry 
issues all water use permits for hydropower 
generation projects. 
The Energy Regulatory Authority (ERE) is an 
independent public body whose responsibilities 
include regulating activities in the electricity and 
natural gas sectors, developing and adopting 
electricity market rules while also monitoring all 
electricity market operations in Albania. ERE issues 
licenses for electricity generation, transmission, distribution, supply and trade. Electricity producers 
in Albania receive their approval of the grid codes 
by ERE for their operations and connections to 
the transmission and distribution networks. The 
authority adopts electricity tariffs, including feedin tariffs (FiTs), to all eligible electricity producers 
from renewable sources. ERE also defines the 
standard purchase agreements of these producers.
The Transmission System Operator (OST) performs 
the roles of the transmission network operator, 
power system operator and market operator. 
OST’s role is to provide the necessary transmission 
capacities for uninterrupted supply of electricity 
to end users, for the transmission of electricity 
generated from domestic sources, as well as for the 
transit and exchanges with other countries in the 
region through the European Network Transmission 
System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E). It 
also co-ordinates the development of network 
interconnections with neighbouring countries, 
dispatches power system facilities, manages power 
flows, acquires and utilises ancillary services if 
necessary, and co-ordinates parallel operation with 
other systems.
In accordance with the 2019 Electricity Sector Law, 
OST has taken gradual steps in the creation of a 
competitive free market for electricity in Albania, in 
compliance with Energy Community Secretariat 
(EnC) obligations and EU Energy Acquis. As such, it 
has spun-off the electricity market operator,
Albania Power Exchange (ALPEX), which was 
registered on 23 October 2020. ALPEX is a standalone independent company owned by OST and the 
Kosovo*
 transmission system operator, KOSST 
(57.25% and 42.75%, respectively). It will operate 
the Day-Ahead and Intra-Day markets of both 
Albania and Kosovo.*
The Albanian Power Corporation (KESH) is both 
a public electricity generation company and the 
largest producer of electricity in Albania. KESH 
administers and controls the Drin River cascade of 
HPPs (Fierzë, Komani and Vau I Dejës) with total 
installed power of 1 350  MW. The corporation is 
undergoing a progressive transformation from a 
monopoly into one of the country’s largest power 
generation companies operating in a liberalised 
market.
The Electricity Distribution System Operator 
(OSHEE) is responsible for the maintenance and 
operation of the distribution system below 35 kV 
and provides electricity supply to all consumers 
connected to its network. The operator is obliged 
to connect all consumers and/or producers to 
the distribution system in a transparent and nondiscriminatory way. In March 2018, OSHEE was 
unbundled, establishing three new companies: 
the Universal Service Supplier, the Free Market 
Supplier and the Distribution System Operator. 
Distributed power producers sell their power to 
the Free Market Supplier.

DEVELOPMENT
Albania is endowed with valuable natural resources, 
including abundant renewable energy potential. 
Hydro
Hydropower dominates Albania’s 
electricity sector with 2 096  MW of 
installed capacity at the end of 2018, 
representing 95% of total installed 
power generation capacity.
The River Drin alone generates about 90% of 
Albania’s domestic electricity supply. Of the 
total installed hydro capacity, large hydro power 
plants (more than 10 MW) account for 1 904 MW, 
while small hydro power plants (less than 10 MW) 
account for 192 MW (EnC, 2019). 
As of 2018, the total installed capacity of 
hydropower amounted to just under half (47%) of 
estimated hydro potential capacity. According to 
AKBN’s estimates, total hydro potential capacity 
is estimated at 4 500  MW, with an estimated 
annual output potential of up to 18 TWh (National 
Agency of Natural Resources of Albania, 2019). 
However, climate change is already having an 
adverse effect on hydropower production, which 
is likely to continue in the future. By 2050, annual 
average electricity output from Albania’s large 
HPPs could decrease by about 15% and from small 
HPPs by around 20% compared to 2010 levels 
(Ebiger, 2010). IRENA’s 2020 study for the South 
East Europe region, Renewable energy prospects 
for Central and South-Eastern Europe energy 
connectivity (CESEC),  estimates that in fulfilling 
an overall 48% renewable energy share of the

OVERVIEW
IRENA’s Renewable energy prospects for Central and South-Eastern Europe energy connectivity 
(CESEC) estimates the potential for an accelerated renewable energy scenario beyond current trends 
and policies, by 2030. The analysis covers all aspects of the energy system, including energy supply 
(both power and district heat generation) as well as energy supply in key sectors such as residential, 
industry and transport. It focuses on possible technology pathways, assessing technology, sector 
and system costs; investment needs; externalities relating to air pollution and climate; carbon dioxide 
(CO2
) emissions; and economic indicators such as employment and economic growth to derive a 
scenario of renewable energy options, per technology, which could be deployed by 2030.

capacity of hydro by 2030 is targeted at 2 150 MW. 
In other words, no further hydropower capacities 
are proposed by 2030 in addition to existing plans.
However, by the end of 2018, a total of 185
concession contracts were signed for the 
construction of 525 small HPPs nationwide. 
Of these, 165 are in production, 316 are under 
construction and the rest are obtaining the 
necessary permits (MIE, 2019). By the end of 
2020, 184 MW of hydropower capacity was added 
with the commissioning of the newly constructed 
Moglica HPP. This is the largest independent power 
producer plant in Albania (Cela, 2020).
Solar
At the end of 2018, 10  MW of solar 
PV was connected to the grid (EnC, 
2019). According to the MIE, since the 
introduction of the solar FiT support 
scheme, 88 applications for the construction of 
solar PV plants of up to 2 MW have been received, 
and 12 of the applications have been authorised for 
construction, which amount to a total capacity of 
24 MW. 
Following the first auction for solar PV, in November 
2018, 50  MW of solar PV was approved for 
construction under a Contract for Difference (CfD) 
support scheme. An additional 50 MW will be built 
by the same developer without a support measure 
(MIE, 2019). However, the power purchase 
agreement (PPA) for this project has not been 
signed. Following another auction round in January 
2020, a further 140  MW of solar will be built in 
Karavasta, near the city of Fier, of which 70 MW 
will be supported through a PPA with the off-taker 
at EUR 24.89/MWh (USD 29.37/MWh),
2
 while the 
rest will be sold at market price. Subsequently, the 
PPA for this project was signed in November 2020. 
The latest auction bidding round was launched at 
the end of 2020 for the construction of a 100 MW 
solar PV plant in Durrës with a price ceiling of 
EUR 55/MWh (USD 64.9/MWh).2
Estimated solar thermal installations in Albania 
amounted to 176 000  square metres (m2
) of 
solar water heating capacity, which is equivalent

to 123  MW of nominal thermal capacity, by the 
end of 2015 (UNDP, 2017), the most recent official 
documentation of the installed capacities. Of this 
installed capacity, 90% are flat-plate collector 
systems, while 10% are evacuated tube collectors. 
As shown in Figure 8a, Albania has outstanding solar 
insolation within most of its territory at more than 
1 500 kWh/m2
 annually, with highs of 1 753 kWh/m2
annually, particularly in the western part of the 
country. The country has some of Europe’s highest 
number of sunshine hours per year, presenting 
significant potential for development of solar PV 
for power generation and solar thermal for heating 
purposes. On average, the country enjoys 220 
sunshine days, or 2 700 hours of sunshine per year. 
According to IRENA’s study on the cost-competitive 
renewable energy potential in South East Europe, 
Albania’s technical potential for the deployment of 
solar PV is estimated at 2 378 MW, with production 
of 3 706  GWh annually (IRENA, 2017a). IRENA’s 
CESEC study proposes in its REmap scenario a 
solar PV installed capacity of 1 074 MW by 2030, 
with annual generation potential of 1 697  GWh. 
Figure  8b shows suitable areas for solar PV 
development and highlights zones of highest 
potential for development in Albania. These zones 
are assessed by combining resource potential 
with protected areas, land use, topography, 
population growth and proximity to transmission 
lines and are ranked by scores between 0% and 
100% – identifying the degree of the feasibility of 
an area to host a utility-scale solar PV project.
With regard to solar thermal, a study undertaken 
by the United Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP)/Global Environmental Facility (GEF) 
Solar Water Heating (SWH) project estimated 
that the potential for installing SWH systems in 
public buildings alone amounts to 200 000 m2
 of 
collector area. Such installations would collectively 
correspond to some 100 GWh of electricity savings 
per year, which would otherwise have been used 
for the buildings’ various sanitary hot water 
needs (UNDP, 2017). SWH systems have immense 
potential to alleviate increased electricity demand 
for water heating, especially in the peak summer 
months.< = 1 100

Albania currently has no installed wind 
power plants. However, according to the 
MIE, since the introduction of the wind 
FiT support scheme, 70 applications 
for the construction of wind plants up to 3  MW 
have been received. Of these, three have been 
authorised for construction with a total capacity 
of 9 MW which qualify for FiT support (MIE, 2019). 
At the end of 2020, a 150  MW wind tender was 
launched, restricted to projects with a minimum 
capacity of 30 MW and a maximum capacity of 
75 MW. Each successful bidder will sign a 15-year 
PPA for the sale of 100% of electricity generated 
through the CfD support mechanism (MIE, 2020).
As shown in Figure  9a, annual average wind 
speeds in Albania range between 3.3 metres per 
second (m/s) and 9.6  m/s. The most suitable 
areas for wind power production, with capacity 
factors typically varying from 22% to 25%, have 
annual average values ranging between 5.8  m/s 
and 7  m/s. According to IRENA’s estimates, 
Albania has a cost-competitive wind potential 
of up to 7 400  MW under the low-cost capital 
scenario3
 (IRENA, 2017a). IRENA’s CESEC study 
proposes in its REmap scenario a wind installed 
capacity of 616  MW by 2030, with an annual 
generation potential of up to 1 794 GWh (IRENA, 
2020a). Figure  9b shows suitable areas for wind 
development and highlights zones of highest 
potential for development in Albania. These zones 
are assessed by combining resource potential 
with protected areas, land use, topography, 
population growth and proximity to transmission 
lines and are ranked by scores between 0% and 
100% – identifying the degree of the feasibility of 
an area to host a utility-scale wind plant project. 
According to IRENA’s assessments, the highest 
potential zones for wind power development are 
in the south and north of the country.
In 2017, IRENA, together with the Joanneum Research Institute 
in Graz and the Faculty of Engineering at the University of 
Ljubljana, undertook a study, Cost-competitive renewable power
generation: Potential across South East Europe. The study carried 
out a systematic assessment of the overall renewable power potential 
in the South East Europe countries that are Contracting Parties to the 
Energy Community Treaty. The assessment included the potential 
for hydropower, wind, solar PV, geothermal and biomass resources. 
The publication’s aim is to inform the region regarding the potential 
and costs for developing renewable energy options.

Albania is in the very early stages of 
geothermal assessment. However, 
similar to other South East European 
countries, low-enthalpy geothermal 
energy resources are available in Albania. 
Maximum temperatures of up to 80°C (degrees 
Celsius) can be found in the south of the country 
bordering Greece and in the northeast. The 
majority of Albania’s geothermal resources are 
located in the Kruja Geothermal Area, which 
extends from the Adriatic Sea in the north of 
Albania and runs in a southeastern direction 
through the country towards the Konitza area in 
Greece. Within this zone in carbonate reservoirs 
lies an estimated geothermal energy potential of 
5.9x108-5.1x109
 gigajoules (Frasheri, 2015). Due to 
the low-enthalpy resource, geothermal potential 
for power production is not likely and would mostly 
be exploited in heating applications. 
Biomass
Albania’s biomass use is largely firewood 
utilised for various heating applications. 
For the production of biofuels, Albania 
has an operating plant that has total 
capacity to produce 100 kilotonnes (approximately 
112 million litres) of biofuels annually. According to 
some estimates, this plant can produce close to the 
10% biofuel blending targets by volume if operated 
at full capacity. However, this plant operates at
10-15% of full capacity on average (Karakaci, 2016).
According to IRENA’s CESEC study, biogas and 
biomass power production could reach 86  MW 
(495  GWh annually) by 2030, while liquid biofuels 
are estimated to be able to meet 8% (4 petajoules) of 
the transport fuel demands by 2030 (IRENA, 2020a).
3.2 POLICIES AND REGULATION
As a Contracting Party of the Energy Community 
Treaty, Albania is obligated to transpose and 
implement the EU Directive 2009/28/EC “On the 
promotion of the use of energy from renewable 
sources”. In 2017, Albania adopted Law 7/2017 
on Renewable Energy, partially transposing the 
EU directive. The law sets out the adoption of the 
National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP), 
which, among others, sets forth the targets for 
the share of renewable energy in the total energy 
consumption of the country, including electricity, 
transport, and heating and cooling. Furthermore, 
it stipulates policies and support measures for the 
achievement of such targets. NREAPs are updated 
every two years, and the latest was adopted in 
September 2019 as a consolidated Action Plan for 
the years 2019-2020. This action plan superseded 
the previous NREAP for 2018-2020 by reducing the 
targets for hydropower production and increasing 
targets for solar and wind in an effort to diversify 
the energy mix through penetration of wider 
renewable energy technologies. Going forward, 
the NREAP will be superseded by the National 
Energy and Climate Plan (NECP), which is still to 
be developed, and will set out renewable energy 
targets to 2030.
The NREAP 2019-2020 set an overall target of 
38% for the renewable energy share of final 
energy consumption by 2020. This overall target 
was forecast to be achieved with a total additional 
installed renewable power capacity of 738 MW, with 
the following technology-specific targets: 57 MW 
of hydropower, 490  MW of solar PV, 150  MW of 
wind and 41 MW of waste-to-power, which have not 
been achieved entirely. In the heating and cooling 
sector, no renewable energy deployment targets 
were set. In the transport sector, the NREAP aimed 
for 3% of energy consumption to be supplied by 
locally sourced biofuels, amounting to 20 ktoe in 
2020 (Government of Albania, 2019).
In relation to the transport sector’s energy 
supply, a law was introduced for the production, 
transportation and trade of biofuels and other 
renewable fuels for transport (Law 9876/2008). 
A law was also introduced to establish a binding 
biofuel blending target of 10% by volume of fuel 
oil consumed. This target is imposed on wholesale companies that trade oil by-products. The NREAP 
target thus falls short of the targets set out in 
legislation. Furthermore, sustainability criteria for 
the use of biomass and biofuel are still not in place.
In 2018, Albania adopted its National Energy 
Sector Strategy, which examined various energy 
development scenarios and set forth a series of key 
indicators and objectives that will shape Albanian’s 
energy sector over the period from 2018 to 2030 
(Table  2). Most notably, the strategy stipulated 
a 42% share of renewable energy in the TPES
by 2030.
In Albania, renewable energy sources are supported 
through the following support mechanisms (RES 
Legal, 2020).
► Feed-in tariffs
FiTs are provided to eligible small-scale renewable 
energy power plants which include wind energy 
plants up to 3 MW, HPPs up to 15 MW, and solar 
PV plants up to 2 MW. The unbundled subsidiary 
of the distribution system operator, OSHEE/
free market supplier (i.e., off-taker) is obliged to 
purchase renewable energy power generated by 
eligible power plants at a tariff set by the regulator 
and is granted for 15 years. The tariff is defined by 
the regulator by assuming a reasonable return on 
investment.
After technical and economic evaluation of 
the proposed power plants, EIAs, water usage 
permission (in case of hydro), and permissions 
from the transmission system operator and 
distribution system operator, the regulator grants 
the licence for power production. Once licenced, 
the renewable energy producer draws up a PPA 
with the off-taker. 
As discussed in Chapter  3, Section 1, since 
the introduction of the FiT schemes, 12 of 88 
applications for the construction of solar PV up 
to 2  MW have been authorised for construction, 
while 3 of 70 applications have been authorised 
for the construction of wind plants up to 3  MW 
(MIE, 2019). The main reason for the low success 
of applications is due to inadequate supporting 
documentation, such as insufficient technical and 
economic feasibility assessments.

Source: ERE (2019) ► Premium tariff/CfD
Larger renewable energy power plants whose 
installation capacities are above those set for FiT 
eligibility are eligible for a premium tariff or CfD. 
The tariff is determined through competitive 
bidding/auction. The auction terms and conditions 
are approved by the Council of Ministers, who may 
choose to limit certain technologies in the tender 
due to criteria such as network connection costs 
or resource diversification. According to the 2017 
renewable energy law, the CfD is foreseen to have 
a duration of 15 years. Producers will be able to 
sell the electricity in the market and receive the 
variable difference between the auction price and 
the electricity market price (currently based on the 
Hungarian power exchange price) as a support 
measure. An important detail to underline is that 
if prices in the electricity market go up and are 
higher than the auction price, renewable power 
producers will be obliged to bear the difference. 
Albania was one of the first countries in the 
South East European region to hold an auction 
for renewable energy producers. As discussed 
in Chapter  3, Section 1, the first auction bidding 
round was launched in 2018 whereby the winning 
bidder was to construct a 100 MW solar PV plant. 
Half of the plant’s generation would be eligible 
for a 15-year CfD tariff of EUR  59.9 per MWh
(~USD 70.68 per MWh), and the other half would 
be sold at market price. The second auction 
bidding round was launched in 2020 for a 140 MW 
solar PV plant in Karavasta, whereby half of the 
installed capacity would be eligible for a CfD tariff 
of EUR 24.89 per MWh (~USD 29.37 per MWh), as 
determined by the winning bidder, and the rest 
would be sold at market price (PV Magazine, 2020). 
The latest auction bidding round was launched at 
the end of 2020 for the construction of a 100 MW 
solar PV plant in Durrës, of which 70 MW will be 
eligible for CfD with a price ceiling of EUR 55 per 
MWh (~USD 64.9 per MWh).
► Net-metering scheme
Private households and small and medium-sized 
enterprises with wind and solar installations of 
up to 500  kW are eligible to net-meter their 
renewable energy production with their electricity 
consumption. The metering is done on a monthly 
basis and surplus electricity can be sold to the 
service provider and remunerated according to a 
price set by the regulator. The Albanian government 
expects this programme to enable the deployment 
of 200  MW of PV over an unspecified period of 
time (PV Magazine, 2019).
► Customs and excise tax exemptions
Machinery and equipment used for the 
construction of energy power plants (nonrenewable and renewable energy technologies) 
are exempted from custom duties. The fuels used 
by electricity producers are also eligible for excise 
tax exemption. However, a tax exemption does not 
apply for solar thermal systems or for renewable 
energy measuring equipment such as wind masts. 
Furthermore, a 20% value-added tax (VAT) is 
applied on all equipment, machinery and fuels, 
except in cases of imported solar PV machinery and 
equipment valued above ALL 50 million (Albanian 
lek; USD 487000) and for project capacities above 
500 kW (Deloitte, 2018).
3.3 ECONOMICS OF RENEWABLES
In Albania, renewable energy incentives such 
as the fixed tariffs for renewable electricity sale
(i.e., the difference between the market price and 
FiT or the CfD) are borne by electricity consumers 
through a renewable energy levy within the 
consumer electricity tariff. Notably, this obligation 
is borne exclusively by consumers connected to 
the distribution grid. As such, end-consumers 
connected directly to the transmission system, 
such as large industries, do not contribute. Tax 
breaks on renewable energy equipment are borne 
directly by the state.
Albania offers one of the lowest levelised cost of 
electricity (LCOE) of hydropower in the South East 
Europe region, starting from an average of EUR 35/
MWh (USD 41.3/MWh) (IRENA, 2017a). The LCOE 
for non-hydro renewable energy power generation 
is highly sensitive to the cost of capital, specifically 
the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). This 
depends on factors such as type of technology, 
place of investment, type of investor, whether 
concessional instead of commercial loans are used, 
risk profile and general economic conditions in 
the country. The role of financial institutions that 
provide preferential loans is effectively important in renewable investments and driving down the cost 
of capital. Nonetheless, in a relatively conservative 
scenario with a 10% WACC, Albania’s solar PV 
generation potential is one of the region’s most 
cost-effective. According to IRENA’s 2017 study 
Cost-competitive renewable power generation: 
Potential across South East Europe, the average 
LCOE for solar PV in Albania was estimated to 
reach less than EUR  50/MWh (USD  59/MWh)
by 2050 (IRENA, 2017a). The accelerated 
decrease in PV technology costs is already 
apparent, with the latest auction round bidding 
in Albania at EUR 24.89/MWh (USD 29.37/MWh).
Similarly, for wind, and as depicted in Figure  10 
below, LCOE can reach well below EUR 50/MWh 
(USD 59/MWh) by 2030. Due to Albania’s limited 
biomass and geothermal potential for power 
generation, these technologies are not considered 
cost-effective for power development and would 
be more suitable for thermal applications.

(using “medium” cost of capital: 10% WACC)
Source: IRENA (2017a)Data in the IRENA Auction and PPA Database indicate that solar PV projects that have won recent auction and 
PPA processes – and that will be commissioned in 2021 – could have an average price of around USD 0.039/kWh 
globally. This represents a 42% reduction compared to the global weighted-average LCOE of solar PV in 2019 and 
is more than one-fifth less than the cheapest fossil-fuel competitor, namely coal-fired plants. The auction and PPA 
data indicate the average global price of electricity from onshore wind could fall to USD 0.043/kWh by 2021, down 
18% from 2019. Offshore wind and concentrating solar power projects, meanwhile, are set for a step change, with 
their global average auction prices set to fall 29% and 59% from 2019 values, respectively. With its longer lead 
times, offshore wind is expected to fall to a global average of USD 0.082/kWh in 2023 (IRENA, 2020b).

Albania is one of the most vulnerable countries 
to climate change in the South East European 
region. Changing weather patterns have already 
resulted in increased temperatures, decreased 
precipitation, and more frequent extreme events 
such as floods and droughts (World Bank, 2013). 
Compared to 2019 levels, a decrease in annual 
precipitation of 2.6% to 3.4% is expected by 2025 
and of up to 6.3% by 2050. The greatest decrease 
in precipitation is expected during summer, with 
a 11.5% decrease by 2025 and a 23.2% decrease 
by 2050 (World Bank, 2020a). Given that Albania’s 
electricity system is largely reliant on hydropower 
production, decreased precipitation levels will 
adversely affect the generation output of existing 
HPP installed capacities, especially in the summer 
months. Compared to 2010 levels, by 2050 a 15% 
decrease may be expected in the average annual 
electricity generation from existing large HPPs, 
while small HPPs are expected to have a 20% 
decrease in generation output (Ebiger, 2010).
Furthermore, compared to current levels, mean 
annual temperatures across the country are 
expected to rise by 1°C by 2025 and by 2.5°C 
by 2050. In the summer months, the number of 
very hot days (over 35°C) is expected to increase 
by up to two days per year by 2025 (World 
Bank, 2020a). As discussed in Chapter  2, due to 
current rising temperatures, increasing demand 
for cooling during the hottest summer months is 
already increasing power demand, and this trend 
is expected to continue. Given that hydropower 
production in the summer months significantly 
declines, the potential role of non-hydro power 
renewable energy technologies is critical – 
especially that of solar PV, which benefits from 
the greatest production in summer months and 
during the times of day when the greatest demand 
for cooling occurs. Thus, investing in climateresilient renewable energy technologies for power 
production is imperative in sustainably meeting 
the demand of the energy sector. Moreover, the 
adoption of renewable energy use, both in the 
energy as well as the transport sector, is a crucial 
component in achieving the targets of Albania’s 
NDCs, particularly as the transport sector is one of 
the country’s largest contributors to greenhouse 
gas emissions. Under the NDCs, the country has 
committed  to  reducing  CO2
  emissions  by  11.5%, 
compared to the baseline scenario,4 in the period 
2016 to 2030. This amounts to 708 kilotonnes of 
CO2
 emission reduction in 2030. 
4.2 SEASONAL VARIATION IN 
HYDROPOWER GENERATION
Hydropower generation in Albania is highly 
seasonally variable. The highest amounts of 
production occur in the winter season, when 
over 90% of the annual precipitation falls. During 
this period, on a monthly average, the country 
produces a surplus of electricity, which is exported. 
However, as of June, hydropower production 
drops significantly and struggles to meet demand, 
resulting in the need for electricity imports. 
In 2018, the highest power production month, 
March, produced five times more hydroelectricity 
than the lowest production month, November. 
This discrepancy has significantly increased over 
the past decade, when on average the highest 
production month was just over double the lowest 
production month. Furthermore, despite the 
additions of installed hydropower capacity, the 
electricity system is still not able to meet demand 
in the second half of the year, and the production 
level during the last quarter of the year in 2018 
4. RATIONALE FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY 
DEVELOPMENT
4 The baseline scenario of emissions projections is based on economic growth in the absence of climate change policies,
starting from 2016.was well below the average of the ten-year prior 
period. Thus, further hydropower installations 
without better hydro reservoir management and 
hydro risk-mitigation measures will not effectively 
meet Albania’s energy security objectives.
To significantly reduce this seasonal variation of 
power supply and reduce the need for imports in 
the future, non-hydro renewables such as wind 
and solar PV should be prioritised. This would 
enhance security of energy supply and reduce the 
electricity deficit, especially in the undersupplied 
second half of the year.
4.3 RISING DOMESTIC DEMAND AND
FUEL IMPORTS
Albania’s biggest energy imports are fossil fuels 
fuelling the transport sector’s energy demand. 
In 2018, imported petroleum fuel was the single 
biggest import expense, worth USD 190 290 million, 
making it a significant contributor to the country’s 
trade deficit (World Bank, 2020b). The transport 
sector’s energy demands have been rising, and the 
sector is projected to continue to be the largest 
energy consumer over the coming decades.
With this rising demand, given fluctuating oil 
prices and strong import dependence, a move 
towards greening the transport sector would 
provide a more economical and environmentally 
sound way to meet the sector’s energy demands. 
This could be achieved by incentivising the use of 
electric vehicles and enforcing mandatory biofuel 
blending. A prerequisite for biofuel blending is 
an established sustainability criteria that would 
ensure an environmentally sound use of biomass 
for energy. 
Furthermore, given that 41% of agricultural land in 
Albania lies fallow (Cela, 2018), inland potential for 
sustainable local production of biofuels is worth 
assessing. Developing this would benefit the 
local economy and reduce the need for imports. 
Additionally, electric mobility can support the 
electricity sector’s development through load 
peak shaving or load shifting, which offsets peak 
loads to off-peak hours and alleviates overloading 
of the grid. This in turn can reduce distribution 
power losses, increase distribution power quality 
and extend the lifetime of the power infrastructure, 
while also reducing power generation costs 
(Erdogan, Erden and Kisacikoglu, 2018).

RENEWABLE ENERGY
The deployment of renewable energy contributes 
to numerous socio-economic benefits for 
communities and countries, including employment, 
income generation, decreased air pollution, welfare 
improvements and local industrial development 
leading to increased GDP. According to IRENA’s 
analysis, a typical 50 MW solar PV project requires 
some 230 000 person days along the value chain, 
as shown in Figure  12 (IRENA, 2017b). Although 
some parts of the value chain are sourced from 
outside of the country or require a renewablesspecific trained and certified workforce, much 
of the workload  –  especially in transport and 
construction – can be filled locally by the workforce 
of existing industries, which can immediately 
contribute to local employment and income 
generation. With skilled local labour, specifically in 
operation and maintenance as well as installation, 
over 70% of the workforce can be sourced locally, 
further enhancing local economies. Similarly, a 
50  MW onshore wind farm requires 43% of its 
workforce for operation and maintenance, which 
can largely be locally sourced.
While manufacturing of solar PV and wind energy 
technology is concentrated in a limited number of 
countries, solar thermal technology manufacturing 
has gained momentum in Albania, with several 
companies manufacturing system components 
locally. Furthermore, such systems can have direct 
economic benefits on individual users as they 
offset their electricity consumption and reduce 
monthly electricity bills.

Electric vehicles as taxis in Tirana
Photograph: Lorenc GordaniIn Albania, a typical solar water heating (SWH) system with a collector area of 3-4m2, a 150-200 litre water tank and 
minimum operational lifetime of 15 years costs approximately USD 1 000, including installation. With 50% annual 
efficiency, such a system could provide up to 2 640 kWh/year in mountainous regions such as Peshkopia and up to 
3 600 kWh/year on the coastline in Saranda. An average household of four persons requires between 2 500 kWh 
and 3 000 kWh for hot water annually. This demand could be fully supplied by the solar water system for seven 
to eight months of the year, especially in the summer season, and may require minimal backup in colder months. 
Based on RETScreen*
 analysis for such a system, and provided it is well-dimensioned and installed, an approximate 
three-year payback period can be achieved based on electricity savings alone (UNDP, 2017). 
According to a market study undertaken by UNDP/GEF, close to 8 000 public buildings, including hospitals, 
schools, dormitories and others, have the potential to install SWH systems for various sanitary hot water needs. The 
potential for SWH installation in public buildings alone amounts to a collector area of approximately 200 000 m2
, 
corresponding to 100 GWh of electricity savings and some EUR 8 million (USD 9.6 million) annually (Rutanen, 2014).

AND PLANNING
Harnessing renewable energy resources for 
the development of the energy sector presents 
economic, social and environmental benefits, but it 
also poses various challenges for integration. These 
challenges stem chiefly from the spatial localisation 
to the sub-hourly, daily and seasonal variations of 
the resource. These specificities of renewable energy 
resource availability need to be well understood and 
assessed so that they can be adequately harnessed 
and integrated into the energy system.
Based on this resource assessment, appropriate 
planning is required prior to renewable resource 
exploitation and integration to allow for the 
continued optimal operation of the highly dynamic 
energy sector. In other words, particularly in the 
power sector, a well-assessed resource potential 
and timely planning for variable renewable power 
generation and grid infrastructure can minimise 
technical disturbances to the grid and increase 
the quality of energy supply while ensuring 
economic viability for the power producer, the 
system operators and the final consumers. 
Proactive planning, based on techno-economic 
resource potential, thus plays a crucial role in the 
development of a robust energy sector.
Action 1: Developing renewable energy zones
The availability of renewable energy resources in 
Albania for some renewable energy technologies 
is less studied than for others. Given the country’s 
hydropower history, hydropower potential has been 
the most analysed resource; however, only the main 
rivers have been studied to a greater degree. With 
the increasing climatic changes that have caused 
erratic hydropower generation in recent years, many 
of the studies that have been carried out are now 
outdated, and future projections of hydropower 
generation potential remain understudied. For solar 
and wind resources in Albania, economic potential 
analysis and zoning are lacking. This hinders policy 
development in setting achievable targets, the 
appropriate sizing of solar and wind auctions, and 
least-cost power system planning.
Renewable energy zones can be defined as areas 
of high-quality resource potential for power 
development whose exploitation is environmentally 
sound and technically and economically viable, and 
which can be prioritised for development. These
areas are also those that satisfy various 
criteria – such as proximity to existing or planned grid 
infrastructure, load centres, road networks, and other 
existing and planned generation projects  –  while 
avoiding environmentally protected areas or areas 
which for other reasons may not be acceptable 
for development. Such zones would inform policy 
makers in setting technology generation targets 
or auction sizing, and guide co-ordinated planning 
of generation and transmission infrastructure. 
Furthermore, renewable energy zones help to 
attract investments by guiding potential project 
developers to prioritised development areas, thus 
providing more visibility into and certainty about 
the development of the sector. This in turn reduces 
risks in project development, pre-development 
transaction costs and timeframes, and thereby the 
project costs.
As Albania focuses efforts on a more diversified 
power generation mix, zoning for solar PV and wind 
generation projects should be prioritised. Each 
zone’s attributes, such as annual generation potential 
and estimated LCOE production, can directly assist 
policy makers in the development of the national 
energy and climate plans. As a first step towards 
a complete zoning assessment, IRENA’s potential 
suitability analysis in Chapter  3, Section 1 of this 
report can be used as a basis. AKBN, as the institution 
in charge of gathering resource potential data, 
should lead the development of a renewable energy 
zoning study for solar and wind, in co-operation
with the MIE and development partners.
5. CHALLENGES AND
RECOMMENDATIONSAction 2: Developing a comprehensive
least-cost energy master plan
Effective energy planning is a way of aggregating 
various data pertaining to the energy sector and 
beyond, such as renewable energy zoning, energy 
resource potentials and historic statistical trends, 
along with other qualitative and quantitative 
information, into a clearly formulated and 
evidence-based energy development pathway.
A comprehensive plan allows for decision-making 
processes as well as guiding of the sector’s 
development in a coherent way. Furthermore, 
energy planning offers clarity and visibility for 
various energy stakeholders, including investors 
and development partners who then can focus 
their investments or programmes more effectively. 
Planning is thus crucial in avoiding piecemeal 
development approaches, ad-hoc decision making, 
and contradictory investments and development 
support.
Albania’s energy sector is guided by its National 
Energy Sector Strategy 2030, along with 
the National Renewable Energy Action Plan
2018-2020 and the Gas Master Plan. As much 
as these documents set out a framework with 
overall goals along with quantitative scenarios 
and targets for the energy mix, a holistic 
least-cost plan must be developed to aggregate 
subsectoral plans and assess the accompanying 
infrastructure needed to reach overall goals. 
Specifically, this plan should guide when, where 
and how investments in the energy sector should 
be made. 
These investments should include power 
generation capacities, co-ordinated distribution 
and transmission grid infrastructure developments, 
and other related developments such as electric 
mobility infrastructure or local biofuel production. 
This can then also allow for decisions made at the 
subsectoral level to be coherent with the overall 
system plans and ensure an integrated approach 
for energy sector development, which accounts 
for supply and demand of energy through a leastcost principle, and without endangering system 
stability or security. 
Furthermore, such an integrated plan will 
provide foresight into any accompanying policy 
and regulatory measures that need to be put in 
place or adapted to achieve the proposed plans 
according to timelines. The planning department 
of the MIE, along with the AKBN, are therefore 
encouraged to take the lead on development of 
a least-cost master plan for the Albanian energy 
sector.
Resource mapping is the first phase in formulating a cost-effective and renewable energy development. The 
subsequent phase is the identification of renewable energy resource areas, commonly known as zoning, with 
high potential for renewable energy development, reasonable proximity to the necessary infrastructure, and 
low environmental and social impacts. Such identification would enable generation and transmission expansion 
planning, which can reduce the risk of investing in renewable projects, support countries in making strategic 
decisions, and secure sustainable sources of electricity generation.
The suitability assessment is a geographic information system (GIS)-based multi-criteria decision-making process 
that aims to find highly suitable areas for a utility-scale power plant deployment in a country. These areas are 
assessed by combining renewable resources with protected areas, land use, topography, population growth, and 
proximity to transmission lines. The output of this assessment is a suitability index map – comprising scores between 
0% and 100% – identifying the degree of the feasibility of an area to host a solar or wind project.
For each resulting zone, potential capacity, annual energy generation and storage capacity are calculated. These 
zones are then ranked based on their corresponding surface, capacity factor, annual generation and distance to the 
grid to identify the most favourable zones for project development.

Box 3 IRENA’s tools and methodology for renewable energy zoningAction 3: Strengthening the distribution
network
As Albania moves towards a more diversified 
renewable energy mix in its power system, the 
distribution network will increasingly be the 
backbone and determining factor of the scale 
at which renewables are injected into the power 
system. The current state of the distribution 
network is not conducive for increased variable 
renewable energy generation injection. The grid 
suffers from overloading in high-demand centres, 
such as in Tirana, posing serious obstacles to the 
injection of distributed generation such as, for 
example, solar PV net-metering systems. Further 
plaguing the distribution grid are electricity losses, 
which amounted to 23.3% of electricity supply 
in 2018. According to distribution grid flexibility 
studies carried out by OSHEE, the injection of 
small hydropower alone can increase losses on the 
current system up to 40%. As the power sector 
works towards a more diversified generation mix, 
further injection of renewables will place an even 
greater strain on the grid unless immediate efforts 
are mobilised to fortify the distribution grid.
An immediate priority for OSHEE is the 
refurbishment of the distribution grid around the 
main load centres of Tirana and Durrës, which 
account for 50% of electricity consumption. 
Equally pertinent is planning for an active grid 
that can allow for electricity flow bidirectionally, 
accommodating renewable energy prosumers, 
and focusing on grid upgrades close to planned 
renewable energy generation zones so that power 
can be effectively evacuated to the demand 
centres. 
This upgrading should also include the provision 
of new equipment to ensure the safety of data, 
distributed monitoring equipment to collect 
information, and communication system overlay to 
deliver the operations data to OSHEE (Mantooth, 
2011). Carrying out further grid flexibility studies, 
particularly based on renewable energy zones 
and planned distributed generation projects, 
would additionally guide further prioritised grid 
strengthening needs in line with generation 
expansion. According to preliminary estimates, 
about EUR  40-80 million (USD  48-96 million) 
in investments is required to refurbish the 
distribution network to better handle variable 
renewable energy injection in the immediate term. 
Therefore, development partners active in the 
development of the energy sector in Albania are 
advised to focus available technical and financial 
resources to support OSHEE in its ongoing efforts 
in strengthening the distribution grid, particularly 
with regard to priority areas in the immediate term.
5.2 LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY 
FRAMEWORKS
The Renewable Energy Law in Albania has set out 
the legal framework to facilitate the wider use and 
deployment of renewables within the country’s 
energy system, thereby striving to achieve national 
targets for the share of renewables. This has seen 
the deployment of various renewable energy 
projects, increased investments and the setting up 
of various enterprises offering related services. In 
the immediate term, the development of renewable 
energy targets beyond 2020 is needed. Plans are 
already underway to develop the NECP, in which 
such targets will be defined up to 2030. Apart 
from target-setting, existing support mechanisms 
for renewable energy deployment are to be 
further strengthened, approval processes need to 
be streamlined, and a dedicated renewable energy 
agency should be established. Furthermore, 
legislative and regulatory frameworks must be 
reliable, transparent and credible, with changes 
announced in a timely manner for future projects, 
no unannounced changes for future projects and 
no retroactive changes.
Action 4: Strengthening support mechanisms 
for renewable energy deployment
Fiscal incentives  –  such as tax breaks, FiTs and 
premiums – comprise one of the main supporting 
mechanisms for attracting renewable energy 
investments. Although Albania has made 
progressive efforts in establishing various support 
incentives for the greater uptake of renewables, 
as discussed in Chapter 3, Section 3, these could 
be further strengthened. Namely, although 
import duties are waived for renewable energy 
equipment, VAT could be reduced to incentivise 
deployment. VAT is exempted in cases of imported 
solar PV machinery and equipment valued aboveALL  50 million (USD  487 000) and for project 
capacities above 500 kW (Deloitte, 2018). However, 
in the domestic sale of equipment, especially for 
systems below 500 kW, which are mainly used 
for residential and institutional power production 
and for all other renewable energy technologies, 
a full 20% VAT is applied. In reducing overall 
project costs for renewable energy investors, 
and indirectly the costs of electricity production 
and incentivised tariffs, a VAT reduction could be 
applied on all machinery and equipment related 
to all renewable energy technologies, including 
measurement equipment for assessing renewable 
energy potentials such as wind masts.
There is a need for an improved methodology 
for FiT calculation. Currently the support tariffs 
are calculated based on the Hungarian power
exchange (HUPEX) prices with added coefficients. 
However, in ensuring the optimal amount of 
incentivisation, a methodology is needed that 
would ensure market approach under the Albanian 
context and enable renewable power producers to 
steadily enter into the market in competitive terms 
at the end of the incentive scheme. 
Furthermore, because final electricity consumers 
contribute towards the financing of the FiT and 
CfD support schemes, only customers connected 
to the distribution system grid and who pay for 
their electricity consumption to the distribution 
system operator finance this contribution. Some 
10-12% of electricity consumers are bypassed from 
the renewable energy obligation, as they receive 
their electricity through bilateral contracts with 
the transmission system operator. 
In advancing the development of the sector, the 
renewable energy obligation would have to be 
embedded into electricity pricing for non-tariff 
consumers connected to the transmission system.
Additionally, there is a need for various permitting and 
approval processes for the generation of renewable 
power to be streamlined to shorten development 
timeframes, provide clarity and further incentivise 
investments. The private sector entities installing 
distributed renewable power systems in Albania 
often report that improvements should be made 
in the standardisation of application forms for grid 
connection approval, and that the duration for such 
approvals should be considerably shortened. Given 
that the private sector bears the risk of connection 
approval, prolonged duration times for approval affect 
the operations and finances of enterprises. Therefore, 
standardising approval processes for interconnection 
is particularly important for distributed generation, 
as this ensures that all systems that meet certain 
technical and safety requirements can connect to the 
distribution grid without unnecessary delay. 
Action 5: Establishing a dedicated renewable 
energy agency
Although envisaged in the Renewable Energy 
Law, Albania lacks a dedicated renewable energy 
agency to inform the co-ordinated development of 
renewables in line with national and international 
obligations. Furthermore, given the dynamic 
and fast-evolving renewable energy sector, 
such an entity could be tasked with informing 
the development of the energy sector based on 
evidence-based tracking of resource potentials, 
market trends and global best practices. The 
overall objective should aim at informing timely 
development of new infrastructure, human 
resources and legislation with a view to meeting 
future energy demands in a sustainable and leastcost development pathway for the country.
The establishment of such an agency would be 
an important step given the country’s aspirations 
to develop the energy sector to include a greater 
share of renewables. In fact, given the strong 
inter-linkages between energy efficiency and 
renewables, and to ensure operational cost 
effectiveness, such an agency could be merged 
with the existing Energy Efficiency Agency.
The activities of the renewable energy agency 
should be based on the envisaged mandate as 
stipulated within Article 7 of the Renewable 
Energy Law, and further include the following nonexhaustive list of duties:
• keeping an updated registry of renewable 
power producers and service providers, 
including certified human resources such as 
certified solar PV installers and energy auditors
• collaborating with vocational training centres 
and international partners on designing 
training, certifications and capacity building 
programmes in building a strong local human 
resource• tracking the energy balance contributions 
of all energy stakeholders, including power 
generation of power producers, numbers of 
installed distributed systems such as solar 
PV and solar thermal, disaggregated energy 
consumption data from all economic sectors 
such as households, transport, industry and 
agriculture, etc.
• drafting timely assessments of the share of 
renewables in the electricity, heating and 
cooling, and transport sectors to be shared 
with MIE, INSTAT and other international 
organisations
• monitoring the effectiveness and timely 
implementation of the NREAPs and potential 
energy sector master plans
• assessing gaps and challenges in the continued 
development of the sector and identifying 
priority areas of support in a timely manner
• studying market trends of renewables, global 
best practices and the effectiveness of 
implemented incentives and informing further 
regulatory and policy measures accordingly
• carrying out resource potential analysis and 
pre-feasibility studies for renewable energy 
resource development
• providing transparent information on renewable 
energy data, incentives and support measures, 
energy sector development plans, permitting 
procedures and other relevant information for 
the public and private sector.
In ensuring operational efficiencies, a funding 
stream must be developed for the agency, 
allowing for the bulk of the operational costs to 
be unconstrained by national treasury limitations 
or MIE budget allocation. For example, initial 
funding for the establishment and the first years 
of operation could be covered by development 
funds, while subsequent funding could potentially 
be provided from renewable energy contributions 
in consumer energy tariffs, taxes on fossil fuel use, 
as well as activities carried out within the entity’s 
competence, such as field measurements for prefeasibility studies. 
5.3 RENEWABLES IN END-USES
Albania’s path towards a more diversified energy 
mix requires an accelerated uptake of renewable 
energy in end-use sectors such as transport, and 
heating and cooling. The transport sector is the 
country’s largest energy consumer, consuming 
40% of the country’s primary energy supply, while 
heating and cooling demand constitutes a large 
share of the energy needs in the residential and 
service sectors. Currently, the transport sector 
is largely supplied with fossil fuels, while space 
heating and cooling, as well as water heating, are 
largely supplied with electricity and biomass. In 
ensuring further adoption of renewables in the 
end-use sectors beyond the 2020 horizon, actions 
are required in the formulation of coherent enduse strategies and achievable target-setting based 
on locally available resources.
Action 6: Developing a strategy for a greener 
transport sector
Greening the transport sector constitutes the 
uptake of biofuels blending and the introduction of 
electric mobility, both of which have the potential 
to offset the otherwise heavy fossil fuel use in the 
transport sector. 
E-mobility has the potential to positively contribute 
to the balancing of the power system through 
peak-load shaving, reducing distribution losses and 
reducing air pollution. Nevertheless, the uptake 
of electric vehicles in Albania is very low apart 
from a small number of privately owned electric 
vehicles and some electric fleets (taxis) in Tirana. 
This is likely due to the fact that there are currently 
no incentives or regulations that support their 
uptake. Another impeding factor is that the critical 
charging infrastructure for e-transport is scarcely 
available, and charging stations are mainly found 
in some places of central Tirana. There is therefore 
a need to incentivise the uptake of electric 
vehicles through import duty and tax exemptions, 
for example. There is also an urgent need to 
improve the charging infrastructure through the 
incentivisation of private sector investments. In 
reaping the full benefits of emobility, however, 
incentives are needed for active demand-side 
management, whereby the charging of vehicles 
is encouraged during low-peak hours of the day.An overall energy strategy aiming at the 
diversification of the transport sector should be 
developed as a cross-sectoral collaborative effort 
between the relevant public authority, which 
foresees a collaboration between MIE and ERE, to 
ensure a co-ordinated and coherent development 
pathway for both the energy and transport sectors.
Biofuels are transport fuels that include biodiesel 
(which can be blended with conventional diesel 
to be used in diesel vehicles), bioethanol (which 
can be blended with petrol) and bio-methane 
(which can be used in vehicles fuelled by natural 
gas). Locally produced biofuels have the potential 
to reduce Albania’s current dependence on oil 
imports while improving air quality in urban centres 
and diversifying agriculture and rural economies 
(BioNETT, n.d.).
In Albania, due to the lack of sustainability criteria 
for biofuels and fuel quality requirements, the 
current use of biofuels in the transport sector 
cannot be considered as a renewable energy 
source. Furthermore, local production of biofuels 
in Albania is extremely low. This is despite a biofuel 
law on mandatory blending and tax exemptions 
for locally produced biofuels and raw materials. 
Local biofuel production in Albania is currently 
done by one plant that has the capacity to 
produce approximately 112 million litres of biofuel, 
which amounts to almost 10% of the fuel use in 
transport by volume in 2015. Nevertheless, the 
plant produces 10-15% of its capacity annually and 
imports the vegetable oil raw material. Most of 
the biofuel produced is exported to Italy. Uptake 
in the domestic market is lagging due to a lack of 
enforcement of the biofuel blending obligation and 
the lack of sanctions for noncompliance on biofuel 
blending on the part of fuel suppliers (MIE, 2016). 
To advance the share of renewables in the 
transport sector, biofuels sustainability criteria and 
requirements on biofuel quality must be adopted. 
Thereafter, the compliance with the criteria, as well 
as compliance with mandatory biofuel blending, 
needs to be enforced by delegated institutional 
authorities. 
Furthermore, to meet targets for more sustainable 
sourcing and production of biofuels locally, the 
country’s biomass potential must be assessed for 
biofuel production. This is particularly essential 
as 41% of agricultural land in Albania lays fallow 
and unutilised. Nevertheless, such assessments 
must be conducted in co-operation with the 
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. 
If local production proves economically viable, 
accompanying support incentives must be put 
in place to stimulate investments while ensuring 
demand through the implementation of mandatory 
blending. 
Action 7: Developing a heat bylaw
Albania has much untapped potential for direct 
renewable energy use in heating and cooling, 
particularly in the residential and services sectors. 
Unexploited renewable energy capacities lie in 
the use of heat pumps, which are inadequately 
accounted for in data reporting on the renewable 
energy share. In fact, the contribution of 
aerothermal, geothermal and hydrothermal heat 
pumps is completely omitted in national statistics 
and thereby also in the annual progress reports 
in compliance with EU directives. Methodologies 
must be introduced to account for the use of heat 
pumps and how much this use contributes to the 
renewable energy share in the heating and cooling 
sector. 
The current renewable energy law stipulates that 
the NREAPs set out the measures to achieve the 
national targets for renewable energy shares 
in heating and cooling by 2020. However, a 
dedicated heat bylaw is required to provide 
for appropriate target-setting beyond 2020 for 
various technologies for heating and cooling (such 
as solar thermal, geothermal and heat pumps) 
across the residential, services and industrial 
sectors. Furthermore, the bylaw should provide 
guidance on the mechanisms for the deployment 
of heating technologies and methodologies for 
their contribution to the renewable energy share. 
Data must be collected on sales and use of such 
technologies and reported regularly by AKBN and 
INSTAT. Notably, the Law on Energy Efficiency and 
the Law on Energy Efficiency in Buildings would 
have a direct linkage to the heat bylaw, in that 
energy efficiency measures play a complementary 
role of reducing heating and cooling demand and 
thus the sizing of systems.5.4 RENEWABLE ENERGY FINANCING
The banking system in Albania is relatively liquid 
and offers competitive annual interest rates of 
around 5% in euros and somewhat higher in 
local currency. Nevertheless, the participation of 
the local financial sector in financing renewable 
energy projects is extremely low. The majority 
of energy investments in Albania have been 
through foreign direct investment. Because 
the local banking sector does not have a track 
record of financing non-hydro renewables, 
project proposals are appraised with much riskaversion. Private developers report that collateral 
requirements in approving loans are oftentimes 
valued at 150% of the loan, while project assets 
are not valued as part of the collateral. In part, the 
reasoning for the limited involvement of the local 
banking system, and the increased perceived risk 
in funding renewable energy projects, is rooted 
in the recent bitter history of some hydropower 
generation projects that have not complied with 
various standards for environmental safeguarding. 
In fact, this has deterred even development 
finance institutions (DFIs) from further financing 
hydropower projects. Furthermore, this has 
provoked heightened scrutiny and increased the 
risk perception about renewable energy project 
proposals. The financing sector reports that 
the lack of bankable renewable energy project 
proposals is what is deterring financing in the 
sector. 
Overall, the South East Europe market is quite 
fragmented, and the total amount of investment 
based on national developments and individual 
deals varies. Investors have been appealing to 
governments to stabilise policy and regulatory 
frameworks to boost the region’s renewable 
energy investment. While private investors are 
slowly entering the region’s renewable energy 
market, public finance institutions still play a key 
role in the investment landscape.
One of the key issues – the high cost of capital – is 
mainly due to two aspects of risk premiums that 
are at play. The first aspect is the perception 
that renewable energy projects are more capital 
intensive and riskier than conventional energy 
projects. The second is that investment risk is seen 
to be higher in the region than in the rest of Europe 
due to country-level political and off-taker risks, 
which contribute substantially to the higher cost 
of capital and add to the risk perception related to 
PPAs exposed to local currency fluctuations.
Increasing the use of PPPs between DFIs and 
foreign and local financiers through blended 
finance (on-lending, co-financing) and the issuance 
of innovative instruments (e.g., green bonds) can 
be beneficial. Public finance should also focus on 
the provision of de-risking mechanisms as a tool to 
lower risk premiums and leverage private capital. 
Scaling up renewable energy investments can be 
further encouraged through strengthening the 
quality of renewable energy project proposals 
as well as strengthening the capacities of local 
financial institutions to include renewable energy 
investments under existing asset lending. The 
increased participation of local financial institutions 
is needed for both the larger-scale and small-scale 
projects including end-use sectors and will be 
instrumental in supporting Albania’s renewable 
energy development pathway. 
Action 8: Facilitating financing of bankable 
project proposals
Along with the financial sector, public officials 
also report that many renewable energy project 
proposals received for FiT or during auction 
bidding rounds are not approved and discredited 
as “unbankable” due to the lack of thoroughly 
developed supporting documentation on technical 
and economic pre-feasibility assessments. The 
private sector is thus urged to utilise openly 
available tools and platforms, such as the Climate 
Investment Platform (CIP), for developing bankable 
project proposals and accessing financing.
In supporting the private sector to access 
financing, public institutions play a critical role 
in ensuring the streamlining of procedures; 
establishing safeguarding policies; and 
standardising project documentation, 
contracting and due diligence. Strict monitoring 
of project compliance with various standards and 
safeguards is crucial in reducing the perceived 
risk of investments. Therefore, thoroughly 
developed PPAs are a key element in de-risking investments in renewable energy projects. These 
agreements govern the sale and purchase of 
power between the private power producers 
and OSHEE, creating long-term clarity on roles, 
responsibilities, costs, revenues, standards and 
the associated risks of the projects. In Albania, 
standardising PPAs according to best practice 
for each renewable energy technology, and 
including specific clauses on safeguarding 
policy, can offset some of the perceived risk in 
project appraisal by financing institutions. IRENA 
and Terawatt Initiative’s Open Solar Contracts 
platform provides support for streamlining 
project development and finance processes by 
offering simple and universally applicable legal 
agreements that make contracting much faster 
and less costly.
Apart from financing large-scale power projects, 
local financial institutions are expected to play 
an increasingly crucial role in financing smallerscale distributed systems. The local banking 
sector is therefore required to build its capacities
and better understand the technology and financial 
frameworks for deploying such systems and 
products, and design specific financing products 
accordingly.
The financing of such systems can frequently 
be incorporated under existing asset financing 
portfolios. For example, lending for electric 
vehicles can be incorporated under conventional 
vehicle loans, with minimal tailoring, albeit with 
increased loan tenors. Similarly, housing loans 
can incorporate rooftop solar PV systems, energy 
efficiency measures or efficient heat pumps. 
Nevertheless, such measures are most effectively 
encouraged through the establishment of onlending credit lines from DFIs. An example of this is 
the EU’s EUR 6 million (USD 7.2 million) in funding 
given to Albania’s Union Bank to finance energy 
efficiency measures (EBRD, 2018). Such measures 
can strengthen the capacities of the local banking 
sector in financing renewables, and experiences 
of this need to be shared among members of the 
Albanian Association of Banks.
The Climate Investment Platform (CIP) is a global initiative supported by IRENA, the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP) and Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All), in co-operation with the Green Climate Fund (GCF). 
The CIP’s objective is to step up climate action and translate ambitious national climate targets into concrete 
investments on the ground. While initially focused on energy transition, the ultimate goal of the initiative is to 
accelerate investments in renewable energy and enable the success of the NDCs.
The platform offers an avenue to strengthen existing collaboration and presents an opportunity to consider new 
ways for more effectively bringing together stakeholders to catalyse action, all within existing institutional structures 
and in line with the respective mandates of the partner organisations. In this context, investment forums, a key 
element of IRENA’s strategy to facilitate investments in renewable energy, offer an effective organising framework 
for the implementation of the CIP through a sub-regional approach. 
The sub-regional forums have two main aims: to strengthen the ability of decision makers to build a strong enabling 
environment for renewable energy investments, and to support developers in preparing bankable projects and 
accessing finance. Post-forum project support is also provided. The South East Europe Investment Forum aims to 
scale up renewable energy investments in the region, supporting project development and implementation. Key 
forum activities include matchmaking between projects, project developers, and potential financiers and investors, 
as well as building human and institutional capacity for the energy transition and establishing conducive investment 
frameworks for renewable energy.
In operationalising the CIP, IRENA intends to works with multilateral, bilateral and local financial institutions; private 
companies and investors; and development partners who are prepared to provide financial and technical resources 
and support the realisation of projects.
Box 4 IRENA’s project facilitation through the Climate Investment Platform5.5 CAPACITIES, SKILLS AND AWARENESS
To maximise socio-economic development 
opportunities and spur transformational change, 
energy sector decision makers can strive to build 
up and use the local workforce for renewable 
energy equipment and projects. Human resources, 
adequately skilled and locally available to work on 
various parts of the renewable energy value chain, 
are crucial in supporting the expansion of the 
renewable energy sector. Both training institutions 
and human resources should be attuned to and 
follow the technology trends and market dynamics 
in the fast-evolving energy sector. 
Along with qualified human resources, institutional 
stakeholders too need to ensure adequate
co-operation among themselves and respond in a 
timely manner to the dynamics of the renewable 
energy sector. Institutions need to have adequate 
capacity to fulfil their mandates and contribute to 
renewable energy growth. This includes, among 
others, having adequate capacities in energy data 
collection and analysis and facilitating knowledge 
sharing with other institutions to inform coherent 
policy-making and planning.
Action 9: Raising public awareness on the 
benefits of renewable energy 
From the perspective of energy consumers, high 
upfront investment costs in renewable energy 
and a lack of understanding of payback periods 
for such investments deter wider uptake of 
renewables in Albania. Furthermore, the public is 
not always aware of existing incentives, support 
mechanisms or plans for the deployment of 
renewable energy technologies. Although the 
private enterprises involved in installation of solar 
PV net-metering or SWH systems do make efforts 
in marketing their services to potential customers, 
government-backed efforts can be more impactful 
in reaching scale and wider audiences. As such, 
wider adoption of renewable energy in Albania, 
both utility scale and at the household level, 
requires government-backed, well-formulated 
awareness-raising strategies to sensitise the public 
on the direct benefits of renewable energy, both 
for individual citizens and the country as a whole. 
As discussed in Chapter  4 of this report, such 
benefits include the economic benefits of 
using more cost-effective renewable energy 
technologies, enhancing energy security through 
increased domestic production during current 
times of energy imports, and creating a more 
climate-resilient energy system through a more 
diversified energy mix. As part of awarenessraising campaigns, incentives and support 
mechanisms for renewable energy uptake need to 
be clearly communicated so as to emphasise the 
country’s commitment to and support for more 
environmentally friendly energy use. Additionally, 
coherently communicating the government’s 
plans for the development of the sector can 
boost investors’ confidence and thereby attract 
investment in the energy sector. Led by the MIE, 
awareness-raising campaigns can be designed 
and executed with various energy stakeholders, 
and through various platforms of communication. 
Ultimately, such strategies should have the objective 
of improving public knowledge of the economics 
and benefits of renewable energy technologies 
and the need for their wider deployment in order to 
enhance a more informed and responsible energy 
consumption behaviour, while attracting desired 
investments for the energy sector’s development.
Action 10: Enhancing institutional capacities 
and local human resources
In line with Albania’s commitment to a higher 
share of renewable energy deployment, a skilled 
workforce needs to be nurtured from the onset. 
Currently, Albania lacks dedicated renewable 
energy training curricula at vocational, tertiary 
and technical schools. This has created a lack 
of qualified human resources in the country to 
support the ongoing energy sector developments. 
The localisation of the value chain and nurturing 
a skilled local workforce is a precondition for 
maximising community benefits and ensuring that 
revenue streams support the local economy. As 
such, the ministries in charge of energy, training 
and education should collectively work towards 
the introduction of renewable energy training 
curricula, prioritising solar PV installers and energy 
auditors in the immediate term. A lack of trained and locally available human 
resources is reported by the private sector as one 
of its main hinderances in business operation and 
seeking funding. For example, although there are 
many electricians, there is a shortage of qualified 
solar PV installers and energy auditors in the 
country. A lack of energy auditors is in particular 
stagnating the growth of solar PV net-metering 
systems in new buildings. According to law, 
before a net-metering system can be approved, 
the building’s energy consumption for the past 
two years is needed. Alternatively, in place of the 
historic data for new buildings, an energy auditor 
is to estimate the building’s energy consumption 
patterns. As licenced energy installers are largely 
unavailable to carry out the audits, the netmetering system installations cannot be approved. 
The MIE together with the Energy Efficiency 
Agency, who is the certifying body for energy 
auditors, should work together on expediting the 
licencing of accredited energy auditors and seek 
adequate funding for this purpose. 
Furthermore, human resources in public 
institutions, and institutional capacities overall, 
play a crucial role in supporting effective policymaking, regulation and planning of renewable 
energy. As the sector is fast evolving, renewable 
energy technology costs are falling, new 
technologies and applications are being marketed, 
and new best practices in policy-making are 
emerging. 
Up-to-date monitoring and analysis of this 
information is needed. For this, data information 
and its adequate analysis and interpretation are 
crucial, particularly in evidence-basing certain 
decisions or plans. As the most fundamental 
datasets, statistics on the country’s energy sector 
need to be improved and methodologies of data 
gathering and processing need to be strengthened. 
Disaggregated data related to energy use and 
consumption at the subsector level are not easily 
accessible in Albania. In some instances, statistical 
data reported are regarded as inconsistent as, for 
example, was the issue on the share of cooking 
energy and fuels in the residential sector during 
the RRA consultative process. 
INSTAT, as the central body accumulating and 
processing statistical data, should therefore work 
with AKBN (the energy data provider) and other 
partners that receive statistical information (such 
as EUROSTAT and the World Bank) to further 
strengthen their institutional capacities for energy 
data processing and reporting.
Action 11: Strengthening communication and
co-operation among stakeholders
As discussed in Chapter  2 of this report, the 
energy sector involves multiple stakeholders, each 
with distinct responsibilities and contributions 
to the sector’s operation and development. 
During the consultative process of this RRA, it 
has become apparent that co-operation and 
communication among all relevant actors can 
be further strengthened to ensure the exchange 
of updated information regarding the sector’s 
evolution. Furthermore, this could ensure that 
challenges facing individual stakeholders are 
clearly communicated and collectively addressed. 
The Albanian Renewable Energy Association, due 
to the country’s history of hydropower production, 
has a stronger focus on hydro than non-hydro 
renewables. With the emergence of more nonhydro enterprises, these enterprises need to 
take a more assertive role in communicating 
their operational challenges and, through the 
association, voice these challenges to relevant 
authorities who could take action to alleviate 
or resolve them. This can avoid information 
asymmetries and ensure better communication 
between the private and public sectors. 
As the sector is fast evolving, renewable energy 
technology costs are falling, new technologies and 
applications are being marketed, and new best practices
in policy-making are emerging.BioNETT (n.d.), Biofuels handbook: Best practice
