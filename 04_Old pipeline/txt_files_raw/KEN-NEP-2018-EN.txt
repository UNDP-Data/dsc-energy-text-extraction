VISION
Affordable Quality Energy 
for All Kenyans
MISSION
To Facilitate Provision of Clean, 
Sustainable, Affordable, Competitive, 
Reliable and Secure Energy 
Services at Least Cost while 
Protecting the EnvironmentFOREWORD BY THE CABINET SECRETARY
The enactment of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 substantially transformed the governance structure of 
the country and enhanced citizen‘s participation in administrative decision making processes. This Policy 
document is a result of extensive consultations within the sector and the wider government, insightful 
benchmarking on best practises from different jurisdictions around the globe and most importantly 
stakeholder engagement and public participation through workshops held in all the 47 counties. The 
document sets out the national policies and strategies for the energy sector.
The overall national development objectives of the Government of Kenya as set out in the development 
blue print, Kenya Vision 2030 include accelerated economic growth; increasing productivity of all sectors; 
equitable distribution of national income; poverty alleviation through improved access to basic needs; 
enhanced agricultural production; industrialisation; accelerated employment creation and improved ruralurban balance. The realisation of these objectives will be feasible if quality energy services are availed in 
a sustainable, competitive, cost effective and affordable manner to all sectors of the economy ranging 
from manufacturing, services, mining, and agriculture to households.
With the discovery of oil and coal there is need to put in place an appropriate policy, legal regulatory and 
institutional framework to ensure that the country benefits from these resources and is able to deal with 
opportunities associated with exploiting these resources towards addressing the country‘s energy needs. 
Several initiatives are being pursued to enhance the country‘s power generation capacity and to diversify 
the energy mix. The intention is to ensure competitive power to drive the socio-economic transformation 
that this country desires.
We submit these Policy recommendations with optimism. Even though the tasks ahead are challenging, 
they remain achievable. To address our energy challenges, we must put to good use the resources and 
the talents around and within us. I call upon all stakeholders in the energy sector to work together to 
ensure that the proposals contained in this policy are implemented.
Hon. Charles Keter, EGH 
Cabinet Secretary
Ministry of Energy PREFACE BY THE PRINCIPAL SECRETARY
In the last ten years the Policy direction of the energy sector has been governed by Sessional Paper No. 
4 of 2004 on Energy. However, a number of changes have taken place presenting new challenges and 
opportunities. The unveiling of the national development blueprint, Kenya Vision 2030, in 2008 and 
promulgation of the Constitution of Kenya on 27th August, 2010 and the Government‘s Big Four Agenda 
made it necessary to review the sector policy.
The energy sector plays a critical role in the socio-economic development of the country. Indeed, 
petroleum and electricity as sources of energy are the main drivers of the economy. Discoveries of oil and 
coal present opportunities for the country to develop the sector and the economy. The Ministry has made 
concerted efforts in the development of an appropriate legal, regulatory and institutional framework for 
utilization of these resources for the country‘s energy needs. Local content development in the sector 
remains a pivotal agenda for the Ministry. At the same time, interventions have been made at ensuring 
increased access to electricity supply by industries and households. The ―last mile project‖ is one such 
intervention, specifically targeting households, with the aim of achieving universal access by 2020.
The major challenges facing the energy sector include; improving the competitiveness, quantity, reliability 
and quality of supply; high initial capital outlay and the long lead times from feasibility studies to 
development of infrastructure; mobilizing adequate financial resources to undertake massive investment 
in the power sector, high cost of energy, low per capita incomes and low levels of industrialization. The 
policy recommendations contained herein seek to address these challenges.
Successful implementation of this Policy will require all stakeholders to play their role effectively so as to 
make the vision of affordable quality energy to all Kenyans a reality. The Ministry will provide overall 
leadership, oversight, guidance and direction to ensure full implementation of this Policy.
Dr. Eng. Joseph K. Njoroge, CBS
Principal Secretary
Ministry of Energy EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Preamble
1. The process of formulating this Policy entailed comprehensive reference of the Constitution, 
Sessional Paper No. 4 of 2004 on Energy, Energy Act 2006, legislation and regulations applying in 
the energy sector, other policies, administrative procedures, government guidelines and circulars 
relating to energy. All the energy sector organizations carried a situational analysis and prepared a 
Position Paper that formed the basis for the initial draft of the policy which was then shared and 
discussed with stakeholders at a National Workshop in Nairobi County followed by similar workshops 
in the other 46 counties. Desktop analysis and benchmarking with several selected countries were 
also undertaken. Further consultations with key government ministries, departments and agencies 
as well as key energy sector stakeholders were held. A National Validation Workshop was 
subsequently held where several suggestions and comments were received, including request by 
several stakeholders for additional time to allow for further input. This document has been enriched 
from the foregoing consultative process which has been participatory and transparent as required by 
the Constitution.
2. This Policy document is organised into nine substantive chapters, starting with the Introduction under 
Chapter 1. Chapter 2 deals with Coal while Chapter 3 provides for Renewable Energy including 
electricity generation from geothermal and hydro resources. Chapter 4 covers Electricity while 
Chapter 5 provides for Energy Efficiency and Conservation. Chapter 6 covers Land, Environment, 
Health and Safety. Chapters 7, 8 and 9 deal with Devolution and Provision of Energy Services; 
Energy Financing, Pricing and Socio-Economic Issues; and Cross Cutting Issues respectively. The 
Acronyms and Glossary of Terms used herein are provided after Chapter 9.
Introduction
3. The overall objective of this Energy Policy is to ensure affordable, competitive, sustainable and 
reliable supply of energy at the least cost in order to achieve the national and county development 
needs, while protecting and conserving the environment for inter-generational benefits.
4. The energy sector has been guided by the Sessional Paper No. 4 of 2004 on Energy and governed 
by several legislation, principally the Energy Act, No. 12 of 2006 and the Geothermal Resources Act 
No. 12, of 1982. The Feed in Tariff Policy 2008 which was last revised in 2012 has been instrumental 
in accelerating investment in the renewable energy sub sector. Adoption of the Kenya Vision 2030 
and the promulgation of the Constitution, 2010, made it necessary to review both the Policy and the 
applicable legislation and regulations so as to align them with the Vision and the Constitution. Coal
5. Coal is an affordable, competitive, reliable and easily accessible source of energy, especially for 
electricity generation. Extensive coal exploration has taken place in the Mui Basin of Kitui County 
where a total of 76 wells have been drilled with 42 wells intercepting coal seams of various 
thicknesses at different depths. More wells are being drilled to appraise the coal reserves in the 
basin of which Block C has been appraised to have 400 million tonnes. More coal exploration is 
going on in other parts of the country. These resources are expected to provide about 2,000MW of 
electricity generation by 2030.
6. The Government shall promote efficient utilisation of coal resources while minimising the 
environmental impacts associated with its use. A conducive investment environment targeting power 
generation from coal will be created by providing fiscal incentives to attract investment in this sector. 
Renewable Energy
7. Renewable energy, derived from the naturally occurring resources including geothermal, hydro, solar, 
wind, ocean energy, biomass, biofuels, biogas and municipal waste can supply our energy needs and 
those of future generations in a sustainable way if effectively harnessed through careful planning and 
advanced technology. In addition, renewable energy has potential to enhance energy security, 
mitigate climate change, generate income, create employment and generate foreign exchange 
savings.
8. To enhance exploitation of the vast geothermal resources that Kenya is endowed with, the 
Government will continue to fund the Geothermal Development Company (GDC) so as to manage 
the geothermal exploration risk and attract investors. As at 2017, Geothermal‘s contribution to the 
total grid installed capacity of 2,333.07MW was at 652MW (28%). Further, the Government will 
encourage investment in the geothermal subsector so as to achieve at least 1,093MW of geothermal 
electric power generation by 2020 and 2,056MW by 2024, and enhance direct use of the resource.
9. Kenya has an estimated hydropower potential of about 6,000MW comprising of large hydros (sites 
with capacity of more than 10MW) and small hydros. Of the large hydros, 823.8MW has been 
exploited and accounts for 35.3% of installed generation capacity as at 2017. Potential for small 
hydros is over 3,000MW, of which, less than 25MW has been developed.
10. In view of the vulnerability of hydropower to variations in hydrology and climate, it will be necessary to 
put in place a mechanism to cushion generators, transmitters, distributors and consumers against the 
effects of adverse hydrology.11. The National Government shall establish an inter-ministerial Renewable Energy Resources Advisory 
Committee (RERAC) to, inter alia, advise the Cabinet Secretary on:
(a) Criteria for allocation of energy resource areas to investors.
(b) Licensing of Renewable Energy resource areas.
(c) Management of water towers and catchment areas.
(d) Development of multi-purpose projects such as dams and reservoirs for power generation, 
portable water, flood control and irrigation with a view to ensuring proper coordination at policy, 
regulatory and operational levels on matters relating to the various uses of water resources.
(e) Management and development of other energy resources such as agricultural and municipal 
waste, forests, and areas with good wind regimes, tidal and wave energy.
12. The National Government shall transform the Rural Electrification Authority into the Rural 
Electrification and Renewable Energy Corporation (RERC) to be the lead agency for development of 
renewable energy resources other than geothermal and large hydros.
Electricity
13. Electricity is a secondary source of energy generated through the consumption of primary energy 
sources namely petroleum, coal, renewable energy and nuclear energy. Due to its versatility in 
utilization, electricity is crucial to the socio-economic development of the country. Access to electricity 
is associated with rising or high quality of life.
14. Reform and restructuring of the Kenyan electricity supply industry (ESI) has been going on since the 
mid-90s with the aims of, inter alia:
(a) Creating appropriate legal, regulatory and institutional framework for the industry.
(b) Ensuring provision of affordable, competitive, reliable, efficient and sustainable electric power 
supplies.
(c) Increasing the population‘s access to electricity as a means of stimulating economic growth.
(d) Improving the efficiency of power distribution and supply through reductions in system losses 
and enhanced collection of revenues.
(e) Creating a more competitive market structures with clear delineation of roles for public and 
private sector players in generation, transmission, distribution and retail functions.
15. In order to provide affordable and competitive electrical energy to transform Kenya‘s economy, a 
roadmap to raise the generation capacity by at least 5,000MW from 1,664MW as at October, 2013 
to slightly over 6,700 MW by 2024 is proposed. Through this plan the Government will in the 
medium to long term commit itself to development of technologies that result to least cost based on technology of screening curves. The screening curves take into account the elements of capacity 
factor, capital and discount rates. As at December, 2017, the installed capacity had reached 2,336 
MW
16. The National Government shall:-
(a) Establish the Energy Institute to, inter alia, promote and implement a nuclear electricity 
generation programme.
(b) Develop and monitor implementation of electricity master plans for the country and the Eastern 
African Region.
(c) Support the development by KETRACO of new transmission lines, comprising of about 5,000 
km in the short term and 16,000 km by 2031 to enhance security, reliability and affordability of 
electricity supply.
(d) Facilitate open access to the transmission and distribution networks, designate a System 
Operator and encourage regional interconnections to enhance regional electricity trade.
(e) Provide incentives for development of robust distribution networks to ensure efficient and safe 
provision of distribution services by duly licensed network service providers, so as to reduce 
power supply interruptions and improve the quality of supply and service.
(f) Formulate and implement a National Electrification Strategy to accelerate connection with a 
view to achieving universal access to electricity by 2020.
(g) Continue funding the development of distribution networks through RERC.
Energy Efficiency and Conservation
17. The importance of energy efficiency and conservation in the Kenyan economy cannot be 
overemphasized. Challenges impacting on the implementation of energy efficiency and conservation 
measures include lack of awareness of the benefits and methods of conservation, apathy, limited 
technical capacity and inadequate data.
18. The Government shall:
(a) Develop and implement sustainable, awareness and sensitization programmes on energy 
efficiency and conservation;
(b) Implement energy efficiency and conservation initiatives in all sectors;
(c) Undertake research and development in energy efficiency and conservation; and
(d) Collaborate with the private sector in energy efficiency and conservation.Land, Environment, Health and Safety
19. Land is a critical resource in the development of energy infrastructure. However, due to competing 
interest in land utilization, the sector faces challenges in developing its infrastructure. Prudent 
environmental management is key to ensuring sustainable development of the sector.
20. In carrying out its planning and development mandate pursuant to the Fourth Schedule, Part 2, 
paragraph 8 (e) regarding electricity and gas reticulation and energy regulation, every county 
government shall set aside suitable land for energy infrastructure development purposes, including 
but not limited to projects recommended in the indicative national energy plans.
21. The Government shall facilitate:
(a) Development of a National Resettlement Action Plan Framework for energy related projects; 
including livelihood restoration in the event of physical displacement of communities.
(b) Access to land where exploration blocks fall on private land, community land and cultural 
heritage areas including game parks/reserves.
(c) Establish strategies and mechanisms to eliminate wood fuel, charcoal and kerosene as a 
household energy source by 2022.
(d) Creation of disaster response units in each county and in relevant energy sector entities.
Devolution and Provision of Energy Services
22. Under the Constitution, the functions of energy policy including electricity and energy regulation have 
been assigned to the National Government while electricity and gas reticulation are assigned to the 
County Governments.
23. To avoid uncertainty and/or overlap of responsibilities, a framework on the functional devolution of 
roles between the two levels of government has been developed in consultation with all stakeholders.
Energy Financing, Pricing and Socio-Economic Issues
24. The Government shall:
(a) Explore and adopt all viable financing options from local and international sources for cost 
effective utilization of all its energy resources, and in so doing shall endeavour to maintain a 
competitive fiscal investment climate in the country.
(b) Support Public Private Partnerships in the development, operation and maintenance of energy 
infrastructure and delivery systems.
25. The Government shall set up a Consolidated Energy Fund to fund infrastructure development; energy 
sector environmental disaster mitigation, response and recovery; hydro risk mitigation; water towers conservation programmes; energy efficiency and conservation programmes as well as promotion of 
renewable energy initiatives.
Cross Cutting Issues
26. Research, development and dissemination as well as human resource development are key in 
achieving the objectives of this Policy. It is therefore necessary to provide for the Energy Institute to 
undertake training, research, development, dissemination, nurture talent, innovation and to enhance 
capacity building in the sector.
27. The Government shall:
(a) Promote a conducive environment to attract investments in the energy sector, taking into 
account the needs and ability of the people of Kenya.
(b) Develop and implement a local content policy and regulations to facilitate participation of 
Kenyans in the energy sector, including utilization of locally available goods, services and 
human resources.
(c) Put in place framework for pro-active and sustained engagement between the two levels of 
government, investors and communities in energy resource areas.
28. Full and timely implementation of this Policy will go a long in facilitating transformation of Kenya into a 
globally competitive, newly industrialized, middle income and prosperous country with a high quality 
of life to all its citizens in a clean and secure environment by 2030. Electricity will be affordable, 
competitive and reliable with a balanced energy mix. The oil and gas as well as coal sub-sectors will 
have well developed infrastructure and supply since the preliminary findings show high potential. 
Local content in the sector will also be well developed for enhanced national productivity.1.0 – INTRODUCTION
1.1 THE ROLE OF ENERGY IN NATIONAL ECONOMY
1. Energy is a critical component in the economy, standard of living and national security of a country. 
The level and the intensity of energy use in a country is a key indicator of economic growth and 
development. The Kenya Vision 2030 identified energy as one of the infrastructure enablers of its 
socio-economic pillar. Sustainable, competitive, affordable and reliable energy for all citizens is a key 
factor in realization of the Vision.
2. Over the next five years, the Government aims to focus on manufacturing, universal healthcare, food 
security and affordable (the ―Big Four‖) to further strengthen the economy, progress industrialization 
and create jobs, thereby contributing towards the realization of the Vision 2030
3. Kenya‘s implementation of appropriate broad-based policies has led to a stable macroeconomic 
environment resulting in positive economic growth of 5.7%, 5.9%, 4.9% in the year 2015, 2016 and 
2017 respectively. The setting up of County Governments after the general elections held in 2013 
have also impacted positively on economic growth as public expenditure rose in line with the 
devolved system of government. Despite this outcome, low productivity in agriculture, weak 
manufacturing sector and weak transport system in the face of rising imports and stagnating exports 
are major concerns.
4. The country has continued to experience a relatively low and stable inflation, moderate interest rates 
and a relatively stable shilling against the major trading currencies. Key macroeconomic indicators 
have remained fairly stable with overall inflation rate decreasing significantly from 6.6% in 2015 and 
to 6.3% in 2016. This was attributed to lower energy and transport prices. In 2017, interest rates 
declined due to the impact of their capping that became effective in September 2016. In the money 
market, the Kenyan Shilling strengthened against most of the major trading currencies but weakened 
against the Euro and the US Dollar in 2017. The current account deficit widened on account of 
significant growth of imports against a slower growth of exports. Thus, there was a moderate build up 
in inflationary pressure from 6.3% in 2016 to 8.0% in 2017 mainly due to significant increase in oil 
and food prices.
5. Real GDP is expected to continue to improve, largely because of expansion in tourism, ICT, 
transport, construction, industrialization, investments in the energy sector and recovery in agriculture.
6. The principal taxation policy pursued by the Government of Kenya (GoK) in the energy sector is 
based on the need to create a sustainable balance between fiscal revenue generation and to ensure 
access to modern energy services by the low income segments of the population at reasonable 
prices. GoK also uses taxation as an instrument to discourage wasteful consumption of energy, and 
by extension, to encourage its efficient utilization in a cost effective manner. 
7. Given this policy regime, the energy sector has continued to play its role as a significant contributor 
to fiscal revenues through taxes, levies and duties imposed on various petroleum products, electrical 
energy and materials sourced by service providers for operations, maintenance and infrastructure 
expansion.
8. Energy shortages and supply disruptions coupled with high cost remain serious obstacles to 
economic activity. Tax and other concessions are planned to encourage investment in development of energy infrastructure particularly by private investors involved in power generation from geothermal 
as well as other forms of renewable energy such as wind, solar and biomass.
9. The cost of energy has significant impact on economic activities particularly those that are energy 
intensive such as cement, steel, pulp and paper production. In a liberalized market such as Kenya, 
energy prices are significant determinants of competitiveness of locally manufactured goods relative 
to imports. In this regard, high energy prices impact negatively on domestic wealth creation, balance 
of payments and employment creation since consumers opt for cheaper imports.

energy efficiency and conservation efforts in Kenya.2.0 – COAL RESOURCES
2.1 Overview
1. Coal is a readily combustible rock containing more than 50% by weight and more than 70% by 
volume of carbonaceous material formed from compaction of variously altered plant remains. It is 
used as a source of energy, mainly for electricity generation. It is the most affordable fuel worldwide 
and has potential to become the most reliable and easily accessible energy source.
2. Coal has been identified as one of the indigenous sources of energy that will drive the development 
of strategic initiatives for Kenya Vision 2030. It was recognized that the key to increased development 
lay in early identification of indigenous energy sources, exploiting them and establishing an 
appropriate institutional framework for their delivery to consumers.
3. The country has coal deposits for commercial exploitation and the Government is fast tracking 
exploration and development of the resource for power generation and other industrial uses.
4. The introduction of Clean Coal Technologies (CCTs) in coal fired power plants reduces emissions 
and extracts sulphur and carbon from the atmosphere thus making coal an environmentally viable 
source of energy.
2.2 Demand for Coal
1. In Kenya, coal is mainly used by cement manufacturers to complement heavy fuel oil for process 
heat. As at December 2017, consumption of coal declined from 486.29 thousand tonnes of oil 
equivalent to 462.7 thousand tonnes of oil equivalent. 
2. Coal consumption is expected to increase with the discovery and mining of coal deposits in Mui Basin 
in Kitui County mainly for electricity generation among other uses. Exploration is also ongoing in 
other parts of the country.
3. As a medium term measure, the Government intends to import coal to support electricity generation.
2.2.1 Midstream and Downstream Coal Development
1. The Government is working with a strategic investor to build a coal fired power plant in Lamu County 
in the coastal region. Phase 1 of the plant will have a capacity of 960MW. Construction of the plant 
is expected to be in operation in the year 2024 running on imported coal. However, there is need to 
develop adequate and appropriate coal handling and storage facilities onshore.
2. The Government has concessioned Blocks in the Mui Basin for coal resource development with the 
objective of generating about 1,000MW in Kitui County as part of the coal contribution of 2,000MW in 
the 5,000+MW project. 
2.2.2 Challenges in Midstream and Downstream Coal
1. Inadequate technical capacity for coal midstream and downstream activities.
2. Absence of large import coal handling facilities.
3. Underdeveloped road and railway transportation system.
4. Negative public perceptions on use of coal to generate electricity.5. Limited funding for coal generation projects.
6. Undeveloped capacity to store and evacuate coal products.
7. High initial cost of acquiring the necessary infrastructure. (land – check in cross cutting)

  3.0 – RENEWABLE ENERGY
3.1 BACKGROUND
1. Renewable Energy (RE) is derived from natural processes that are replenished constantly. In its 
various forms, it derives directly or indirectly from the sun, or from heat generated deep within the 
earth. Included in the definition is energy generated from solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, 
hydropower and ocean resources, as well as bio-fuels and hydrogen derived from renewable 
resources. All these resources can supply our needs and those of future generations in a sustainable 
way. Effectively harnessing these renewable resources requires careful planning and advanced 
technology.
2. RE has the potential to enhance energy security and reliability; generate income and create 
employment; enable substantial foreign exchange savings by reducing dependence on imported fuels 
and its attendant price volatility, and mitigate climate change as it has minimal adverse effects on the 
environment.
3. According to data from MoE, biomass provides about 69% of the country‘s overall energy 
requirements while petroleum accounts for about 22% and electricity about 9%. As at June, 2017
65.6% of the electricity component was generated using renewable energy sources with fossil fuels 
providing the balance of 34.4% as indicated table 4.3.
3.2 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY
3.2.1 Background
1. Geothermal is the energy formed due to the 
Earth‘s natural heat. The heat is due to 
primordial energy generated during earth‘s 
formation that is produced from decay of 
radioactive elements like uranium, thorium and 
potassium. The amount of heat within 10,000 
metres of the earth's surface contains 50,000 
times more energy than all the oil and natural gas 
resources in the world.
Figure 3.1 - Location of Geothermal Resource 
Areas in Kenya
2. The areas with the highest underground 
temperatures are in regions with active or 
geologically young volcanoes. These occur at 
plate boundaries or at places where the crust is 
thin enough to let the heat through.
3. In Kenya, more than 14 high temperature 
potential sites occur along the Rift Valley with an 
estimated potential of more than 10,000 MWe. 
Other locations include Chyulu, Homa Hills in 
Nyanza, Mwananyamala at the Coast and 
Nyambene Ridges; as shown in Figure 3.1 
across.4. Geothermal power plants use steam or hot water from a natural underground reservoir to generate 
electrical energy. Other uses of geothermal energy include:
(a) Dairy industry - refrigeration and pasteurization of milk products.
(b) Grain Silos - drying of grains (wheat & maize) and other farm products e.g. pyrethrum.
(c) Space heating and cooling - green houses, residential houses, hotels and other buildings.
(d) Industry - production of industrial sulphur, treatment of hides and skins and honey processing.
(e) Water heating for fish and crocodile farming, spas and swimming pools.
5. Geothermal projects typically progress through stages of reconnaissance, surface exploration, 
feasibility study, exploratory drilling, appraisal drilling, production drilling, steam field development 
and power plant construction stages
3.2.2 Challenges
1. Relatively long lead time of between 5-7 years from conception to production of electricity.
2. High upfront investment costs.
3. High resource exploration and development risks.
4. Inadequate geothermal expertise.
5. The resources are site specific.
6. Heavy investment in transmission and other support infrastructure due to long distances to existing 
load centres.
7. Land use conflict.

2018-2026
Long Term 
2018-2030
1. The Government shall continue to support and fund geothermal
resource assessment and development so as to manage the 
geothermal exploration risk and attract investors.
  
2. Promote research, development and capacity building for 
geothermal development by providing fiscal and other incentives.

5. The government to enforce compliance with the regulatory 
requirement to utilize the best available technologies that optimise 
the resource and conserve the reservoir 
  
6. Promote early geothermal generation through implementation of 
efficient modular geothermal technologies.
  3.3 HYDROPOWER
1. Hydropower is electricity generated using the energy of moving water. Rain or melted snow, usually 
originating in hills and mountains, create streams and rivers that eventually run to lakes, seas or 
oceans. This energy has been exploited for centuries. In the late 19thcentury, hydropower became a 
source for generating electricity.
2. A typical hydro plant is a system with three parts: an electric plant where the electricity is produced; a 
dam that can be opened or closed to control water flow; and a reservoir where water can be stored. 
The amount of electricity that can be generated depends on how far the water drops and how much 
water moves through the system.
3. Hydropower is also readily available; engineers can control the flow of water through the turbines to 
produce electricity on demand. In addition, reservoirs may offer recreational opportunities, such as 
swimming and boating. But damming rivers may destroy or disrupt wildlife and other natural 
resources.
4. Hydropower is, to date, the most successful form of renewable energy. The amount of electrical 
energy generated depends upon the quantity of available water. Adverse hydrology can have a 
devastating effect on an economy that is heavily dependent on hydropower such as Kenya at 
present.
5. Kenya has a considerable hydropower potential estimated at - 6,000MW as at December, 2017 
comprising of large hydros (sites with capacity of more than 10MW) and small hydros. Potential for 
small hydros is over 3,000MW, of which about 17.5MW has been developed.
6. There are five major water towers in Kenya, namely: Mt Kenya, Aberdare Ranges, Mau Complex, the 
Cherangani Hills and Mt. Elgon as depicted in Figure 3.2 below. These water towers give rise to five 
drainage basins which are critical to the country‘s socio economic well being. The major drainage 
basins are those of Tana River and Lake Victoria.
3.3.1 Large Hydros
3.3.1.1 Background
1. As at December 2017, the installed capacity of hydropower generation was 823.8MW equivalent to 
35.3% of total installed capacity. It is estimated that the undeveloped hydroelectric power potential of 
economic significance is 1,630MW. Average energy production from these potential projects is 
estimated to be at least 5,605 GWh per annum. This hydropower potential is located in five 
geographical regions, representing Kenya‘s major drainage basins: Lake Victoria (329MW), Rift 
Valley (305MW), Athi River (60MW), Tana River (790MW) and Ewaso Ng‘iro North River (146MW).
2. Beyond the existing schemes, Kenya still has substantial hydropower potential. This is reflected by 
current plans to develop large hydro projects in Karura and High Grand Falls (both in the Tana 
catchment area), Nandi Forest (in the Lake Victoria North catchment area) and Magwagwa (in the 
Lake Victoria South catchment area), and Arror (in the Rift Valley area). This development could lead 
to additional hydropower capacity of over 800 MW in the long term. There is a large pipeline of small 
hydropower projects under the Feed in Tariff (FiT) scheme. Feasibility studies of smaller hydropower 
projects are still on-going.Figure 3.2 - The 5 Water Towers and Drainage Basins
3.3.1.2 Challenges
1. Hydropower is vulnerable to variations in hydrology and climate change, leading to reduction of water 
levels in reservoirs and thus reducing the contribution of hydro power in the energy mix.
2. Inadequate storage capacity in existing power generating reservoirs.
3. The economic risk in hydropower projects is high.
4. Relocation and resettlement of affected persons to create room for the construction reservoirs.
5. Long lead time of between 7-10 years.
6. Inadequate hydrological data within the region.
7. Water levies that have a direct effect on the cost of hydro generated electricity.
8. Conflicting and competing land and water uses between various sub-sectors of the economy with 
regard to development and utilization of the same for electricity generation.
9. Absence of synergies and competing interests in the management of hydropower generating 
infrastructure leading to delays in implementation of viable energy projects 3.3.1.3 Policies and Strategies

6. The government to invest in increased storage capacity for hydro 
power reservoirs.
  
7. The government to finance pre-feasibility studies for identification 
of potential hydropower sites.
  
3.3.2 Small Hydros
3.3.2.1 Background
1. Small hydros are hydropower schemes whose potential does not exceed 10MW. The total estimated 
potential of small, mini, micro and pico hydro systems is 3,000MW. Most of this potential is situated 
within the country‘s five main drainage basins. The implementation of some of these projects are
undertaken by both the Government and private investors. As at the end of 2017 Government run 
schemes were a total of 11.7MW while those by private developers were about 5.81MW.
2. The government introduced the Feed-in-Tariff (FiT) policy in 2008 to promote the development of 
renewable energy to supply villages, small businesses or farms, as well as grid supply.
3. The Ministry of Energy has carried out feasibility studies for small hydros in tea growing areas 
covering twelve sites with an estimated combined potential generation capacity of 33MW. Feasibility 
studies are on-going at 14 other sites and will be expanded to cover other areas and the results used 
for capital mobilization for development of the sites. As at 2017, only a few schemes had been 
developed as stand-alone systems or to feed to the national grid4. By the end of 2017, more than 260 small 
hydropower sites had been identified but 
the largest number of sites are found in the 
Tana River drainage basin, mainly in the 
counties of Kirinyaga, Muranga, Meru and 
Tharaka Nithi.
5. The map in Figure 3.2 shows locations of 
small hydropower sites appraised by MoE 
(dots in green colour) as well as a summary 
compilation from various studies (dots in 
red colour). As can be seen, the potential 
for small hydropower sites is mainly located 
in counties that have high population 
density and high energy demand.
Figure 3.2: Small Hydropower Schemes
3.3.2.2 Challenges
Development of small hydros subsector has faced the following challenges:
1. Destruction of catchment areas, threatening long term viability of small hydro power projects.
2. Inadequate financial resources and technical personnel for carrying out feasibility studies and 
development of sites.

  3.4 BIOMASS
3.4.1 Background
1. Biomass is organic matter that can be used to provide heat, make fuel and generate electricity. 
Wood-fuel, the largest source of biomass has been used to provide heat for thousands of years. 
Many other types of biomass are also used as an energy source such as plant residue from 
agriculture or forestry and the organic component of municipal and industrial wastes. Landfill gas is 
also considered a biomass source. Biomass resources can be replenished through afforestation 
programmes.
2. There is a gap between the existing tree cover vis-a-vis the minimum requirement of 10% prescribed 
by the Forest Conservation Management Act No. 34 of 2016. The continuous overreliance of 
Biomass as a primary source of energy threatens achievement of this requirement.
3. Biomass fuels are the largest source of primary energy in Kenya with wood-fuel (firewood and 
charcoal) accounting for about 69% of the total primary energy consumption. About 55% of this is 
derived from farmlands in the form of woody biomass as well as crop residue and animal waste and 
the remaining 45% is derived from forests.
4. Wood fuel supply management is crucial to ensure sustainable supply to meet the growing demand. 
Key issues here include: competing land use activities, the growing imbalance between supply and 
demand and the attendant adverse environmental as well as related land and tree tenure issues, 
among others.
5. The Government has promoted agro forestry and social forestry programmes to increase the stock of 
woody biomass on farms to make up for the loss of forest trees as forestland is converted into 
agricultural and settlement land. This is a multidisciplinary effort involving the ministries responsible 
for energy, agriculture and environment and natural resources.
3.4.2 Challenges
1. Unsustainable use of biomass with attendant negative impacts on the environment.
2. Widening gap between supply and demand for wood-fuel.
3. Emissions from wood fuel leading to health hazards among users.
4. Weak enforcement of the legal and regulatory framework for sustainable production, distribution and 
marketing of biomass.
5. Insufficient promotion of sustainable afforestation programmes.
6. Inadequate data on biomass production and consumption.
7. Uncoordinated approach in policy formulation and implementation by the relevant ministries and 
organizations to reduce overreliance on biomass as a primary source of energy.
8. Inadequate recognition of alternative clean modern energy sources to reduce overreliance on 
biomass energy source.
9. Lack of efficient technologies for production, conversion and consumption of biomass energy.
10. Competing interests over land use between biomass production, food production and other 
commercial uses.3.4.3 Policies and Strategies

3.5 BIOFUELS
3.5.1 Background
1. Unlike other renewable sources, biomass can be converted directly into liquid fuels called biofuels to 
meet energy needs.
2. The use of biofuels would reduce pollution and save on foreign exchange required for importing 
petroleum fuel, improve on the balance of trade and create employment.
3. A strategy for introduction of biofuel blends in the market was developed by the Government in 2010. 
Facilities for ethanol-gasoline blending have been completed in Kisumu to be followed by Eldoret and 
Nakuru. However, there aren‘t sufficient quantities of bio-ethanol feed-stocks.
4. Land will need to be set aside for the production of energy crops as feed-stock for bio-fuels. Most 
bio-fuel projects being planned involve sugarcane and sweet sorghum as the main feed-stock for ethanol; and jatropha, castor and other vegetable oil crops such as, coconut, croton and cotton seed 
for biodiesel.
3.5.2 Challenges
1. Insufficient feed-stocks to produce biofuels for blending.
2. Limited research data/information for the use and sustainable production of biofuel.
3. Insufficient legal and institutional framework to support sustainable generation, utilisation, production, 
distribution, supply and use of liquid biofuels.
4. Threat of competition over land use that could lead to food insecurity.
5. Reliance on rain fed, slow maturing feed-stock for biofuels.
6. Inadequate RD&D on alternative biofuel feed-stocks and technologies.
7. Lack of knowledge among the stakeholders on the importance of biofuels for complementing energy 
needs in the country.

3.6 BIOGAS
3.6.1 Background
1. Biogas typically refers to a mixture of gases produced by anaerobic digestion of biodegradable 
materials such as manure, sewage, municipal waste, green waste, plant material, and crops. A 
number of pilot and small commercial biogas facilities for heat and electricity generation have been 
rolled out. These biogas projects have been used to substitute fuel oil in running medium size 
boilers. In 2011 the Ministry of Energy initiated pilot projects for electricity generation from cut flower 
wastes in Kiambu and Kajiado counties with a view to scaling up the generation of electricity from other biogas sources. Tables 10.1 and 10.2 indicates the energy generation potential in the Kenyan 
floriculture and sisal industry (Source REA Master-plan 2009).
2. In an effort to minimize overreliance on biomass the government has put in place incentives to 
promote the use of Biogas. A feasibility study carried out under this initiative established that it is 
possible to construct 6,500 biogas digesters in Kenya every 5 years.
3. Several biogas projects are being undertaken by MoE and REA in public institutions. The private 
sector is also implementing a number of similar initiatives all over the country. 
3.6.2 Challenges
1. Lack of awareness on the potential and benefits of biogas technology.
2. Inadequate RD&D on biogas technologies.
3. High upfront costs of domestic and commercial biogas plant and equipment.
4. Inadequate capacity and skilled biogas contractors in the country.

3.7 SOLAR ENERGY
3.7.1 Background
1. Kenya‘s geographical location astride the equator gives it unique opportunity for a vibrant solar 
energy market. The country receives good solar insolation all year round coupled with moderate to 
high temperatures estimated at 4-6 kWh/m²/day. The percentage of solar energy harnessed for commercial and domestic applications is insignificant relative to the potential. Solar energy can be 
used for lighting, heating, drying and generating electricity.
2. Solar water heating systems are mainly used in homes, hotels, hospitals and learning institutions. As 
of December 2014, a survey to determine the number of installed solar water heating (SWH) units 
was launched. The demand for solar water heating (SWH) is however, projected to grow to more than 
800,000 SWH units by 2020 equivalent to 300,000 TOE. This represents a growth rate of 20% per 
annum. This demand will mainly be from domestic, institutional and small commercial consumers 
spurred by the operationalization of the Energy (Solar Water Heating) Regulations, 2012.
3. Kenya has a large-scale market-driven penetration of small PV systems with capacity of 12 – 50 
watts power (Wp) consisting of low cost amorphous silicon modules and both mono- and 
polycrystalline silicon modules. As at June 2017, the installed capacity for solar energy was at 0.66 
MW. By the year 2020, it is projected that the installed capacity of solar photovoltaic systems will 
reach 100MW generating 220 GWh annually.
4. The Government initiated a programme for electrification of institutions far from grid using solar PV 
systems. As at December 2017 solar PV systems had been installed in 4,685 institutions including 
primary and secondary schools, dispensaries, health and administrative centres.
5. The Government has embarked on a programme to provide solar/wind hybrid generation capacity to 
off-grid diesel power stations as detailed below:

of 114kW3.7.2 Challenges
1. Uncoordinated approach in policy implementation and promotion of solar energy projects.
2. High upfront capital cost for plant and equipment.
3. Weak enforcement of standards and regulations. 
4. Rampant theft of solar photovoltaic panels, which discourages the installation.
5. Lack of awareness on the potential, opportunities and economic benefits offered by solar 
technologies.

3.8 WIND ENERGY
3.8.1 Background
1. Wind energy uses naturally occurring energy of the wind for practical purposes like generating 
electricity, charging batteries, or pumping water. Large, modern wind turbines operate together in 
wind farms to produce electricity for utilities.2. Kenya has a proven wind energy potential of as high as 346 W/m2 and speeds of over 6m/s in parts 
of Marsabit, Kajiado, Laikipia, Meru, Nyandarua, Kilifi, Lamu, Isiolo, Turkana, Samburu, Uasin Gishu, 
Narok, Kiambu Counties among others. The MoE developed a Wind Atlas in 2008 with indicative 
data.
3. To augment the information contained in the Wind Atlas, MoE with the assistance of Development 
Partners, has together with KenGen installed more than 60 wind masts and data loggers in various 
counties across the country to collect site specific data with a view to open up generation electricity 
from wind. Confirmed wind energy potential for selected areas is given in Table 3-1.
4. With the rising cost of oil, exploitation of wind energy has become more attractive. Substitution of 
thermal generation with wind power plants will cut down on the large amounts of foreign exchange 
required to import fossil fuels for the thermal power plants.
5. Further, partial substitution or combining wind with gen-sets (wind–diesel hybrid) and some form of 
renewable energy storage such as pumped storage in hydropower could cut down overall costs by 
substituting renewable energy sources for significant amounts of diesel.
6. Using wind energy to substitute thermal generation will also lead to less CO2 emissions thus 
contributing to reduction in global warming. The carbon credits associated with the reduction of the 
emissions can be sold as certificates of emission reduction.

300MW Lake Turkana Wind power Plant was commissioned in 2017 and delivery of power to the grid 
expected in 2018. Other committed projects include 310MW at Ngong, Kipeto, Prunus, Bahari Wind, 
Ol Danyat and Chania Green. There are proposals for development of 820 MW of wind power at 
Marsabit, Meru, Ngong, Kinangop and Limuru, 
8. Local production and marketing of small wind generators has started and few pilot projects are under 
consideration. However, only a few small and isolated wind generators are in operation so far.
3.8.2 Challenges
1. High upfront costs for wind power generation equipments.
2. High capital investment for transmission lines due to wind power potential areas being far away from 
the grid and load centres. 
3. Inadequate wind regime data.

3.9 MUNICIPAL WASTE
3.9.1 Background
1. Municipal waste consists of solid waste including durable and nondurable goods, containers, food 
scraps, yard waste and inorganic waste from homes, institutions and businesses, wastes generated 
by manufacturing, agriculture, mining, construction and demolition debris, as well as sludge and liquid waste from water and wastewater treatment facilities, septic tanks, sewerage systems, slaughter 
houses.
2. In order of preference, municipal waste can be managed by reduction of its production at source; 
reuse and/or recycling. It can also be managed through responsible dumpling and disposal. In 
addition, waste can be treated to destroy or reprocessed to recover energy or other beneficial 
resources, if the treatment does not threaten public health, safety, or the environment.
3. Most of the municipal waste in Kenya is disposed in poorly managed dump sites, such as the 
Dandora dumpsite, located 8 km from Nairobi‘s Central Business ranked as the largest waste 
disposal pit in the East African region. With appropriate waste-to-energy technologies, municipal 
waste can be used to provide energy while helping to clean the environment.
3.9.2 Challenges
1. Lack of legal and regulatory framework for exploitation.
2. Lack of management and exploitation by the responsible institutions.
3. Inadequate data and information on potential of municipal waste.
4. Lack of incentives for exploitation.

3.10 CO-GENERATION
3.10.1Background
1. Co-generation refers to the simultaneous production of heat and power from one single fuel source. 
It is common where plant processes require both heat and power such as sugar processing and 
offers opportunity for improved energy efficiency besides reducing energy costs and providing an 
additional revenue stream through export of surplus power to the national grid.
2. A pre-feasibility study completed in 2007 by the MoE on cogeneration by sugar companies 
established potential for generating up to 120MW of electricity for export to the national grid with
minor investments and about 200MW with modest investments in terms of expanding cane fields and 
cane crushing capacity.3. Mumias Sugar Company took advantage of its cogeneration potential from sugarcane bagasse by 
installing 38MW capacity out of which 26MW is dedicated to the national grid. Other sugar companies 
are expected to diversify into the use of sugar processing by-product value addition through cogeneration and bioethanol production.
3.10.2Challenges
1. Inefficient plant and equipment in the cogeneration industry.
2. Unreliable and insufficient supply of agro-waste.

3.11 FEED IN TARIFFS
3.11.1 Background
1. A Feed-in-Tariff (FiT) is an instrument to promote the generation of electricity from renewable energy 
sources. It enables a utility to produce Renewable Energy Sources Generated Electricity (RES-E) 
and sell the output to a distributor at a pre-determined tariff for a given period of time.2. The objectives of the FiT Policy are to:
(a) Facilitate resource mobilization by providing investment security and market stability for investors 
in electricity generation from Renewable Energy Sources.
(b) Reduce transaction and administrative costs and delays by eliminating the conventional bidding 
process and lengthy negotiations of PPA.
(c) Encourage private sector investors to operate their plants prudently and efficiently so as to 
maximize returns.
3. The FiT Policy was launched in April 2008 and applied to three technologies namely wind, small 
hydro power and biomass (municipal waste and cane bagasse) for capacities not exceeding 
50MW,10MW and 40MW respectively. A 1st and 2nd Revision were done in 2010 and 2012 
respectively, revising the tariffs, including geothermal and grid connected solar technology and 
Standard PPA Initial submissions from potential investors pointed to generation tariffs higher than the 
FiTs due to increases in the cost of generation equipment and financing. However this trend has 
since changed with some technologies attracting lower tariffs. To benefit from the lower tariffs while 
simultaneously attract investors a review of the FiT tariffs is proposed to provide for the introduction 
of the renewable energy auctions where the industry determines the price for the project through 
competitive bidding. As at 2018 a number of investors had expressed interest to develop projects 
under the FiT policy, including:
(a) 104 small hydropower projects with total capacity of 579.71MW.
(b) 19 wind power projects with total capacity of 898.20MW.
(c) 6 biomass/biogas energy projects with total capacity of 496.09MW.
(d) Solar energy projects with a total capacity of 2,519.40MW.
(e) Geothermal energy projects with a total capacity of 15MW.
4. The existing FiT structure for each technology is as shown in the Table 3.2:

commercialised. These include ocean energy, biomass gasification, bio-refinery technologies and 
concentrating solar power energy storage. Ocean energy possess a high potential owing to the long 
coastline which Kenya is endowed with.
2. The oceans contain huge amounts of power that can be drawn from different sources and exploited 
for generating useful energy. The most developed conversion systems use tidal energy, marine 
currents and ocean waves.

4.1 BACKGROUND
1. Electricity is a secondary source of energy generated through the consumption of primary energy 
sources namely fossil fuels, renewable energy and nuclear energy. By virtue of its versatility in 
application, it is crucial to economic growth and is the most sought after energy service by society. 
Access to electricity is associated with rising or high quality of life.
2. The electricity supply industry (ESI) value chain consists of five elements, as shown below.
3. First, there is generation, requiring both a fuel source (e.g., hydro, geothermal, petroleum or wind 
energy) and a power plant to convert the fuel source into electrical energy.
4. Second, the generated electricity is transformed (stepped up) for transmission over high voltage 
power lines; and matching end user requirements (demand) with energy availability (supply), 
referred to as system operations.
5. The third element is distribution where electricity is transformed again (stepped down) to enable 
delivery or supply of electrical energy to end users or consumers via a vast network of power lines 
and substations.
6. Finally, there is delivery or supply which entails retailing of electrical energy to consumers through a 
series of commercial functions – procuring, pricing, and selling, metering, billing and revenue 
collection.
7. Generation, transmission, system operations and distribution are physical functions, while 
wholesaling and delivery/retailing are merchant or commercial functions.
8. Competition in the industry generally means competition in the generation of electricity, as well as in 
the commercial functions. The transportation (transmission and distribution) as well as system 
operation functions are natural monopolies as it does not make economic, environmental or 
aesthetic sense to build multiple sets of competing systems in any one area. System operations is 
also non-competitive, since the system operator has to control all the plants in a control area, 
otherwise the system would not function efficiently or safely.
9. The ESI in Kenya has been undergoing reforms and restructuring since the mid-90s with the aims 
of, inter alia:
(a) Creating appropriate legal, regulatory and institutional framework for the industry.
(b) Ensuring provision of affordable, reliable, efficient and sustainable power supplies.
(c) Increasing the population‘s access to electricity so as to stimulate economic growth.
(d) Improving the efficiency of power distribution and supply through reductions in system losses 
and enhancement of collection of revenues.(e) Creating a more competitive market structure with clear definition of roles for public and 
private sector players in generation, transmission, distribution and retail functions.
4.2 ELECTRIC POWER EXPANSION PLANNING
1. The Energy Act, No 12 of 2006 assigned responsibility for development of indicative national energy 
plans to the Energy Regulatory Commission. In 2009, the Commission established a committee 
responsible for carrying out medium to long term planning of the electric power sub-sector through 
the annual 20 year rolling Least Cost Power Development Plan (LCPDP). Up to year 2011, the 
LCPDP was being reviewed annually. Currently, the plan is updated every two years, the latest 
update having been undertaken in 2018.
2. The LCPDP identifies existing potential in generation, possible investments in transmission, forecasts 
future power demand and how best it can be met at least cost. The process entails three key 
aspects:
(a) Load forecasting – Comprises review of load forecast assumptions, variables, historical data set 
and methodology taking cognizance of the future macro-economy.
(b) Generation Planning – Involves the review and update of the power system simulation data 
including plant types, system constraints and costs.
(c) Transmission Planning - Involves power system transmission simulation to ensure the system 
is well balanced.
3. Planning of the distribution system is carried out by the national entities responsible for distribution 
and rural electrification. These plans form inputs to the LCPDP, particularly with regard to the load 
forecast.
4.3 DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY
1. As at 2017, electricity provided 9% of overall energy requirements in Kenya, while petroleum and 
renewable energy provided 22% and 69%, respectively. Demand for electricity has shown an upward 
trend since 2007 due to accelerated economic growth. Peak demand increased from 1,044MW in FY 
2007/08 to 1,656MW in FY2016/17 while the number of electricity consumers more than trebled from 
1,060,383 in FY 2007/08 to 6,182,292 by June 2017 as detailed in Table 4.2.
2. Peak demand is projected to grow from 1,812MW as at July 2018 to 2,421 MW by 2022 and to 2,989,
MW by 2025 and 4,244MW by 2030. To meet this demand, an additional 5,000 MW of new 
generation is to be developed to bring total installed capacity to at least 6,652MW by 2024. Annual 
energy consumption is projected to increase from 8,272GWh in 2016/17 to 14,334GWh in 2021/22. 
3. Major drivers of the demand include industrial parks, LAPPSET projects, resort cities, iron and steel 
smelting industry, the standard gauge railway and the light rail.
4. As at 30th June 2017,73.5% of the population was connected to electricity compared to only 15% at 
30th June 2004. The national electricity distribution network as at 2016/17 was1,212km of 66kV lines, 
30,846km of 33kV lines and 37,234km of 11kV. The existing medium voltage (66kV,33 kV and 11 kV) 
distribution lines cover areas in which about 63% of Kenya‘s population of 40 million live.Table 4.2 Demand and Consumer Statistics

4.4 ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION
4.4.1 Background
1. Electricity generation in Kenya is liberalised with several licensed electric power producers whose 
combined installed capacity was 2,336MW as at June 2017. These include KenGen which accounts 
for approximately 70% of the installed capacity, and eight (8) Independent Power Producers (IPPs) 
which account for the balance. In the FY ended 30th June 2017, 78.79% of the electrical energy was 
generated using renewable energy sources while 21.21 % was generated using fossil fuels as 
detailed in Table 4.3.

1. It is anticipated that electricity demand will rise sharply as new County Governments take shape and 
numerous economic activities spring up in the counties. In particular, energy intensive activities such 
as mining, production of iron and steel products from local iron ore deposits, irrigation of large tracts 
of land for food security and agro-based industry. Other such activities include; operation of 
petroleum pipelines for both crude and refined fuel oils, petrochemicals production including urea, 
steel products based manufacturing, such as motor vehicle body parts and for earth moving
equipment, electrification of designated rail lines, installation of escalators at shopping malls and 
airports, and new economic zones.
2. In order to provide affordable electricity for these activities which are expected to transform our 
economy, a roadmap to increase the installed generation capacity from 1664MW as at October 2013 
by at least 5000MW to 6,652 MW by 2024 has been proposed and is being implemented. Through 
this plan the Government will in the medium to long term commit itself to development of
technologies that result to least cost based on technology of screening curves. The screening curves 
take into account the elements of capacity factor, capital and discount rates. As at December, 2017, 
the installed capacity had reached 2,336 MW.
3. This capacity will mainly be developed from an energy mix of Geothermal 1,646MW, Natural Gas 
1,050MW, Wind 630MW and Coal 1,920MW through IPPs under the PPP framework. Table 4.4 
below show the new generation capacity additions and cumulative installed capacities for the period 
of 2017-2024.

respective load centres at an estimated cost of KShs 50 billion to be funded by GOK over the period 
between 2017-2024 so as to unlock over KShs 800 billion of new investment in power generation by 
the private sector. The developers of these power plants will be expected to negotiate and execute 
power purchase agreements with KPLC which shall remain the single buyer during the project period.
4.4.3 Generation from Renewable Energy Resources
Generation of electrical energy using renewable energy resources is dealt with in Chapter 3.
4.4.4 Thermal Power Generation
1. Thermal power plants generate electrical energy using fossil fuels, mainly, petroleum, natural gas and 
coal.
2. Thermal generation accounts for approximately 34.4% of installed capacity and its contribution to the 
actual energy mix as at June 2017 was approximately 21.21%. The installed thermal capacity is 
802.56MW.
3. All thermal generating plants are run on imported petroleum fuels which are subject to volatile 
international oil market prices which are passed through to consumers. Consumption of petroleum is 
projected progressively reduce and be replaced by natural gas.
4. Thermal power generation:
(a) Requires a relatively shorter period of between 12 to 18 months.
(b) Requires smaller physical space compared to hydro and geothermal power plants.
(c) Lower capital cost compared to hydro power and geothermal power plants.
(d) Can be installed in any part of the country as compared to hydro power and geothermal plants 
which are site specific.
(e) Attractive to private investment due to faster return on investment
4.4.5 Challenges
(a) Inadequate infrastructure for power supply in the locality of generation plants.
(b) Reliance on fossil fuel leading to high electricity costs.
(c) Underdevelopment of the immerse potential of renewable energy for power generation.
(d) Thermal power generation causes environmental pollution which requires costly mitigation 
measures.
(e) High price volatility of petroleum products affecting electricity generation cost.
(f) Thermal power plants have a relatively short life span.
(g) Stringent emergency power plan conditions.
(h) Thermal power plants have relatively lower conversion efficiencies of less than 50% compared to 
hydropower plants which have over 90% efficiency.4.4.6 Policies and Strategies

4.4.7 Nuclear Energy - Electricity Generation 
4.4.7.1 Background
1. The uptake of nuclear power has been growing over time across the world. Various countries without 
existing nuclear power plants in their energy mix have expressed interest in investing in nuclear 
electricity generation, while developed countries with existing nuclear plants have been expanding 
their capacities. All over the world, as of June 2017, there were 451 nuclear power plants in operation
and 55 under construction and 230 are in the planning stage as detailed in Table 10.3.
2. Vision 2030 notes the need for reliable and affordable electricity for the ever increasing commercial, 
industrial and household use. The critical need for nuclear energy is premised on the fact that, with 
the rising demand for power in the country due to the accelerated investment in the economy, it is 
one of the forms of energy that can produce enormous amounts of electricity at a relatively 
economical cost
3. In April 2010, the National Economic and Social Council (NESC) proposed the introduction of nuclear 
electricity into the Kenyan energy mix as a national priority leading to the formation of the 13 member 
Nuclear Electricity Project Committee (NEPC) under the Ministry of Energy. In November 2012, the 
Kenya Nuclear Electricity Board was established vide Legal Notice 131 of 2012 effectively becoming 
the successor to NEPC to fast track the development of generation of electricity using nuclear 
energy. 4. Nuclear energy across the world elicits varied reactions in relation to plant safety, management or 
radioactive waste management and proliferation concerns in the wake of heightened nuclear 
incidents. It is important to note that the international nuclear industry through comprehensive R D&D
has substantially addressed most of the concerns and challenges that traditionally undermined 
nuclear energy as a form of economical and safe energy. This can be evidenced by long and safe 
operation of nuclear power plants. In fact, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was 
awarded the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize in 2005 for ‘its efforts in preventing nuclear energy from 
being used for military purposes and most importantly for ensuring that nuclear energy for peaceful 
purposes is used in the safest possible way.
5. Kenya has adopted the internationally recommended IAEA Milestone Approach in development of its 
nuclear power programme. The Milestone Approach is a phased, guided and systematic 
methodology which assesses all nuclear infrastructure issues at every single stage of development. 
Figure 10.1 in 10.0 - Annexures illustrates the activities under each milestone
6. The first nuclear plant of 1,000MW is expected to be commissioned in 2027. Additional units of 
1,000MW each are expected to be commissioned in 2030, 2033, and 2035. It is further noted that 
the introduction of nuclear plants into the grid is justified by the demand for electricity within the 
Eastern Africa Power Pool (EAPP).
4.4.7.2 Advantages
1. Nuclear plants are some of the most cost effective sources of generating electricity.
2. It is a clean non- pollutant way to generate electricity as it does not produce any GHG emissions.
3. Uranium which is the fuel used in nuclear power plants is abundantly available as it‘s a natural 
resource. Uranium deposits are not exhaustible for an estimated 1,000 years worldwide.
4. Nuclear power is a reliable source of power with an economic life of 70 years with an option of 
extension of up to 20 years.
5. Nuclear power is suitable for base load operation.
6. Nuclear fuel can be recycled and re-used. This approach would capture the vast amount of energy 
still remaining in the spent nuclear fuel and reduce on radioactive waste.
7. Nuclear power plants have one of the highest conversion factors with a sustained plant efficiency of 
up to 98%.
8. In comparison with other forms of energy such as solar and wind, nuclear energy utilizes less land. A 
site area comparison of the various forms of energy reveals that for a 1,000MW capacity plant, 
nuclear energy requires 330,000m², solar 33,000,000m² and wind 165,000,000m².
4.4.7.3 Challenges
1. Nuclear plants require high upfront capital cost.
2. Nuclear reactors yield products that could be diverted and turned into atomic weapons.
3. Nuclear waste is highly radioactive and non biodegradable.4. Globally, there is no safe and environmentally acceptable standards for disposal of radioactive and 
chemical nuclear waste
5. Nuclear accidents are catastrophic as experienced in Chernobyl, Ukraine (1986) and Fukushima, 
Japan (2011) hence no guarantee on safety.
6. Negative public perceptions on nuclear power plants. 
4.4.7.4 Mitigating factors
1. Some of the measures to mitigate the challenges include:
(a) Comprehensive nuclear laws, regulations and treaties, in reactor designs, operator training, 
public awareness, emergency preparedness, enhanced safety, additional safeguards and 
security standards. All these have greatly reduced probability of occurrence of nuclear accidents 
and negative impact on public environment, health and safety.
(b) New reactor types have been designed to make it physically impossible to melt down. This is 
due to elaborate regulations on safety and security safeguards, in design, setting up and 
operating nuclear plants.
(c) Development of small and medium sized reactors (SMRs) provides an attractive and affordable 
nuclear power option for many developing countries with small electrical grids, insufficient 
infrastructure and limited investment capability. Multi-module power plants with SMRs may offer 
energy production flexibility that energy market deregulation might call for in future in many 
countries. SMRs are also of particular interest for co-generation and many advanced future 
process heat applications. Some SMRs designs reduce obligations of the user for spent fuel and 
waste management and offer greater non-proliferation assurances to the international 
community.
(d) Heightened vigilance by the IAEA and the international community has ensured recent nuclear
energy research; development and use are increasingly for peaceful purposes and not military 
use.

4.5 ELECTRIC POWER TRANSMISSION
4.5.1 Background
1. Kenya‘s existing transmission network comprises of 4,766 circuit km at 132 kV and above voltage 
levels as at June 2017. This comprises of 585 km of 400kV lines, 374.59 km of 220 kV lines and 
839.11 km of 132 kV lines.
2. As at 30th June 2017, Kenya has Thirty-eight (38) generation substations with a generation capacity 
of 10,204.85GWh and transmission substations with a capacity of 4,787 MVA.
3. The existing transmission system capacity is severely constrained particularly during peak hours. 
The problem is partly due to inadequate reactive power in major load centres and also transmission 
constraints particularly in the Western and Nairobi regions.4. One of the recommendations under Sessional Paper No. 4 of 2004 on Energy was to unbundle 
transmission and distribution functions. This began in 2008 with the establishment of KETRACO as a 
transmission entity. These two functions were being performed exclusively by KPLC who owned, 
operated and maintained the national transmission and distribution network.
4.5.2 Extension of the National Transmission Network
1. KETRACO is currently undertaking new transmission projects aimed at developing a robust grid 
system to:-
(a) Enable evacuation of electric power from various generation plants and injecting it to the national 
grid.
(b) Improve quality and reliability of electricity supply throughout the country by ensuring adequate 
evacuation capacity.
(c) Develop new transmission lines comprising of about 5,000km in the short term and 16,000km by 
2031.
(d) Reduce the cost of electricity to the consumer by absorbing the capital cost of transmission lines 
since they will be fully funded by the National Government.
(e) Provide interconnection links with the neighbouring countries in order to facilitate power 
exchange and develop electricity trade in the region.
(f) Reduce system losses.
(g) Open up off-grid areas in order to ease connectivity to electricity by constructing transmission 
lines to link them up to the national grid.
2. As earlier stated, the numerous economic activities springing up in the counties require a 
corresponding increase in generation capacity and transmission network. Consequently, the number 
of transmission lines projected for construction in the next 5 years needs to be substantial to meet 
this need.
3. The LCPDP of 2018 has identified 10,000 km transmission line as priority projects for 
implementation. These projects include 2,650km of 132kV lines, 2,700km of 220kV lines, 2,000km 
400kV lines and 612km of 500kV HVDC lines. The projects fall into four broad categories based on 
their specific objectives, namely:
(a)System strengthening projects
These Projects will improve capacity to transfer electrical energy and address the challenge of 
low voltages, high transmission losses, unreliability of supply and network security.
(b) Power evacuation projects
The projects target evacuation of power from various generation plants for injection into the 
national grid. 
(c) Regional interconnectors
The Government has entered into partnerships through which regional power integration is 
being spearheaded in order to facilitate regional trade. (d)Electricity access projects
The projects in this category fall under the Energy Scale - Up Programme and their main 
objective is to increase electricity access and address the challenges of access and low 
connectivity.
4. It is projected that by 2031 16,000 km of transmission lines and associated substations will have 
been constructed. Figure 4.4 shows the development of the Kenya transmission network as at June 
2017.
Figure 4.4 – Development of the Kenya Transmission Network5. As the transmission network expands through the various institutions as a result of increased 
generation, it would be necessary to ensure evacuation and uptake of that generation by consumers. 
This is presently done through power purchase agreements between KPLC as the off-taker and 
generators. With liberalisation of the energy sector careful implementation of an open access system 
in transmission should be given due consideration to safeguard the existing obligations.
4.5.3 Regional Interconnection
4.5.3.1 Imports and Exports
1. The Kenyan transmission network is interconnected with Uganda‘s system through a 132 kV double 
circuit transmission line. The arrangement allows for electrical energy exchange between the two 
systems. Kenya also has cross-border agreements with Tanzania and Ethiopia. Quantities of imports 
and exports of electrical energy (in kWhs) between Kenya and Uganda as well as between Kenya 
and Tanzania are detailed in Table 4.5.

6. Resulting from the ongoing regional integration under the EAPP initiative and the need to build 
synergies in the region in power development, the Government has committed to enter into mutually 
beneficial regional interconnections with other African countries. As a result, the regional power 
market is progressively evolving into a power pool with the anticipated interconnections with Ethiopia, 
Tanzania and the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP) countries and strengthening of the 
interconnection with Uganda. Table 4.6 details planned regional inter-connectors.

4.6 ELECTRIC POWER DISTRIBUTION
4.6.1 Background
1. Distribution entails movement of electrical energy from power plants and/or from the transmission 
system through distribution networks comprising electric supply lines and distribution substations to 
consumers. Participants in the distribution function include:
(a) Distribution licensees authorised to design, construct, operate and maintain distribution systems. 
As at 2018, KPLC is the distribution licensee in most parts of Kenya.
(b) Rural Electrification Authority, which carries out grid extension at medium and low voltage in areas 
which are considered uneconomic for electrification by the licensee.
(c) County Governments that have the function of county planning and development, including 
electricity and gas reticulation and energy regulation. Consequently, they will work in 
collaboration with REA and distribution licensees to enhance connectivity in the country.
2. As at June 2017, just about 73.5% of the population had access to electricity. In addition to those set 
out in Table 4.2 and Table 4.3, other key statistics about the electricity supply industry are 
summarised in Table 4.7.

Source: KPLC Annual Report 2016/20174.6.2 Distribution System
1. As at 30th June 2017, the distribution system comprised of 1,212 km of 66 kV lines, 30,846 km of 33 
kV lines, 37,234 km of 11kV lines and low voltage lines, primary distribution substations with 
transformation capacity of 4,416MVA and distribution transformers with total capacity of 7,276MVA.
2. It is projected that by 2020, capacities of primary and distribution substations, HV lines and MV lines 
are projected to be 11,888MVA, 190, 204MVA, 7,925km and 118,875km respectively. In the year 
2030 the estimates of the distribution substation capacity, distribution transformer capacity, HV lines 
and MV lines will be 37,565MVA, 60,104MVA, 25,043 km and 187,825 km respectively.
3. As the distribution network expands through the various institutions as a result of increased 
generation and enhanced transmission, it would be necessary to ensure efficient distribution and 
supply of electric energy to consumers. 
4. The devolved structure in the energy sector calls for careful implementation of an open access 
system in distribution while safeguarding the existing obligations. 
4.6.3 Rural Electrification
1. The Rural Electrification Schemes Programme (the Programme) was initiated in 1973 with the 
objective of providing electricity supply to areas considered economically unviable by the distribution 
licensee. The Programme was implemented by KPLC until 2007 when the Government established 
the Rural Electrification Authority (REA) under section 66 of the Energy Act, No.12 of 2006 to be the 
lead agency under the Programme. The mandate of REA includes accelerating the pace of rural 
electrification by managing the Rural Electrification Programme Fund (REP Fund), developing rural 
electrification master plans, mobilizing resources for rural electrification as well as promoting the 
development and use of renewable energy.
2. By June 2016, 88,581 public facilities in the country out of which 60,617 were electrified (68.4%) 
under the Programme and 27,964 were un-electrified (31.6%). The un-electrified public facilities will
be electrified through the grid extension and renewable energy options such as installation of solar 
PV systems in the off grid areas. There has been accelerated connectivity of rural customers which 
have increased from 133,047 in 2007 to 1,269,510 in 2017. 
3. The cumulative capital expenditure since inception of the Programme is at Kshs. 96 billion as at June 
2017. The units of electricity sold under the rural electrification schemes customers increased by 12
million kWh (an increase of 2.2%) from 537million kWh in 2015/16 to 549 million kWh in 2016/17.
4. Towards the promotion of renewable energy, the Government through REA is presently implementing 
a 54MW solar power plant project situated in Garissa County and plant is to be commissioned in 
2018. In addition, REA is implementing 25No. Solar PV/Diesel Hybrid Mini Grid power projects at 
various sites country wide. The projects are expected to be commissioned in 2018.
4.6.4 Cross Border Electrification
1. Cross border electrification (CBE) is the extension of the medium and low voltage distribution 
networks from one country to supply communities and load centres in a neighbouring country in 
situations where those communities and load centres are far from distribution systems within their 
own country. Areas that have benefitted from CBE include Lunga Lunga and Vanga in Kenya supplied from Tanzania, Namanga in Tanzania supplied from Kenya and Moyale in Kenya supplied 
from Ethiopia.
2. CBE is implemented by electricity supply licensees and rural electrification authorities of the member 
states. It can enhance electricity trade between countries and facilitate increased access to power 
supply in a cost-effective manner in border regions where distribution systems exist across borders 
within the Eastern Africa Region.
3. Challenges to CBE include different legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks, technical 
standards, quality of supply and service levels, tariffs and tariff structures among the countries in the 
Region.
4.6.5 Reliability and Quality of Supply
1. It is acknowledged that the reliability and quality of supply has a direct bearing on competitiveness of 
the country as these directly impact on the cost of production. Electricity consumers continue to 
demand more reliability and better quality of service commensurate with the tariffs they pay, though
the service they receive is below their expectations. KPLC maintains data on reliability and quality of 
supply that provide the following statistics:
(a) Number of high and low voltage interruptions.
(b) Number of transformer failures.
(c) Number of low voltage breakdowns.
(d) Average repair time following interruption of supply.
(e) Cumulative number of customers.
(f) Quantity of electrical energy purchased and sold.
2. These statistics are not a sufficient measure of the reliability and quality of supply. While it is 
appreciated that efforts are being made to improve reliability and quality of supply, it is important to 
track and monitor these aspects using internationally accepted indicators such as System Average 
Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI), System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) and 
Customer Average Interruption Duration Index (CAIDI).
3. In the generation part of the electricity supply chain, plant availability factors are the indicators of 
reliability of supply.
4.6.6 Connection to Electricity Supply
1. Towards socio-economic transformation of the country, the Government has set a target of universal 
access to electricity by 2020. Electricity access is a critical element that is necessary in a country‘s 
economic growth. It is particularly crucial to human development, as certain basic activities—such as 
lighting, refrigeration, running household appliances, and operating equipment; cannot easily be 
carried out by other forms of energy. Sustainable provision of electricity can free large amounts of 
time and labour and promote better health and education.
2. As at June 2017, 73.5% of the population had access to electricity. A study commissioned by the 
Ministry of Energy and Petroleum in 2014 established that Kenya has one of the highest connection 
charges leading to low access to electricity supply. Despite the successful electrification of public facilities in rural areas, neighbouring households largely remain unconnected. Consequently the 
Government is currently implementing the Last Mile Connectivity Project funded by exchequer and 
Donors.
3. Going by the current pace at which connections are being effected, particularly by the achievement of 
73.5% access to electricity by 2017. The country is on course to achieve universal access by 2020. 
This would not have been possible without a paradigm shift in the electrification strategy.
4.6.7 Challenges in Distribution
1. Vandalism of electric power infrastructure.
2. Lengthy process of way-leaves acquisition.
3. Encroachment of way-leaves trace.
4. Weak distribution network characterized by limited redundancy and aging 
5. Frequent and prolonged supply interruptions.
6. High cost of conversion of overhead to underground distribution networks.
7. High distribution system losses.
8. Illegal power line connections and theft of electricity.
9. Physical plans in most cases do not provide an infrastructure corridor for electricity reticulation.
10. High arbitrary levies charged by the public institutions on electric power infrastructure.
11. Lack of a framework and synergies in adoption of parallel system in off-take of power (parallel 
systems being single and multiple off-taker)
12. Scattered nature of homes in rural areas.
13. High costs of rural electrification projects.
14. Lack of adherence to technical standards.
15. High electricity connection charges.
16. Majority of consumers cannot afford upfront connection costs.

4.7 RETAIL OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY
4.7.1 Background
1. Retailing of electricity entails delivery or supply of electrical energy to consumers through a series of 
commercial functions i.e. procuring, pricing, selling, metering, billing and revenue collection.
2. Delivery and retailing of electricity is a merchant or commercial function as opposed to generation, 
transmission and distribution which are of physical nature.
3. The retail function is currently exclusively undertaken by KPLC. Based on this, KPLC has continued 
to be the single buyer of electricity signing Power Purchase Agreements with generators of electrical energy. This energy is sold by KPLC to all customers including those connected under the Rural 
Electrification Programme.
4. As at 30th June 2017, the total unit sales which include all connected customers (6,182,282) were 
8,272 million kilowatt hours as detailed in Table 4.2.
4.7.2 Challenges in Retail of Electrical Energy

2. High cost to acquire land and way-leaves for power infrastructure development.
3. Delays in decision making in public energy sector due to complicated corporate governance 
structures.
4. High cost of financing energy infrastructure projects.
5. Insufficient fiscal and other incentives for private sector investment.
6. Delayed implementation of power generation projects from cheaper energy resources including coal 
and natural gas to support power generation.

  5.0 – ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CONSERVATION
5.1 BACKGROUND
1. Energy efficiency and conservation refers to measures aimed at reducing energy consumption 
without sacrificing productivity or increasing costs. Energy efficiency and conservation measures 
have the potential to scale down capital investments needed to provide additional supplies and 
reduce overall resource use. It also has the potential of reducing cost of production at the end user 
level.
2. Energy efficiency and conservation reduces energy demand, improves energy security, improves 
competitiveness and helps to mitigate climate change by lowering GHG emissions.
3. A number of factors have highlighted the importance of, and urgency for, energy efficiency and 
conservation:
(a) High energy prices – the continuing increase in the price of energy has significantly contributed to 
increased interest in energy efficiency and conservation.
(b) Insecurity of supply – expressed in the growing discomfort about the vulnerability and uncertainty 
of future energy supplies as well as the volatility of their prices.
(c) Adverse environmental and health impacts – there is increasing concern about spiralling 
degradation of the environment as exemplified by increased local air pollution and acid 
precipitation from ever growing fossil fuel combustion. Associated with this are global issues 
such as climate change as a result of GHG emissions.
(d) Depletion of energy resources – there is growing unease at the rate of depletion of major energy 
resources. The most used energy resources such as fuel wood and fossil fuels are becoming 
scarce as demand rises.
4. From the consumer‘s point of view, energy efficiency and conservation measures yield direct savings 
on the energy bill. From the national stand point, adoption of such measures would significantly 
reduce the foreign exchange costs of oil imports. It would also serve to defer additional investment in 
power generation capacity. Ultimately, improved energy efficiency would boost the competitiveness 
of Kenyan products owing to reduced input costs.
5. The United Nations Development Programme Global Environmental Facility-Kenya Association of 
Manufacturers (UNDP-GEF-KAM) Industrial Energy Efficiency Project report of 2005 revealed that 
wastage of primary energy input ranged from 10% to 30%. This was attributed to a lack of 
information, motivation, know-how and financial restrictions in adopting emerging energy efficiency 
and conservation technologies and innovations.
6. The UNDP-GEF – KAM Project ended in 2005. Thereafter, the MoE and the Kenya Association of 
Manufacturers signed a Memorandum of Agreement to establish a Centre for Energy Efficiency and 
Conservation (CEEC). The CEEC picked-up from where the GEF-KAM project had ended; mainly to 
undertake on behalf of the Ministry – energy audits in mainstream industries, small and medium 
enterprises (SMEs) and public institutions, capacity building in energy efficiency and conservation, 
public education and awareness activities as well as administer the Energy Management Awards 
(EMA) annual events. Further to this, the Energy Management Regulations were enacted in 2012 by ERC. The total energy audits undertaken on behalf of the MoE under the Regulations are 975 
indicating a saving potential of KShs. 9.8 billion and 389,690MWh equivalent. 
7. It is expected that with continued efforts through the CEEC and the private sector, it is possible to 
avoid cumulative emissions of CO2 to the tune of 7.0 million tonnes by the end of year 2016, 
equivalent to more than 20,000GWh in energy savings. 
5.2 CHALLENGES
1. Inadequate awareness and sensitization of the benefits accruing from energy efficiency and 
conservation.
2. Low uptake of energy efficiency and conservation technologies, appliances and standards.
3. High technical losses in the generation, transmission and distribution systems.
4. Limited technical capacity, training and expertise in energy management, efficiency and
conservation.
5. Lack of comprehensive, reliable energy consumption audit data and information covering various 
sectors.
6. Slow adoption of conservation opportunities and measures due to socio-economic factors.
7. High upfront cost for energy efficiency and conservation projects.
8. Insufficient standards of energy efficiency and conservation equipment and appliances.
9. Lack of tax rebates and fiscal incentives for energy efficiency and conservation equipment and 
appliances.
10. Low awareness of existing fiscal, and legal, incentives, for generation plants, equipment and 
infrastructure.
11. Low awareness of the existence of credit facilities such as green energy facility grants and loans and 
carbon credit from the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).

  6.0 – LAND, ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH AND SAFETY
6.1 BACKGROUND
1. Land is a critical resource in the development of energy and petroleum infrastructure. However, due 
to competing interest in land utilization, the sector faces challenges in developing its infrastructure.
2. Environmental Management in the energy and petroleum sector is key to ensuring sustainability in 
the energy value chain. Energy generation, transmission and use pose various dangers to human life 
and the environment. The challenge for players in the energy sector is the provision of affordable, 
competitive, reliable and sustainable energy whilst upholding people‘s rights to land, environment, 
health and safety
3. The Environmental Management and Co-ordination Act, No. 8 of 1999 (EMCA, 1999) is the umbrella 
legal framework in respect to environmental management in Kenya. Its implementing agency is the 
National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA). It recognises a ―Lead Agency‖ as any 
Government institution in which any law vests functions of control or management of any element of 
the environment or natural resource. Lead Agencies therefore play an important role in enforcing 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations.
4. The Energy Regulatory Commission is a key ―Lead Agency‖ in the energy sector, drawing its powers 
from the Energy Act No. 12 of 2006 to ―inter alia… formulate, enforce and review environmental, 
health, safety and quality standards for the energy sector, in coordination with other statutory 
authorities‖. The Act also requires that while reviewing applications for licences in the energy sector, 
ERC to consider, among others, the environmental and social impacts and compliance with EMCA 
1999
5. A Strategic Environmental Assessment is required for public plans and programmes to identify and 
minimize any negative environmental impacts. Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations 
require that mitigating measures be put in place to minimise the adverse impact of energy projects. 
Comprehensive environmental impact assessments are conducted for all projects prior to their 
implementation to ascertain the level of potential environmental damage, the required mitigation 
measures and associated costs.
6. Other authorities that have regulatory mandate in the energy sector in terms of environment, health 
and safety are the Directorate of Occupational Safety and Health Services (DOSHS) under the 
Occupational Safety and Health Act of 2007, Water Resources Management Authority (WRMA) 
under the Water Act of 2002 and the Kenya Maritime Authority (KMA) under the Merchant Shipping 
Act & Kenya Maritime Authority Act of 2006.
7. Vision 2030 acknowledges that land is a vital factor of production in the economy together with its 
aesthetic, cultural and traditional values. Some key initiatives envisioned to address environmental 
problems which relate to the energy sector are:
(a) Sustainable management of natural resources.
(b) Pollution and waste management.
(c) Disaster risk management.
(d) Use of incentives for environmental compliance.8. The Constitution provides for protection of the right to property. Energy sector players, to whom land 
access and utilization is critical in their operations, must be alive to this fact. In addition, Article 42 of 
the Constitution provides for every person‘s right to a clean and healthy environment. The 
Constitution also provides that sustainable development is one of the values and principles of 
governance which bind all State organs, officials and any person implementing public policy.
9. The trans-boundary impact of environmental pollutants has necessitated international cooperation in 
order to prevent, minimise and mitigate pollution. A substantial portion of the risks arise from 
operations in the energy sector, amongst them construction of generation, transmission and 
distribution infrastructure, disposal of hazardous waste, handling and management of radioactive 
materials. Several multilateral environmental agreements/treaties have been developed globally with 
Kenya ratifying and domesticating a number of them. The Constitution provides that any treaty or 
convention ratified by Kenya forms part of the Laws of Kenya. It is necessary to develop guidelines 
to ensure the application and compliance of the relevant conventions in the energy sector.
6.2 SUPPLY SIDE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS
6.2.1 Coal Midstream
Concerns in the coal industry include emissions which contribute to global warming, acid rain and 
degradation of environment, among others. However, modern technologies among them the Clean 
Coal Technology (CCT) can be applied to reduce pollution significantly. Clean coal energy can be 
harnessed chemically without combustion with air by capturing 99% of Carbon Dioxide.
6.2.2 Renewable Energy
1. Generally, renewable energy is considered an environmentally friendly option for energy 
development. However, some concerns exist raising the need for mitigation measures to be 
incorporated in projects to ensure minimal impact and sustainability.
6.2.2.1 Geothermal
1. Geothermal power generation involves drawing fluids at high temperature from deep in the earth. 
These fluids carry a mixture of gases and liquids which may contribute to global warming, acid rain, 
noxious smells and ground water pollution if released on the surface.
2. To mitigate these, the plants are equipped with emission control systems to reduce the exhaust. In 
addition, the practice of re-injecting the fluids into the earth for disposal and stimulation of reservoir 
also help to reduce environmental risk. Other mitigation measures include extraction of products for 
industrial use.
6.2.2.2 Large Hydro
1. The major concern for hydros is the displacement of people and wildlife where a reservoir is located. 
Large reservoirs result in submersion of extensive areas upstream, destroying ecologically rich and 
productive land, riverine valley forests, marshland and grass land.
2. Dams also have an impact on aquatic ecosystems both upstream and downstream by disrupting the 
reproductive cycle of, e.g., fish whose spawning grounds are normally upstream. Submerged 
vegetation decomposes anaerobically producing methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Other risks of 
hydros include dam failure which may be caused by sabotage, or structural failures, and siltation. Appropriate mitigation measures should be adopted to counter these and other potential negative 
effects.
6.2.2.3 Biomass
1. A supply-demand imbalance in the use of biomass has negative environmental impact in the form of 
deforestation. It has been established that charcoal production leads to the depletion of woodlands in 
Kenya. This is mainly because of use of inefficient charcoal kilns. In addition, the cost of the raw 
material (e.g. tree replacement) is generally not considered and the wood is regarded as a free good.
6.2.3 Electricity
1. The construction and operation of electricity infrastructure have a direct impact on the quality of the 
environment either by the emission or discharge of pollutants, poor waste handling, or by changing 
the ecological systems. The degree of pollution and other ecological impacts are dependent upon the 
nature of the technology in use as well as the size and the general location of the plant.
2. A health and safety concern with electricity grid systems and consumer installations is the danger of 
electrocution and electric shocks. As result of this, available data for 2017 from ERC indicates that 
there has been 134 accidents/incidents out of which 88 were fatalities and 59 were personal injuries
related to electrical accidents.
6.2.4 Nuclear Energy
1. The global, traditional challenge of nuclear energy remains the management of radioactive waste. 
However, as a result of continued research in the area, radioactive waste management is now well 
within manageable levels. Spent fuel rods can either be safely stored until the radioactive levels 
reduce to non-toxic levels or be reprocessed and reused in generation of nuclear energy. The waste 
also requires special handling and storage facilities to reduce the risk of exposure to employees, the 
public and the environment.
2. A nuclear meltdown may cause release of radioactive materials which can have a negative impact to 
environment, health and safety of persons. However, further research has led to development of 
advanced reactors with enhanced security and safety mechanisms that greatly diminish the 
possibility of nuclear accidents.
6.3 DEMAND SIDE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS
1. Solid fuels or biomass fuels are less efficient than oil, natural gas or propane. It takes larger 
quantities of wood, peat or coal to produce the same amount of energy and they produce larger 
quantities of smoke when they burn. Solid fuels produce less heat for the amount of fuel consumed 
and produce more pollution. This is described as the energy ladder.Figure: 6.1 - The Energy Pyramid1- Efficiency of Solid Fuel compared to other fuels
2. The solid fuels lead to increased indoor air pollution which leads to Upper Respiratory Tract Infections 
(URTI). The challenge is to move consumers up the energy ladder recognising that biomass, which 
is at the bottom of energy ladder. As at 2017 Biomass contribution to Kenya‘s final energy demand is 
at 69%.
3. Kerosene is widely used in households for lighting and cooking. In 2017 about 448 thousand cubic 
metres were used, up from 372 thousand cubic metres consumed in 2016. However, this causes 
indoor air pollution leading to cases of URTI, in addition to the risk of explosions of lamps and stoves 
leading to injuries, loss of lives and property. There is need to move consumers from the 
consumption of kerosene to efficient renewable energy solutions like LPG or natural gas and 
electricity.
6.4 CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES
1. Kenya is a signatory of the Kyoto Protocol, a treaty signed in 1997, to lower anthropogenic emissions 
of Carbon Dioxide (CO2). However, Kenya is not among the Annex I countries, which have emission 
reduction targets since its emissions are low as seen in Table 6.1 which compares emissions from 
developed (Annex I) countries and MDCs and LDCs. However, under the protocol, there are 
opportunities to benefit by selling Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) through the Clean 
Development Mechanism (CDM).

2. Kenya also ratified the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC) on 28th December 2016. Climate change action in Kenya is guided by the 
Climate Change Act of 2016 and the National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP) 2018-2022. 
Kenya, in its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted to the UNFCCC in 2016, 
undertook to abate greenhouse gas emissions by 30% (140MtCO2e) by 2030.
3. The NDC Sector Analysis Report 2018 examined the energy sector and identified the prioritized 
actions and their mitigation potential as shown in Table 6.2 below.

5. With these investments, on a scale of between 100 points (highest) and 0 points (lowest) Kenya is 
rated to have an ‗adequate‘ climate for CDM investment. It however needs to move from 
‗Satisfactory‘ to ‗Good‘ categories to improve opportunities to attract investments.
6.5 DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND MITIGATION
1. Natural disasters may be triggered by adverse weather and climate conditions, whereas man-made 
disasters may be due to sabotage, human error or technological failure. Government therefore 
recognises the need to establish appropriate disaster preparedness and mitigation mechanism within 
the energy and petroleum sector.
2. The following hazards are a constant threat that must be taken into consideration in planning and 
management of the sector:
(a) Climate and weather hazards including floods and droughts.
(b) Geological hazards including earthquakes, faults, volcanic eruptions, subsidence, landslides, 
blowouts and mud flows.
(c) Environmental hazards including soil erosion, siltation and desertification.
(d) Industrial accidents, oil spills, human negligence, sabotage through terrorism and other deliberate 
acts and infrastructural systems failure.3. The challenges are mainly in setting up and making operational disaster prevention, preparedness, 
management and mitigation institutions. This can be addressed through proper disaster prevention, 
preparedness and management mechanisms and practices.
6.6 LAND AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS
1. Energy development projects have various impacts on communities where the projects are 
implemented. Key among these is economic and physical displacement. Physical displacement of 
people affected by the project is prevalent in projects such as hydro power plants requiring water 
reservoirs, petroleum and coal development, acquisition of way leaves during construction of 
transmission lines and pipelines. Others include the concern by local communities that they will not 
benefit from these projects.
6.7 CHALLENGES IN LAND, ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH AND SAFETY
1. Inadequate review and update of physical plans and land use.
2. Absence of a comprehensive and fair compensation mechanism.
3. Vandalism of energy infrastructure continues to cause adverse impact on security of supply.
4. High costs due to variation from the preferred land use required for development.
5. Potential negative impact on the social, cultural or recreational life of communities.
6. Inadequate operational capacity for disaster prevention, preparedness, management and mitigation.
7. Low compliance with health, safety and environmental laws and regulations.
8. Absence of a national Resettlement Action Plan Framework.
9. Inadequate health, safety, environmental and quality laws to regulate energy projects.
10. Low public awareness and sensitization in the obligatory role of each individual in their right to a 
clean and safe environment.
11. Inadequate human and technical capacity to handle EHS risks associated with emerging areas such 
as upstream petroleum, coal and nuclear.6.8 POLICIES AND STRATEGIES FOR LAND, ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH AND SAFETY

  7.0 – DEVOLUTION AND PROVISION OF ENERGY SERVICES
7.1 BACKGROUND
1. The Constitution has introduced significant changes in the governance structures in the country, 
especially in relation to administrative, resource allocation and service delivery functions. It has 
introduced two levels of government i.e. the National and County Governments and further provided 
for the distribution of functions and powers between the two levels, inter alia, under Articles 185(2), 
186(1) and 187(2).
2. Kenya has been divided into 47 counties as shown in Figure 7.1. The status and challenges of 
energy resources as well as infrastructure and services in the counties are very diverse.
Figure 7.1 – Kenya and its 47 Counties
3. As set out under Article 174 of the Constitution, the objects of devolution of government are to:
(a) Promote democratic and accountable exercise of power.
(b) Foster national unity by recognising diversity.(c) Give powers of self-governance to the people and enhance the participation of the people in the 
exercise of the powers of the State and in making decisions affecting them.
(d) Recognise the right of communities to manage their own affairs and to further their development.
(e) Protect and promote the interests and rights of minorities and marginalised communities.
(f) Promote social and economic development and the provision of proximate, easily accessible 
services throughout Kenya.
(g) Ensure equitable sharing of national and local resources throughout Kenya.
(h) Facilitate the decentralisation of State organs, their functions and services, from the capital of 
Kenya.
(i) Enhance checks and balances and the separation of powers.
4. Further, under Article 175, County Governments established under the Constitution shall reflect the 
following main governance principles:
(a) County Governments shall be based on democratic principles and the separation of powers.
(b) County Governments shall have reliable sources of revenue to enable them to govern and deliver 
services effectively.
(c) No more than two-thirds of the members of representative bodies in each county government 
shall be of the same gender.
5. It is a further requirement under Article 176 (2) that every County government decentralise its 
functions and the provision of its services to the extent that it is efficient and practicable to do so.
6. Under Article 202 (1), the Constitution further requires that Revenue raised nationally be shared 
equitably among the national and county governments. Under Article 202 (2): County governments 
may be given additional allocations from the national government‘s share of the revenue, either 
conditionally or unconditionally.
7. Article 191 provides for the resolution mechanisms and co-operation arrangements where there are 
conflicts between national and county laws in respect of matters falling within the concurrent 
jurisdiction of both levels of government. The proposed sharing of functions between the national 
and county governments is discussed in section 7.2.
8. Each County Government will have a Legislature and an Executive. It is noted under Article 6, that 
although the two levels of government are distinct and inter-dependent, they are required to conduct 
their mutual relations on the basis of consultation and co-operation.

(h) Contribution from consumers.
8.5. ENERGY PRICING AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC ISSUES
8.5.1 Energy Pricing
Electricity
1. Electricity pricing is based on the principles of Long Run Marginal Cost (LRMC) of supply. The enduser-tariff incorporates all prudent costs in the value chain and a fair return to the investors. The bulk 
tariffs are negotiated between producers and the off-taker, however, the Power Purchase Agreement 
is subject to approval by the Commission. The retail tariffs are regulated by the Commission and 
may be subject to review at least every three years.
2. Fuel costs and exchange rates gains/losses are pass-through costs in the current regime. These 
account for power cost variations in the event of fluctuation in the international crude oil prices as well 
as volatility for the Kenya shilling against foreign currencies, mainly the US dollar.
3. Other costs that affect electricity prices include steam charges, hydro water charges, charges 
imposed by the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), Kenya Forest Service (KFS) for lease of land for wind 
and geothermal project developments, and charges imposed by regional development authorities.8.5.2 Household Energy Consumption Patterns
1. There are two main models used to explain household energy allocation behaviour. These are the 
fuel stacking and fuel ladder models as shown in Figure 8.3.
2. The fuel stacking model shows that as people become richer, they may be expected to move from 
traditional biomass fuels to more advanced and less polluting fuels (e.g. from wood to charcoal, 
kerosene, and then to gas).
3. The fuel ladder model postulates that fuel switching is mainly observed when there is significant 
increase in income. The fuel stacking model is where a household use multiple fuels. In this model, 
households continue to use more than one fuel as income increases.
Figure 8.3 Fuel Stacking and Fuel Ladder Models
4. In a survey on consumption patterns in Kenya, it was revealed that in Kenya, consumers engage in 
Fuel stacking rather than Fuel switching (KIPPRA, 2009).
5. The challenge is to move consumers up the energy ladder. Biomass, which is at the bottom of the 
energy ladder, provides 60% of cooking energy needs in Kenya. 
6. Although price is a major influence in the choice taken, other factors that also influence the preferred 
type of energy include income, fuel quality, convenience, accessibility and availability. The prices of 
conventional energy resources, which are subject to structured commercial supply/demand markets, 
include the cost of production plus profit margins and an array of taxes. Traditional energy resources 
such as wood fuel are often priced in an informal, less structured market. Thus, prices may only 
reflect the cost of extraction (labour) and transportation. The cost of the raw material (e.g. tree 
replacement) is generally not considered.8.5.4 Policies and Strategies
