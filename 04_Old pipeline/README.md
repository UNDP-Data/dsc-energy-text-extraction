# PDF Data Processing Pipeline

## Overview

Jupyter Notebook files for the PDF data processing pipeline. The pipeline involves the following tasks:

1. **Downloading and Extracting PDF Data**: The `pipeline.ipynb` notebook downloads PDF files from URLs specified in a CSV document compilation, extracts text content from the PDFs, and saves the data in JSON format.

2. **Text Data Transformation**: The `txt_generating.ipynb` notebook processes the JSON data generated by the first step, removes unwanted symbols, and generates raw text files in a structured format.

## Repository Structure

- `pipeline.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for downloading PDFs and processing them.

- `txt_generating.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for transforming JSON data into text files.

- `Document Compilation - UNDP SEH - All.csv`: The CSV file containing metadata and links to PDF documents.

- `document_compilation_json/`: Directory to store JSON format metadata.

- `pdf_documents/`: Directory to store downloaded PDF files.

- `txt_files_raw/`: Directory to store the generated text files.

- `txt_files_cleaned_namually/`: Directory to store the manually cleaned text files.
