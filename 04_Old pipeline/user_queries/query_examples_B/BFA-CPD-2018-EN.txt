I'm interested in understanding Burkina Faso's national initiatives between 2018 and 2020 in the wake of a new political era and challenges like terrorism and social instability. I want to know how the country, as a member of the G5 Sahel, is focusing on justice system reform, national unity, and anti-corruption measures. Could you provide information on their alignment with organizations such as ECOWAS, the African Union, and the United Nations principles? I also want to learn about their strategies for gender equality, youth employment, and modern energy services as part of their NESDP. How is UNDP supporting these efforts to better support the country's SDGs, especially in the areas of institutional effectiveness and climate resilience society?
