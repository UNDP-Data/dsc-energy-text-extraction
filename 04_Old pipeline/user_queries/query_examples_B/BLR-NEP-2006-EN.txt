I'm interested in the Belarus National Energy Strategy from 2006 to 2010. What are the country's key objectives in both the supply and consumer side of energy? What are some international influence on the country's energy sector? Specifically, I'd like to know about their plans for geographical diversification of energy supplies and the development of renewable sources. Could you also provide information on their energy cooperation with the EU, and the role of various stakeholders including governmental bodies and NGOs? Lastly, what risks and assumptions have been identified in the implementation of their energy policy?
