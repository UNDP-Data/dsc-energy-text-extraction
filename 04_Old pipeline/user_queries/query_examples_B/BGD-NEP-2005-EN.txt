I'm interested in understanding Bangladesh's National Energy policies in 2005. Can you provide infomration on how the policy addresses sustainable economic growth and energy development? I want to know about their strategies for optimum development of indigenous energy sources and how they plan to tackle energy shortages. I'm also curious about the governmentâ€™s vision to provide reliable and affordable power to all by 2020, and how it relates to environmental sustainability and rural development. Additional details on their objectives like regional energy market development, public and private sector participation, policies and regulations would be helpful.
