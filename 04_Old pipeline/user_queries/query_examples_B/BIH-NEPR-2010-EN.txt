I'm interested in the energy landscape of Bosnia and Herzegovina around 2010. Could you summarize their energy mix, including data on natural gas, fossil fuels, hydro, and alternative energies like wind and solar? I'm interested into their dependence on imported energy and potential for domestic energy production, in that case, what are the key resources, and are there any significant future prospects for renewable energy? Lastly, what is the state of their modernization efforts, especially in hydroelectric power stations?
