I'm interested in Belize's National energy policies for 2011 to 2030. Could you provide insights into its main policy goals, vision, and objectives? I'm particularly interested to understand how Belize is planning to address security of energy supplies, environmental protection, and competitiveness. What are the key areas identified to attain these objectives, and how does the policy intend to achieve energy efficiency and reduce reliance on imported fuels? Information on cross-cutting issues, international and regional energy trade, and cooperation, as well as gender issues, would also be beneficial.
