I'm interested in understanding how Belarus is focusing on Improving Energy Efficiency in Residential Buildings from 2018 to 2033. Given the country's high dependence on energy imports from Russia, I'd like to know more about its initiatives to introduce new performance-based building design and construction standards. Specifically, how has the Government of Belarus committed to aligning these standards with the EU Energy Efficiency Performance? What are other global corporations? How have stakeholders and regulatory bodies contributed to the actual outcomes? How are these contributing to the reduction in energy consumption and GHG emissions in new residential buildings? Finally, some assessments on evaluations of energy savings and GHG reductions on this project would be helpful.
