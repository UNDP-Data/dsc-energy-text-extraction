I'm seeking information about Bangladesh's sustainability development challenges and UNDP initiatives for the period 2022 to 2026. Given that the country is facing issues like climate-induced disasters, economic vulnerabilities due to reliance on garment exports and remittances, and widening inequalities exacerbated by COVID-19, I want to know more about the country's strategies for tackling those issues, specifically, for poverty and inequality reduction, focusing on digital transformation. I'm also keen to understand UNDP's role in addressing these challenges, particularly in areas like climate change adaptation, disaster risk management, and social protection.
