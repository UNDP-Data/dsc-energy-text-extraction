I'm interested in Bolivia's energy data from 2014 to 2022. I am interested into how some energy-related metrics such as Total Energy Supply (TES) have evolved, with a focus on the growth percentages in non-renewable and renewable energy. What has been the trend in Primary energy trade, including imports and exports? How have energy self-sufficiency, energy intensity, and renewable capacity changed? I'd also like to understand the country's performance in SDG indicators such as access to electricity, clean cooking, renewable energy percentage as well and air quality. Could you provide insights into energy consumption by sector, including industry, transport, and households? Are there any recent policies, programs, or legislation for efficient co-generation?
