I'm interested in understanding Barbados's sustainability report, and the sustainable development initiatives for Small Island Developing States (SIDS) as outlined in their 2015 report. I want to know about their long-term commitments through 2029, focusing on sustainable energy for all, challenges due to unique vulnerabilities, and climate change impacts. I'm also keen on learning what actions have been agreed upon to mitigate their high dependency on imported fossil fuels and any initial financial support they've received. Furthermore, I'm curious about the specific targets set for Cape Verde and the Cook Islands in relation to renewable energy and energy efficiency.
