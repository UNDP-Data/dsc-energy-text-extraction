Can you provide me the roadmap for Belize towards energy efficiency, sustainability, and resilience over the next 30 years? I'm interested in understanding Belize's National Energy Policy Framework from 2011 to 2040. What strategies and goals does it outline to address energy efficiency issues? I'd like to know about their policy recommendations concerning GHG emissions, indigenous energy sources, and the diversity of the energy supply mix. Also, how does the framework aim to minimize the cost and dependence on foreign energy sources? Are there any effective rules and smart policy frameworks?
