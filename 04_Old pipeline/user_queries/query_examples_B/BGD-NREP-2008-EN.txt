I'm interested to dive into Bangladesh's National Renewable Energy Policy from 2015 to 2020. I wanted some background information on general energy status, particularly the shift in to renewables and its contributing factors. What strategies are in place for boosting the use of renewables? Could you provide a status update on their leading renewable sources, specifically solar, wind, and biomass, and discuss the challenges to scaling these up? I'm also interested in their objectives for involving both the public and private sectors in these renewable projects. What role does the Sustainable Energy Development Agency (SEDA) have in implementing these policies? Are there any notable achievements in renewable plants across the country? Lastly, is there any form of support from international organizations or local NGOs?
