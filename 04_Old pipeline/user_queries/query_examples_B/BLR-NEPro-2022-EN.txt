
I'm interested in some specific data on Belarus's energy landscape and trends from 2014 to 2022. Specifically, I'd like to know how some key energy-related metrics such as Total Energy Supply (TES) have evolved, with a focus on the growth percentages in non-renewable and renewable energy. What are the policy measures the country has taken to deal with energy self-sufficiency? Could you provide insights into energy consumption by sector, including industry, transport, and households?  Additionally, could you elaborate on Belarus's latest energy-related policies, programs, and legislation? How do these align with the SDGs?
