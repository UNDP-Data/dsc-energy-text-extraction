I'm interested in Bhutan's energy landscape data from 2014 to 2022. Specifically, I'd like to know how some key energy-related metrics such as Total Energy Supply (TES), Total Imports (TI), Total Exports (TE) have evolved, with a focus on the growth percentages in non-renewable and renewable energy. How has energy self-sufficiency changed? I'd also like to understand the country's performance in SDG indicators such as access to electricity, clean cooking, and renewable energy percentage, as well as air quality. Could you provide insights into energy consumption by sector, including industry, transport, and households? Lastly, are there any recent policies, programs, or legislation to support?
