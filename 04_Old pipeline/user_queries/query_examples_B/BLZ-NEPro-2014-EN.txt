I'm interested in Belize's energy data from 2014 to 2022. Specifically, I'd like to know how some energy-related metrics such as Total Energy Supply (TES) have evolved, with a focus on the percentage shift in non-renewable and renewable energy. What has been the trend in energy imports and exports? How has energy accessibility evolved? How has self-sufficiency changed? I'd also like to understand the country's performance in other SDG indicators such as CO2 emissions. Could you provide insights into energy consumption by sector? Lastly, what are different renewables capacity changes?
