I'm looking for insights into Benin's country program from 2019 to 2023. How is the country addressing its high poverty rates, and inequity in rural and women-headed households? I'd like details on their economic diversification strategies and plans, especially for the agricultural sector.  Could you also elaborate on their approaches to good governance and corruption reduction? Additionally, how is Benin addressing the impacts of climate change and natural disasters facing its high population growth? I'm also interested to know about UNDP's involvement as well as any other international support or initiatives aiding Benin in these areas.
