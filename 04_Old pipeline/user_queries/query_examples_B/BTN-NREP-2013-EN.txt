I'm interested in understanding Bhutan's Alternative Renewable Energy Policy covering the years 2013 to 2025. How does this policy fit into Bhutan's unique development philosophy of Gross National Happiness (GNH)? I'd like to know about the long-term and short-term objectives of the policy and the institutional arrangements. Can you provide insights into the implementation mechanisms, key projects, and investment models? Additionally, what are the specific energy targets, such as achieving targets of a mix of renewable technologies like Solar, Wind, and Biomass? I'm also interested in understanding any Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) and other regulatory provisions. Finally, what methods are set for monitoring and evaluations? and how is the policy's success or challenges being interpreted?
