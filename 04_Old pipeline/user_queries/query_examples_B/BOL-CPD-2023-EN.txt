I'm looking for some information on Bolivia's country programme from 2023 to 2027. I'm interested in understanding how the program aligns with the nations' other development plans such as Patriotic Agenda 2025 and the Economic and Social Development Plan? How is the country tackling its economic reliance on fossil fuels and minerals? Could you also provide insights into the role of the UNDP as a strategic partner, particularly in the areas of public service delivery, multi-stakeholder dialogue, and sustainable finance? I'm additionally curious about how gender equality and women's rights are being incorporated into the programme, especially in the context of monitoring and evaluation.
