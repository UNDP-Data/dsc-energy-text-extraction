I'm interested in learning about Benin's National Energy Policy for the years 2011 to 2020. Could you provide insights into any significant changes on the energy-related metrics such as Total Energy Supply, and Energy Imports, Energy Impact by different sectors, etc.? I'm particularly keen on understanding their Energy flow, the percentage of different energy sources with a specific focus on renewables development. Additionally, details about geographical coverage, data quality, and methodological approaches would also be valuable.
