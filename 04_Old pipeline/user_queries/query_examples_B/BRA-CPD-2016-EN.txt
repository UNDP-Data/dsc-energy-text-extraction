I'm interested in understanding Brazil's Country programmes and sustainability-related social and environmental initiatives from 2017 to 2021. Given the recent improvement in poverty and inequality reduction, what are some further initiatives focusing on vulnerable groups such as the Northeast rural poor, indigenous, agro-extractivist, and African descent? What are some challenges on the environment and climate change? I'm also keen to know about Brazil's strategies for sustainable management of natural resources and their steps towards gender equality and women's empowerment. How has the UNDP partnered with Brazil in these efforts, especially in terms of public policy formulation and democratic dialogue?
