I'm interested in understanding Burundi's developmental strides and challenges from 2019 to 2023. Specifically, I want to know how the country is addressing its high poverty levelsï¼Œ and gender inequity, and what measures are being taken for economic growth and climate change.  Additionally, I'd like insights into UNDP's role in areas like financial inclusion for vulnerable groups, climate resilience, and judicial reforms. Can you provide information on Burundi's strategies to improve agricultural productivity and access to electricity, and how the National Development Plan align with the Sustainable Development Goals?
