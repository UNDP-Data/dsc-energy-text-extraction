I'm looking for information on the UNDP's multi-country program in Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean from 2022 to 2026. Specifically, I'd like insights into how the program addresses the region's vulnerability to climate change, high dependence on tourism, and societal inequalities. I'm also interested in their strategies for economic diversification, notably the "blue economy for green islands" approach, and collaborations for gender-responsive governance. Additionally, how does the program aim to deal with COVID-19 recovery as an overarching priority?
