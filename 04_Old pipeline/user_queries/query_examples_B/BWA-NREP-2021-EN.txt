I'm interested in understanding what is the level of readiness for Botswana's renewable energy from 2021 to 2040. Can you provide some general status of the country's renewables level? I want to understand the readiness assessment methodologies employed and how they contribute to identifying actions needed to overcome barriers to renewable energy deployment. How is Botswana planning for its future energy mix with a focus on renewable energy potential and use? What enabling frameworks for renewable energy deployment are mentioned in terms of policy and regulatory frameworks and institutional frameworks? I'm also interested in any key challenges and recommendations for risk mitigation in renewable energy procurement and strategies for rural electrification and decentralized generation.
