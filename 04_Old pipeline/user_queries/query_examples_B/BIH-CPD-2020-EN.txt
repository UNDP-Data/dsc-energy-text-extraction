I'm looking for insights into Bosnia and Herzegovina's UNDP Country Programme Document from 2021 to 2025. Given the country's challenges like EU accession constraints, political deadlocks, and a shrinking, aging population, how is the UNDP program aiming to foster sustainable and inclusive growth?  I'm interested in their initiatives around public sector governance, flood recovery, and climate change adaptation and mitigation. Additionally, I'd like to know how the program plans to address youth unemployment and out-migration as well as its efforts towards achieving Agenda 2030.
