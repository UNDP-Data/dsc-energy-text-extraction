I'm interested in understanding Burundi's energy sector between the years 2010 and 2020. Specifically, I want to learn about the challenges faced due to low electrification rates, political conflict, and deforestation. Can you provide insights into the government's strategic targets and action plans for energy development? This includes their approach to both conventional and renewable energy sources like hydropower, solar, and wind energy. Additionally, what are the key recommendations in the realm of governance and private sector involvement, also what are some supports from other organizations such as the East African Community?
