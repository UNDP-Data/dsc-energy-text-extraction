I'm interested in learning more about Bhutan's Country Programme Document for 2019-2023. Specifically, I want to know how the program aims to address poverty and its relationship with land and agriculture, given the country's main economy relies on the agriculture sector. What are the country's priorities concerning the SDGs, especially Goals 1, 13, and 15? How is Bhutan planning to involve women, youth, and people with disabilities in its developmental strategies? Lastly, what role do partnerships with UNDP and other United Nations organizations play in Bhutan's initiatives?
