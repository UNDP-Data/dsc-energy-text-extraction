I'm interested in learning how Bahrain going to improve national energy efficiency and under what action plan from 2017 to 2025? Given the fact that Bahrain has set a vision for a sustainable energy transition, what are the key components of this vision, particularly concerning reducing and managing electricity demand, renewable energy initiatives, and energy efficiency standards? I'm also keen to learn about the role of the Sustainable Energy Unit established in 2014. Could you elaborate on how these initiatives align with Bahrain's commitments under the Paris Agreement and the UN SDGs? What are some Energy Efficiency Initiatives covering Residential and Commercial, Government, Industry, Electricity, and Transport?
