I'm interested in learning about Barbados' National Energy Policy for the years spanning 2015 to 2030. Can you provide details on the Implementation Plan developed by the Ministry of Energy and Water Resources? I'm particularly keen to understand how Barbados aims to be 100% Fossil Fuel Free (FFF) by 2030. What are the policy measures, toolkit, activities, and risks involved? Also, how does this align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals? I'd also like insights into how key stakeholders, including NGOs and government agencies, are involved in this transition, as well as its implications for economic conditions, environmental health, and tourism.
