I'm interested in the National Energy Policy of Botswana spanning from 2020 to 2040. Specifically, I'd like to understand how the policy aims to integrate new and renewable energy sources into the country's energy mix to achieve self-sufficiency and increased security of supply. I'm also curious about the policy's focus on economic diversification and its implication for Botswana's Vision 2036. How does the NEP plan to tackle power supply and demand mismatches that have historically impacted Botswana's economic development? Additionally, I'd like to know more about regional synergies with SADC countries and how this strategy might affect Botswana's energy sovereignty.
