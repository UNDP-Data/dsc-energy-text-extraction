I'm interested in understanding the Barbados National Energy Policy (BNEP) for 2019-2030. Specifically, I want to learn about Barbados' energy security strategies in the context of its high reliance on imported energy and fluctuating global prices. How does the country plan to achieve energy affordability through diversity and collaboration? What are the initiatives to increase the use of renewable energy technologies like solar, wind, ocean, and biomass to reduce carbon emissions and fight climate change? Moreover, are there plans to explore offshore and onshore resources for energy production?
