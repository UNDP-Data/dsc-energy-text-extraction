I'm interested in datailed data on Burkina Faso's energy profile for the period 2014 to 2022. I would like to understand the changes in Total Energy Supply (TES) over the years, with a focus on the share of renewable energy. I'm particularly keen on knowing about the growth rates in renewable and non-renewable energy supplies. Additionally, could you provide details on Burkina Faso's energy trade dynamics, such as imports and exports? Lastly, what does this information reveal about the country's energy self-sufficiency and how it aligns with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?
