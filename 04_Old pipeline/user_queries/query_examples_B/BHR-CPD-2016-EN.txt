I'm interested in information about Bahrain's sustainable development strategies and economic diversification from 2017 to 2020ï¼Ÿ The country has shown economic growth largely due to its strong oil sector, but I'm keen to understand its efforts towards economic diversification, particularly in tourism and e-commerce. How is the Bahrain government working with international organizations like UNDP, the World Bank, and UNEP in areas like sustainable energy and government efficiency? I'm also curious about their initiatives aimed at less privileged citizens and how these align with the country's Vision 2030 and SDGs?
