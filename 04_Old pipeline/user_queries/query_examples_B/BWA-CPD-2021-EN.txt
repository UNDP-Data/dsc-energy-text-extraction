I'm interested in learning about Botswana's Country Programme Document from 2022 to 2026. 
How is the country going to tackle economic growth, public expenditure, and attempts to diversify the economy, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic? How is Botswana tackling its high levels of poverty and inequality, and what steps are being taken in the realm of good governance? Could you also delve into gender equality, youth unemployment, and civic participation? Furthermore, the report highlights a focus on environmental governance and natural resource management. What collaborations and partnerships from international organizations like UNDP have helped to address these areas?
