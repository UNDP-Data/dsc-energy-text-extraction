I'm interested in the Renewables Readiness by IRENA for Belarus covering 2021 to 2050. I would like to know about the key aspects of Belarus's current energy sector and the proposed measures to foster the development of renewables. Can you provide an overall country overview with a focus on energy sector including the resources, electricity and heat balance, power infrastructure, and the institutional framework? What renewable energy policies and regulations are highlighted? Additionally, any recommendations for accelerating progress? How does this align with SDG Goal 7? Could you also provide information on how renewables contribute to the country's economic growth, increased energy security, and reduction of GHG emissions?
