I'm interested in Brazil's energy landscape data from 2014 to 2022. I'd like to know how key energy-related metrics such as Total Energy Supply (TES), Energy Imports, and Exports have evolved, with a focus on the shift percentages in the non-renewable and renewable energy mix. How has energy self-sufficiency changed? I'd also like to understand the country's performance in SDG indicators such as access to electricity and clean cooking, renewable energy percentage, and air quality indicators. Could you provide insights into energy consumption by sector, including industry, transport, and households? Also, what are some financial flows to renewables?  Lastly, are there any recent policies, programs, or legislation for efficient co-generation?
