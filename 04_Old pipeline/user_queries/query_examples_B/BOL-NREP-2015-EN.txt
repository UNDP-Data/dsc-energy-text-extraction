I'm interested to learn some policy briefs on Bolivia's National Renewable Energy Policy in 2015 and looks ahead to 2025. I want to know how the policy ties in with Bolivia's 2009 Constitution that emphasizes developing alternative energy in an environmental and sustainable development manner. I'm looking for information about the policy's objectives as set forth in the Patriotic Agenda for the year 2025 and list some regulations or frameworks in order to achieve that.
