I'd like to know more about Belize's Country Development Program for the years 2022 to 2026. Given the challenges like structural inequalities, citizen insecurity, and economic vulnerabilities tied to natural resource-based industries, how is Belize planning to address these issues? What are their approaches towards climate vulnerability, social protection, and social inclusion? What is UNDP's role and what are its program priorities in aiding Belize towards sustainability? I'm also interested in which SDGs are being focused on and how the program aims to include marginalized and underrepresented communities. Additionally, are there strategies to address challenges like data fragmentation in achieving SDGs?
