Can you provide insights into Bhutan's Integrated Energy Management Master Plan spanning from 2015 to 2020? I'm keen to understand their energy sector overview as well as energy scenarios projected for the country during this period. Specifics on energy supply options for Bhutan and demand-side efficiency enhancements for energy demand management would be highly valuable. I'm also interested in learning about overarching issues that link energy, development, and the environment. Any recommendations proposed in the report would be an added bonus.
