I'm interested in learning the energy landscape in Benin for the years 2014 to 2020. Can you provide insights on the country's Total Energy Supply trends, including the growth in renewable and non-renewable sources? I'd also like to understand Benin's energy self-sufficiency levels and their progress on SDGs related to energy, such as access to electricity and clean cooking. Additionally, what are other environmental factors such as the air quality indicators in the country?
