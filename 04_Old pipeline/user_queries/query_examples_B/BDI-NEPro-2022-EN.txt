I'm looking for data on Burundi's energy landscape from 2014 to 2022. Specifically, I want to understand the changes in the country's Total Energy Supply, as well as other metrics like energy intensity and shifts between renewable and non-renewable energy sources. Could you also provide insights in their energy self-sufficiency, primary energy trade, and their alignment with UN SDGs? Also, what has been the trend in renewable energy consumption and capacity in recent years, especially in the context of solar, wind, and hydro energy?
