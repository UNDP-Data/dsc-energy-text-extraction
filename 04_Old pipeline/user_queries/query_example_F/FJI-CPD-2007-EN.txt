I'm interested in learning about Fiji's development programme for 2008-2012, which is part of the UNDP's multi-country efforts in the Pacific. How does this align with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as well as with Fiji's own national priorities? Could you elaborate on strategies focused on crisis prevention, good governance, and human rights? I'm particularly keen on initiatives aimed at the sustainable management of environment and natural resources. How does the program specifically address the needs of vulnerable groups such as the rural poor, women, and youth? What strategies are in place for natural disaster preparedness and recovery? Lastly, could you provide information on the support received from UNDP in this context?
