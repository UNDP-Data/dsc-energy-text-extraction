I'm looking to a deep review of Fiji's National Energy Policy in 2013. Can you provide status of implementation of the 2006 Energy Policy and its Strategic Action Plan. I also wanted to learn about how Fiji is mainstreaming these energy policies into national planning. Could you provide insights into various sectors discussed in the report like energy planning, grid-based power supply, rural electrification, renewable energy, transport, petroleum, bio-fuels, and energy efficiency? I'm also curious to know what recommendations are made for mainstreaming energy policies and if any international cooperation like German Technical Cooperation (GIZ) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) were involved in supporting the review process.
