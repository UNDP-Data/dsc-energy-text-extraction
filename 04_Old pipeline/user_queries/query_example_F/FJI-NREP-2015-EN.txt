I'm interested in information about Fiji's Renewable Energy Plans spanning from 2015 to 2035. What are Fijiâ€™s key energy challenges, final energy consumption, and energy demand outlook?  I'm particularly interested in understanding the Renewables Readiness Assessment; how prepared is Fiji for implementing renewable energy solutions?  Could you provide insights into Fiji's specific Renewable Energy Targets and their Power Sector Development Plan? Additionally, what are the identified enablers for investments in renewable energy, and how does the report address financing and investment options? Are there any recommendations for the deployment of renewable energy in Fiji?
