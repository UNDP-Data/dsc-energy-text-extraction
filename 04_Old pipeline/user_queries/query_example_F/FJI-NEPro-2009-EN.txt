I'm interested in information about Fiji's energy policy and security initiatives from 2009 to 2012. Specifically, I want to understand the outcomes of their Framework for Action on Energy Security in the Pacific (FAESP) endorsed at the Pacific Islands Forum in Port Vila, Vanuatu. Could you provide details on the key energy security outcomes like access to energy, affordability, efficiency, and environmental quality? Also, what action themes were emphasized, such as leadership and governance, capacity development, and energy production? Are there specific sections related to renewable energy, electric power, and energy efficiency in transportation?
