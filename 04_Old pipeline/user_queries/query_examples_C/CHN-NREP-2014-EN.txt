I am interested to delve into China's renewable energy prospects from 2015 to 2030. I'm particularly interested in understanding the current policy framework, including the Airborne Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan and carbon policy? How does China plan to change its energy mix, especially to increase the share of modern renewables by 2030? What are the investment requirements and economic benefits, including health and carbon reduction? Lastly, I'm looking for insights into barriers and opportunities, specifically in the power and end-use sectors. I'd also like insights into recent trends in renewable energy and the current energy situation in the country. What are the barriers and opportunities discussed
