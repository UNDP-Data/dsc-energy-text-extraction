I'm looking for data on the Republic of the Congo's (COG)'s energy landscape from 2014 to 2022. Specifically, I want to understand the changes in the country's Total Energy Supply, as well as other metrics like energy intensity and shifts between renewable and non-renewable energy sources. Could you also provide insights into Congo's energy self-sufficiency levels and their alignment with SDG objectives? What is the energy capacity? Information related to the country's energy trade dynamics, such as imports and exports, would be helpful too. Key metrics on energy consumption by sectors would also be interesting.
