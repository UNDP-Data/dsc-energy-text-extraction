I'm looking for information on Cameroon's National Development Strategy from 2022 to 2026. How these plans aim to transform the country into a high-income industrialized nation while also focusing on reducing poverty, promoting economic growth, and consolidating democracy. How do these strategies plan to tackle the issue of slow economic transformation and non-inclusive growth? Also some environmental challenges of unsustainable resource exploitation, climate, and disaster preparedness? I'm also keen to understand how the UNDP programmatic offer aligns with these frameworks, particularly in the areas of structural transformation, inclusive governance, peacebuilding, climate change, and socioeconomic development? What are some strategic focus and SDG outcomes?
