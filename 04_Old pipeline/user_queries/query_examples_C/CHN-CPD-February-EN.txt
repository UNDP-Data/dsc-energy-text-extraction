Could you delve into China's national development as it shift from rapid economic growth to high-quality development as articulated in the 14th Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development covering 2021 to 2025? How is China addressing unbalanced and inadequate development, rural poverty eradication, and peopleâ€™s increasing aspirations for a better quality of life? I'm interested in their policies on sustainable development, gender equality, climate change, and carbon neutrality. Additionally, how is UNDP collaborating with Chinese agencies to tackle challenges in environmental sustainability, technological transformation, energy transitions, ageing society, and inequality? What are the targeted interventions for vulnerable groups and green finance initiatives?
