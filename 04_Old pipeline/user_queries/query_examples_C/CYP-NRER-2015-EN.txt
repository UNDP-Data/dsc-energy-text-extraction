I'm looking for information on Cyprus' Renewable Energy Roadmap covering the span from 2015 to 2030. Specifically, I want insights into Cyprus' current energy use and demand forecasts, as developed in collaboration with other organizations including univerities? Are there some models can use to indicate about the optimal deployment of renewable energy under different scenarios? Furthermore, I'm interested in the six main scenarios in consultation with the Ministry of Energy, Commerce, Industry and Tourism. How do these scenarios illuminate policy decisions affecting Cyprus' electricity system, and what role does natural gas play in these scenarios? I'm also curious about the other analysis conducted and their implications for Cyprusâ€™ economic and energy system development.
