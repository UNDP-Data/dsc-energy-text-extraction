I'm interested in information about the EU-China Roadmap on energy cooperation covering the years 2016 to 2020. Specifically, I'd like to know how the two entities are working together to address climate change, environmental degradation, and energy security. I'm particularly interested in their strategies for renewable energy sourcing, power grid sector development, and energy crisis management. Additional insights into how they are planning to manage energy demand and efficiency would also be valuable. Lastly, what are some cross-cutting issues such as energy regulation and international cooperation that the EU and China are focusing on?
