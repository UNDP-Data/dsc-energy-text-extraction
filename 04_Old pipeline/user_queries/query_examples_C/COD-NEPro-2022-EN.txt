I'm interested in Democratic Republic of the Congo's energy data from 2014 to 2022. Specifically, I'd like to know how some key energy-related metrics such as Total Energy Supply (TES), Non-renewable (TJ), Renewable (TJ) have evolved? What has been the trend in Primary energy trade, including imports and exports? How has energy self-sufficiency, Energy Capacity changed? I'd also like to understand the country's performance in SDG indicators such as access to electricity, clean cooking, emissions, and renewable energy percentage. Could you provide insights into energy consumption by sector, including industry, transport, and households? Lastly, are there any other key data information?
