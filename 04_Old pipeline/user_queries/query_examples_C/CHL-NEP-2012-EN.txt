Can you provide some information about Chile's National Energy Strategy for 2012-2030? I want to know how the strategy aims to sustain Chile's economic growth through energy policies? I'm  interested in understanding their plans for energy efficiency across different sectors like residential, commercial, mining, transport, and industrial. Additionally, how are they approaching non-conventional renewable energy (NCRE)? What challenges and opportunities are identified, and what are the key legal, regulatory, and administrative measures planned for implementation?Lastly, is there any mechanism like an Interministerial Commission for cross-sector coordination?
