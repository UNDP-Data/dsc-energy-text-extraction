I'm interested in Cameroon's energy data from 2014 to 2022. I'd like to know how some key energy-related metrics such as Total Energy Supply (TES) has evolved, percentage of non-renewable and renewable energys? What has been the trend in Primary energy trade, including imports and exports? How has energy self-sufficiency changed? I'd also like to understand the country's performance in SDG indicators. Could you provide insights into energy consumption by sector, including industry, transport, and households? Lastly, are there any key data information?
