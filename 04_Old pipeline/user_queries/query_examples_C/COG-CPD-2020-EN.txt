I'm interested in the Republic of the Congo's (COG) development from 2020 to 2024, especially in the wake of its first peaceful transfer of power in 2018. How has the country progressed in terms of GDP growth and socioeconomic indicators? What challenges remain, such as high poverty rates and gender inequality? I'd also like to know about the UNDP's role in the country's development, particularly its efforts to integrate the Sustainable Development Goals into Congo's National Development Plan. Additional focus areas include youth unemployment, economic diversification, and the role of the agricultural and mining sectors. Any insights into partnerships with UN agencies and other international bodies would be helpful.
