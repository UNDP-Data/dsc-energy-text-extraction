I'm looking for information about the Central African Republic's development for the years 2023 to 2027. Could you start with a general country background introduction? I'm particularly interested in understanding the areas that need to be prioritized most in terms of sustainability. What are the key SDG issues facing the country? I'd also like to know about UNDP's support and monitoring efforts. Specifically, can you elaborate on UNDP's strategic priorities in relation to their four program outcomes: structural transformation and citizen participation, recovery, stabilization and peacebuilding, and environment, energy and climate change? Finally, could you provide details on how the UNDP plans to address human rights challenges and their targeted focus areas like support for young people at risk, internally displaced persons, and victims of human rights violations?
