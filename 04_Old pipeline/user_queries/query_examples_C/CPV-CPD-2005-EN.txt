I'm seeking comprehensive insights into Cabo Verde's UNDP country programme covering 2006-2010. I'd like to start with some background on Cabo Verde's main challenges during this period, particularly its transition from the Least Developed Countries (LDC) group. How has the UNDP contributed to promoting good governance, strengthening institutional capacities, and effectively managing international aid? Moreover, how do these initiatives align with the UN SDGs, especially in areas like governance, equity, and global partnerships? Could you also shed light on any outcome indicators used for success measurement, such as the number of agreements negotiated, aid implementation rates, or resources mobilized?
