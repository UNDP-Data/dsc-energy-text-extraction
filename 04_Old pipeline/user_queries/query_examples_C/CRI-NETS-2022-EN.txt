I'm looking for insights into Costa Rica's transition to sustainable energy and decarbonization from 2018 to 2050. Could you elaborate on how the national government and local municipalities are working together to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, particularly through the National Decarbonisation Plan and the net zero carbon scenario? I'm especially interested in urban energy contexts and the role of cities, as 75% of the population resides in urban areas. What renewable energy options are considered, and how are they planning to manage energy demand? What are the implications for energy costs and savings, and how are these tied to health benefits? Additionally, could you discuss any specific challenges and proposed actions at the municipal level, such as energy efficiency improvements, grid infrastructure upgrades, and alternative mobility options?
