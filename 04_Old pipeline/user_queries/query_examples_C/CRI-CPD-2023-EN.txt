I'm looking for information on the UNDP's Country Programme for Costa Rica covering the period from 2023 to 2027. I'm particularly interested in their strategies for reducing socioeconomic inequalities, enhancing resilience, and promoting sustainable development. Could you also provide insights into how the program plans to tackle increasing income inequality, labor informality, and the impact on vulnerable groups like women and indigenous peoples? I would like to know about any participatory processes used in forming this program, and any achievements or strengths highlighted by their recent evaluations. Lastly, is there any focus on decentralization and efficient state institutions in line with Costa Ricaâ€™s national priorities?
