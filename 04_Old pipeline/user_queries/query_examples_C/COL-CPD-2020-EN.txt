I'm interested in Colombia's national development strategies from 2021 to 2024, focusing on stabilizing conflict-affected areas and integrating Venezuelan migrants. How are Sustainable Development Goals like gender equality and environmental conservation being prioritized? Additionally, I'd like to know about UNDP's role during the COVID-19 crisis in aiding Colombia's data management and socioeconomic frameworks, as well as its involvement in fostering both rural and urban inclusive development. The query seeks to highlight key collaborative efforts between Colombia and UNDP in addressing national challenges and achieving SDG targets?
