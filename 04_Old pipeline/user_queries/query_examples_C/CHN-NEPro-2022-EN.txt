I'm interested in some detailed data on China's energy landscape from 2014 to 2022. Could you highlight data on Total Energy Supply (TES) and its division between renewable and non-renewable energy sources? Specifically, how has the renewable share (%) and growth in TES changed over the years? What are the trends in primary energy trade, particularly imports and exports, and how has this impacted energy self-sufficiency? Also, could you provide data on capacity changes in both renewable and non-renewable sectors, with special attention to solar, wind, and bioenergy? Lastly, I'd like insights into sustainability indicators like PM2.5 levels and air quality? Any other key data?
