I'm interested in Cuba 's energy data from 2014 to 2022. Specifically, I'd like to know how some key energy-related metrics such as Total Energy Supply (TES), and the shifts in the growth percentages in non-renewable vs. renewable energy. What has been the trend in Primary energy trade, including imports and exports? How has energy self-sufficiency changed? I'd also like to understand the country's performance in SDG indicators such as access to electricity, clean cooking, and renewable energy percentage. Could you provide insights into energy consumption by sector, including industry, transport, and households? Lastly, are there any key metrics and data?
