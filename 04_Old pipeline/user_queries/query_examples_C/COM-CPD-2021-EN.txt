I'm interested in information about Comoros' national development strategy for the period 2022 to 2026. The country has shown economic growth but still grapples with issues such as multidimensional poverty and vulnerability to climate change. I'd like to know how their 2019 development strategy addresses these challenges, and what are the priority SDGs? I'm looking for their initiatives in tourism, the blue economy, and modernized agriculture. Additionally, how is UNDP involved in supporting Comoros, particularly in areas like biodiversity conservation, disaster preparedness, and women's empowerment? What are other policies and partnerships with international organizations to support SDGs achievements?
