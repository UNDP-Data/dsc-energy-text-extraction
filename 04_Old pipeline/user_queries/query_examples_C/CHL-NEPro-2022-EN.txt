I'm interested in Chile's energy data from 2014 to 2022. Specifically, I'd like to know how some key energy-related metrics such as Total Energy Supply (TES) have evolved, with a focus on the growth percentages in non-renewable and renewable energy. What has been the trend in Primary energy trade, including imports and exports? How has energy self-sufficiency changed? I'd also like to understand the country's performance in SDG indicators such as emissions, and renewable energy percentage. Could you provide insights into their renewable energy potential in terms of solar, wind, and other Chile's renewable sources?
