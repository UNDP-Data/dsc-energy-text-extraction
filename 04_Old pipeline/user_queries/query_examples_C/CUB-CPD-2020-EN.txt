I'm interested in understanding Cuba's development strategies for the period 2020 to 2024 as in their country development program. Cuba appears to have a strong focus on sustainable development, evidenced by their high Human Development score. Can you provied information how they intend to close equity gaps and address territorial differences and population aging? What steps are they taking to maintain their progress in education, health, and life expectancy? I'm also curious about any specific initiatives for sustainable natural resource management and climate change adaptation. How does the U.S. economic blockade impact Cuba's SDG objectives? Lastly, could you provide details on partnerships between the UNDP and other UN bodies? I'm particularly interested in SDG-related initiatives targeting youth employment and technical training.
