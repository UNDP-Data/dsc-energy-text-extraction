I'm looking for information about the Democratic Republic of the Congo's National Development Plan from 2020 to 2024. Despite being classified as a middle-income country, the Congo faces economic fragility and high poverty rates, especially in rural areas and among people with disabilities and indigenous peoples. I'm interested in understanding their strategies to address these challenges, focusing on governance, peacebuilding, security, economic diversification, and poverty reduction. Additionally, what initiatives are in place to promote gender equality and women's empowerment? How will the country address environmental issues toward more sustainable agriculture? I would also like to know how UNDP is involved in enhancing governance and resilience in the country.
