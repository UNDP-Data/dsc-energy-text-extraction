I'm interested in finding information about Djibouti's National Renewable Energy Program (NREP) from 2015 to 2035. I am interested to know the nation's energy context and potential for renewable energy deployment, especially in understanding Djibouti's energy policies and regulatory framework as well as the financing and investment options available. I'd like insights into the regional context of Djibouti's energy supply and demand and how they tie into electricity generation, transmission, and distribution. What are the key energy stakeholders and institutional arrangements? I'm also interested in their renewable energy resources: potential and usage. Could you elaborate on emerging issues affecting renewable energy deployment like grid-connected and off-grid options? Finally, what recommended actions does the report propose for scaling up renewable energy?
