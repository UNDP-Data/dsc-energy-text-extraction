I'm interested in understanding Djibouti's development efforts from 2018 to 2022, particularly in the context of their United Nations Development Assistance Framework and accelerated growth strategy. I'd like to know how the country aims to tackle its low Human Development Index rating, high refugee density, and vulnerability to climate change. Specifically, I'm curious about their strategic priorities, such as economic growth, human capital development, regional sustainable development, and good governance. What are their commitments toward reducing poverty, promoting health, and ensuring access to basic services like energy and clean water? Additionally, I'm interested in their efforts in human rights compliance, including gender equality and migration and displacement issues. How is UNDP assisting Djibouti in these areas, especially in data collection and policy-making?
