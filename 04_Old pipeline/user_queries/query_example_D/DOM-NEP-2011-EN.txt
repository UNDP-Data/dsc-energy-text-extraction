I'm interested in understanding the Dominican Republic's National Energy Action Plan outlined in 2011. Specifically, I want to know how the country is tackling its dependence on imported fossil fuels and the macroeconomic implications of fuel costs. Are there plans to diversify energy sources to mitigate the volatility of fossil fuel prices? What initiatives exist for energy efficiency and conservation? I'm also curious about the administrative and institutional requirements to implement these plans, as well as any potential funding sources.
