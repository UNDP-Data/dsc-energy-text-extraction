I'm interested in understanding the United Nations Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) for the Dominican Republic from 2023 to 2027. I am interested in knowing the country's background, with a focus on several areas, including social security, public administration, and governance. I'd like to know more about how the Dominican Republic has approached inequality, as evidenced by the Gini Index, and its alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Additionally, what initiatives or programs have been led or supported by UN, particularly in areas like social security, MSME support, and sustainable production? Finally, I'm curious about the country's vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters and how that affects its development agenda.
