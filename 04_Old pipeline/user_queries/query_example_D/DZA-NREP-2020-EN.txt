I'm interested in Algeria's efforts in renewable energy focusing on the timeframe from 2015 to 2030. I wanted to understand their plan to add more renewables such as solar energy capacity by 2030 and how AREP is supporting this agenda. What role do Independent Power Producers (IPPs) play in this, and how is the technical, legal, and institutional framework being developed for them? I'm also curious about the capacity building on legal template agreements like Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) and Concession Agreements. Lastly, could you provide insights on how this aligns with Algeriaâ€™s broader strategies such as the National Renewable Energy Development Strategy 2015-2030 and their commitment to sustainable development?
