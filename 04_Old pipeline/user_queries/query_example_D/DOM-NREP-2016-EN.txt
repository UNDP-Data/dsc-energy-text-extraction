I'm interested in the Dominican Republic's National Renewable Energy Plan from 2016 to 2030. The country faces challenges like fuel import dependence and exposure to oil price volatility. Are there strategies for scaling up renewable energy resources to meet the energy demand and realize socio-economic benefits? How does the plan aim to use 25% more renewable power by 2025 and what are the expected economic, health, and energy security outcomes? Additionally, what are the roles and challenges identified for different sectors like power, industry, and transport in achieving these goals? Finally, what are the investment needs, costs, and benefits outlined in the report, and how does it align with international commitments like the Paris agreement?
