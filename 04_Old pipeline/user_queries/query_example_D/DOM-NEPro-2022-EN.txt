I'm looking for data and information on Dominican Republic's energy landscape from 2014 to 2022. Specifically, I want to understand the changes in the country's Total Energy Supply, as well as other metrics like energy intensity and shifts between renewable and non-renewable energy sources. Could you also provide insights into Argentina's energy self-sufficiency levels and their alignment with SDG objectives? Can you use data and related metric to showcase Information related to the country's energy trade dynamics, such as imports and exports?
