I'm looking to explore how Armenia addressed energy efficiency in 2015. Specifically, I'd like to know about the government's key pillars for improving energy efficiency and how they aim to enhance economic growth while improving energy security. Can you tell me the sectors such as building, industrial, transport? Can you also elaborate on Armenia's targets for energy savings and how they have evolved since the first energy efficiency program? Additionally, what role do international organizations like UNDP play in this context?
