Can you tell me Albania's development program from 2022 to 2026, with SDGs topics includes rule of law, institutional capacity gaps, social includsion, and natural resource degradation. Can you inlcude how UNDP's support in tackling these challenges? Can you also tell me how the country is managing the socioeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and natural disasters like the 2019 earthquake? Could you provide details on their strategies related to economic transformation, poverty eradication, gender equality, and justice? I'm particularly interested in how Albania plans to align these efforts with its goal for European Union accession and what kinds of partnerships UNDP is establishing to support these initiatives.
