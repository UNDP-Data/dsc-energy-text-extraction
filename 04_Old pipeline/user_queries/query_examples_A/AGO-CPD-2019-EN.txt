I'm looking for information about Angola's development program from 2020 to 2022. I'm interested in their efforts to tackle poverty, promote economic growth, human rights, governance, and sustainable development goals. Also, any details about their initiatives for renewable energy, gender equality, youth participation, and UNDP support would be helpful.
