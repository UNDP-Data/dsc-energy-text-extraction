I'm looking for Afghanistan's energy sector information from 2014 to 2022. Specifically in the country's Total Energy Supply growth over the years and how the renewable energy share has changed? Levels of renewable energy utilization like solar, hydro/marine, and wind? Additionally, I'd like to know data on energy self-sufficiency and trade dynamics, such as imports and exports? Could you provide data or observations on how the energy sector aligns with Afghanistan's Sustainable Development Goals, particularly in terms of access to electricity access, clean cooking?
