I'm interested in understanding Azerbaijan's renewable energy landscape from 2016 to 2025. The country is traditionally known for its oil and natural gas reserves, but there seems to be a shift towards renewable energy. What are the main drivers behind this shift and who is leading these initiatives? Also, how do low oil prices and the Covid-19 pandemic affect renewable energy development? Could you provide information on the government's subsidy policies in this sector, and the challenges faced in terms of access to capital and public awareness?
