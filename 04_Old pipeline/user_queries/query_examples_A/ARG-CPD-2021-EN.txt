Can you provide information on Argentina's development programme from 2021 to 2025? I want to know how the UNDP is supporting Argentina to tackle socio-economic and territorial inequalities, as well as challenges heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic. I'm also interested to know their strategies for managing high economic volatility and addressing human development and gender inequality. Could you include information on their environmental protection and climate action initiatives? Lastly, what information do you have about democratic governance? And how the UNDP plans to partner to achieve these SDGs?
