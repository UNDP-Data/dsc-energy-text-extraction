I'm interested in Afghanistan's Renewable Energy Policy spanning from 2015 to 2023. Specifically, I would like to understand the types of renewable energy projects Afghanistan aims to implement, given its potential for Hydro, Wind, Solar, Geothermal, and Biomass energy. What socio-economic benefits and employment opportunities does the government anticipate from these renewable projects? I'm also keen to know about the government's two-term approach to policy implementationâ€”TERM 1 focusing on the Public-Private Partnership mode and TERM 2 on full commercialization, also some incentives, regulatory framework designed to attract private investment, and then monitoring, evaluation work after?
