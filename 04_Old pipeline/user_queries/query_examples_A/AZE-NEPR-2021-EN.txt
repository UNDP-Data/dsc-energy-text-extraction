Can you provide some information about Azerbaijan's energy policies and reforms in 2018-2023? I'm particularly interested in how the country plans to transition from a reliance on oil and gas towards a more efficient, dynamic, and sustainable energy system. What are their strategies for gas and electricity market reforms, energy efficiency, and renewable energy? Additionally, I'd like to know about the report's key policies, recommendations for energy security, and support measures for vulnerable citizens. Does the report also touch on energy research, development, and innovation?
