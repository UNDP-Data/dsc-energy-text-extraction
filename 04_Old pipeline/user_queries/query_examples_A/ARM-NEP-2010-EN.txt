I'm looking to explore how Armenia addressed energy efficiency in 2010. Specifically, I'm curious about the government's focus areas like residential buildings, industry, transport, and agriculture. What measures are planned for these sectors? Additionally, I'm interested in the social aspects of the plan, such as initiatives to improve legal frameworks, build capacity, and raise awareness. Could you also highlight the high-priority measures slated for implementation by 2013? Lastly, how does the plan aim to monitor and evaluate its progress?
