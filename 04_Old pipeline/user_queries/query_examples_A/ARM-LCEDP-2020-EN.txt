Could you share insights from Armenia's Least Cost Energy Development Plan from 2020 to 2036? I'm interested in understanding the energy landscape, from resource extraction and generation to end-use demands. Specifically, what are the most cost-effective patterns for utilizing energy resources and developing technologies? I'm also interested in Armenia's strategies for market liberalization and electricity trade. Could you elaborate on plans for GHG emissions control, GDP growth, and different projected scenarios? Additional details on energy imports, supply, energy price, and end-use consumption dynamic would be appreciated.
