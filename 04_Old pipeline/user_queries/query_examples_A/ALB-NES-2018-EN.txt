I'm interested in the Albanian National Energy Strategy for 2017â€“2030. What is the energy sector vision for 2030? I'm interested in how the country plans to diversify domestic energy sources, enhance energy efficiency, fully integrate into the European market, address climate actions, and improve social welfare. Could you also detail the framework laws, as well as the structural, legal, and tariff reforms that are focused on the electricity sector? Additionally, what are the key developments in the oil, gas and renewables sector? Some key strategies planned to achieve goals would be interesting. Also, how has Albania been meeting its regional integration commitments through the Energy Community and other international obligations related to climate action?
