I'm interested in understanding how Armenia is working to improve its energy security through renewable energy sources. The country has faced energy challenges due to its lack of hydrocarbon resources and dependence on Russian imports. Could you provide insights into Armenia's renewable energy policies and initiatives, particularly in the context of solar power? I'm also curious about the role of foreign direct investment in developing Armenia's renewable energy sector and its implications for energy security.
