I'm looking for information about Azerbaijan's economic and social development initiatives from 2021 to 2025. Specifically, I want to understand the government's approach to achieving socially inclusive and sustainable economic growth, with a special emphasis on a growing non-oil economy. Additionally, how are they managing the impacts of the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and the COVID-19 pandemic? Could you also provide details on initiatives aimed at achieving SDGs, reducing inequity, and meeting climate change goals? I'm also curious about the role of UNDP support in these efforts.
