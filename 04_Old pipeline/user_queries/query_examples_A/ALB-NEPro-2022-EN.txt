Could you provide information on Albania's energy supply trends data from 2014 to 2022? I'm interested in understanding the country's shift between non-renewable and renewable energy sources. I'd also like insights into their energy self-sufficiency percentages and primary energy trade including imports and exports. Some data around access to electricity, cooking; energy intensity would also be interesting.
