I'm interested in Albania's energy transition strategies from 2019 to 2022. I'd like to understand their approach to organizing energy sobriety, focusing on optimizing urban areas, transport, and high-efficiency building standards. What steps are being taken to develop an efficient and energy-efficient productive sector? Additionally, I'm curious about their demand-side management programmes and how these align with the Paris Agreement and social objectives. Could you also provide details on the French-German initiative supporting Albania's transition to a low-carbon building sector? Are there any policy support and initiatives with other countries?
