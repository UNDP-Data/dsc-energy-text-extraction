Can you provide me with information about Azerbaijan's energy profile from 2014 to 2022? Specifically, can you provide me with some data or shifts about energy metrics such as Total Energy Supply (TES)? I am particularly interested in the share between renewable and non-renewable energy. Could you also provide data on their energy trade, including imports and exports, as well as how they align with SDGs like access to electricity and renewable energy percentage in total final energy consumption?
