I'm interested in understanding the 2021 status of renewable energy in Albania, specifically focusing on the current and future development plan. How is Albania strategizing to diversify its energy portfolio, particularly leveraging its resources such as solar and wind? Are there financial instruments like PPAs that have been deployed to stimulate investment? What is the role of key government actors in formulating Albania's renewable energy policies?
