I'm looking for insights into the Country Program Document for Afghanistan for the year 2014. I'm particularly interested in understanding Afghanistan's strategies related to economic development, governance, and social inclusion. Additionally, I'd like to know about any partnerships with international organizations such as UNDP, poverty reduction initiatives, and gender equality measures included in the program. Can you also provide details on how they planned to address security issues and sustainable development goals during that timeframe 2015-2019?
