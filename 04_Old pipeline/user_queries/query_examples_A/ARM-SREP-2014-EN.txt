I want to know how Armenia is scaling up its renewable energy from 2014 to 2025, focusing on financial investment. Specifically, I'm curious about how the program aims to improve energy security, remove dependence, and contribute to climate change mitigation. Could you highlight the key technologies and projects in the plan, like geothermal power and utility-scale solar PV? I'm also interested in learning about the current state of energy supply and demand as well as costs and pricing. Lastly, I want to understand the role of the private sector and how international development partners like WBG, EBRD, and ADB are involved in the plan.
