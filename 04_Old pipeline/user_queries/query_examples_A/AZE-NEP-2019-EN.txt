I'm interested in information about Azerbaijan's Sustainable Energy development from 1990 to 2030. I want to understand their energy landscape, including the percentage of renewables and non-renewables. What are their trade patterns for energy import and export with the European market? I'm interested about its energy consumption by sectors. Also, can you highlight the government's strategies and initiatives for GDP growth, job creation, and the expansion of renewable energy capacities? Additional insights into their investment in wind energy, solar energy, and bioenergy would be great.
