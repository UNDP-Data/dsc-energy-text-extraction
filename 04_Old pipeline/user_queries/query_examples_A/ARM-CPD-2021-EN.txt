Can you tell me more about Armenia country development from 2021 to 2025. Given some challenges such as poverty, gender inequality, and climate change vulnerability, which were exacerbated by COVID-19 and the recent military hostilities, how is America working on that and partnering with UNDP's program in building a cohesive, inclusive, and resilient society? Can you tell me some initiatives and programs aim to enhance governance systems, natural resource management, and economic sustainability? Additionally, I'm curious about how UNDP is collaborating with public, private, and civil stakeholders to address these issues.
