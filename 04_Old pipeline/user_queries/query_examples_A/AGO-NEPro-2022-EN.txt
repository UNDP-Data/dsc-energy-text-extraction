I'm interested in the data about Angola's energy sector from 2014 to 2022. I am interested in metrics such as Total Energy Supply (TES), as well as growth in renewable and non-renewable energy. Could you provide more context around the renewable energy's share increasing? What initiatives or policies have been implemented to contribute to this growth? I'm also keen to know about Angola's energy self-sufficiency. And how do these renewables relate to Angola's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?
