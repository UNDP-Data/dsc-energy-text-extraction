I'm interested in learning more about Afghanistan's Renewable Energy Roadmap from 2017 to 2032. Specifically, I would like to understand the country's strategies for energy access and energy security through renewable sources. Could you provide details about the priority areas identified and its supporting partners, such as the Asian Development Bank? I'm also keen to know about some specific renewable technology projects involved like Daikundi mini-grid, Kabul roof-top solar, etc? How do these projects align with the country's larger National Energy Supply Programme and what are the financing institutions involved?
