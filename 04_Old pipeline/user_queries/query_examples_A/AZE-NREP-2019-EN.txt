Can you provide information on Azerbaijan's National Renewable Energy Policy from 2019 to 2050, particularly through the Renewables Readiness Assessment? I'm interested in the strategic framework for renewables. What are the drivers and challenges behind the deployment of renewable energy in the country? Also, what policy and financial support mechanisms? I'm also interested in understanding the country's long-term energy planning profile, and some recommendations such as financing options for renewable energy and grid regulation would be helpful.
