I'm interested in Afghanistan Renewable Energy Policy, especially in the rural area in 2013, also the future focus from 2017 to 2027. I'd like to learn more about the policy objectives and guiding principles, but also what barriers have been identified to the implementation of renewable rural energy policies? What is the legal and regulatory framework underpinning this policy? Can you break into short-term, medium-term, and long-term implementation strategies as well as institutional frameworks involving inter-ministerial coordination and stakeholder involvement?
